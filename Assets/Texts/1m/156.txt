In his early years, Breitbart was left-wing, shifting in his beliefs upon an epiphany, while watching the late 1991 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, due to what he considered unfounded attacks on the part of liberals based on former employee Anita Hill’s sexual harassment accusations. Breitbart described himself as a Reagan conservative, with libertarian sympathies.

Breitbart’s conservatism was refined by listening to such conservative hosts as Rush Limbaugh, igniting an interest in learning that he had suppressed as a result of his distaste for the "nihilistic musings of dead critical theorists" that had dominated his studies at Tulane. In this era, Breitbart also read Camille Paglia's book "Sexual Personae" (1990), a massive survey of Western art, literature and culture from ancient Egypt to the 20th century, which, he wrote, "made me realize how little I really had learned in college."

Breitbart self-identified as "eighty-five percent conservative, fifteen percent libertarian".

Nabucco

Nabucco is an opera by Giuseppe Verdi. Verdi composed it in 1841. It was first perfomed at La Scala, in Milan in 1842. It has two main themes, the Jews wanting to escape from Babylonian servitude, and Nebuchadnezzar II, called Nabucco, overestimating his power, and wanting to become a god. Nabucco goes insane while trying, and only when he becomes the God of the jews, is he cured from his insanity.
The opera has four acts, and performances last about 2hrs 15 minutes. Nabucco was Verdi's first successful opera.

Denzo Ishizaki

Although his birth date is officially verified as October 20, 1886, Ishizaki himself claimed to be born two years earlier, and thereby ten days older than Gengan Tonaki who would have been the second-oldest living Japanese man at the time of his death on January 24, 1997, and asserted that his birth record was "delayed by two years", which would have made Ishizaki the oldest living man in Japan after Gihei Oka's death on September 28, 1991 as well as the oldest living Japanese man overall on February 16, 1992 when Russo-Japanese War veteran Mamoru Eto, who was four days younger than Gihei Oka and had emigrated to the United States, died at age 109 years, 13 days and only the second Japanese man who became a supercentenarian, after Eiju Tsuru who died on January 11, 1990.

After Gengan Tonaki's death on January 24, 1997, Ishizaki might have become the last living man born in 1884 and also the oldest living man in the world after 115-years-old Danish-born American man Christian Mortensen's death on April 25, 1998, although the American man Johnson Parks, who died on July 17 the same year, has been suggested to have been five days older than Ishizaki and another American man, Walter Richardson who died at age 113 later on December 25, is officially verified to have been less than a year older rather than over a year younger than Ishizaki.

Ishizaki was officially verified as the oldest living Japanese person, and the first man who became Japan's oldest person after Masutaro Sato who died on October 6, 1978, after Tase Matsunaga's death on November 18, 1998.

Ishizaki died of multiple organ failure on April 29, 1999 at age 114 years, 191 days "or" 112 years, 191 days and might at the time of his death have been, along with Tase Matsunaga, the third-oldest Japanese persons ever behind Tane Ikai and Hide Ohira and the youngest of only two men who became at least 114 years old, behind Christian Mortensen.

Ishizaki was succeeded as the world's oldest living man by Spaniard Antonio Urrea, as Japan's oldest living man by Sadayoshi Tanabe and as Japan's oldest living person by Kayo Fujii, although Kamato Hongo was still believed to have been older.

Iblis

Iblis is a character mentioned in the Quran. He is a fallen angel who refused to bow before Adam. This is because Iblis thought that he was better than Adam. Because he felt from heaven, he is often compared to Lucifer. However, Iblis is not God's enemy, he is only the enemy of djinn and humans.

Since the Quran tells about stories, the explanation is provided in books called tafsir. 
The tafsirs explain that before Adam, djinn lived on earth. Djinn have, like humans, free will. However, the djinn became more and more evil. When God was fed up with the djinn, he decided to kill the djinn by an army of angels. The leader of the angels was Iblis. After the djinn died or hid themselves from the angels, Iblis felt proud. He thought he was the favorite creature of God now. 

However, God decided to create a new creature with free will instead. Then God commanded Iblis to bow before Adam as a sign of respect. Iblis was disappointed and felt that this command was unjust. Instead, he wanted to destroy humans as he destroyed the djinn before. Because of his arrogant actions, he was dismissed from his angelic duties. When Iblis lost his angelic nature, he became a devil and was not able to return to heaven. Some scholars also add, that his name before his fall was Azazel, but his name became Iblis when he turned into a devil. As a devil, he wants to prove that the other creatures are inferior to him.

Since the tafsir is an explanation, disagreements are also recorded. The story of Iblis is not mentioned in the Quran, but is explained by Muhammad 's followers. Two followers disagreed. Ibn Abbas said that Iblis was an angel called Azazel, who was made from fire and he was the leader of the angels. Hasan Basri said, that he was not a real angel, since angels would not make bad decisions. He argues, that Iblis has always been a devil. Therefore, traditional Muslims have one of these two views about Iblis.

Islam scholars explain the meaning and purpose of the story for the Muslims. First, they explain, Iblis did not create evil. This is different from some Christians and Zoroastrianism who believe that Satan creates evil. Muslims believe that God creates both good and evil, but evil has a better purpose in the end.

Next, Muslims should not compare themselves to others (not be envious), because Iblis sinned when he compared himself to Adam. Muslims should also not be arrogant, since Iblis was arrogant. 

Iblis is also said to have children. His own children are called "shayāṭīn" (satans or devils). They come from eggs, because Iblis has no gender. Next, humans and remaining djinn who decide to become evil, also turn into devils and are Iblis' children. Since Iblis' children betrayed God, Iblis does not like them. Instead, he betrays his own people whenever he meets God or his angels. This is, for example, supposed to have happened at a battle between Muhammad and his enemies.

Harut and Marut

Harut and Marut are a pair of angels mentioned in the Qur'an. These angels are send down to earth and teach sorcery. Practicing sorcery is a sin Islam, so some Muslim theologians wondered how angels could do that. Some reject that Harut and Marut are really angels and that they are merely kings (in Arabic "kings" and "angels" are simialr words). Others argue that knowing or teaching sorcery isn't a sin. Only praticing it is a sin, like knowing to build an idol isn't a sin, but worshipping an idol is.

Muhammad's companions say that Harut and Marut have been angels in heaven who were outraged by human's sin. God then made a bet with the angels, that they wouldn't be better, if they lived on earth with human urges. They agreed but actually sinned on earth and so they were not allowed to return to heaven. Further, they have to choose their punishment, either in this world or in hell. They choose earth, and so they became (fallen) angels tempting people into sorcery.

Selim I

Selim I (10 October 1470 – 22 September 1520), also known as Selim The Grim or Selim the Resolute, was the 9th Sultan and the 1st caliph of the Ottoman Empire. He is known for his conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate, which made him caliph, and also for being the father of Suleiman the Magnificent. He is also known for crushing the power of the Safavids in the Battle of Chaldiran. He ruled between 1512 and 1520.

Selim was born on October 20, 1470, and was the youngest son of Bayezid II. Most historians believed that Ayşe Hatun was his wife.

Selim killed his 7 brothers and their 5 sons to capture the throne. He left his son Suleiman as the only heir.

Selim’s ambitions circled through Europe and Asia. Bayezid had left the Europeans relatively quiet and so the new King first turned to the east and picked the Safavids of Iran as his first victims. The relationship between the Ottomans and the Mamluks was hostile. Both states fought for control of the spice trade, and Selim dreamed of eventually taking control of the Holy Cities of Islam. He crushed the Safavid Iranian Empire and took control of what is now Armenia, Georgia, Chechnya, Dagestan and Azerbaijan. He then defeated and crushed the Mamluks and took control of the holy Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina. His conquest of Egypt finally gave him a base to launch attacks in the west, in North Africa. After defeating the Iranian Safavids, he captured the strategic cities of Tabriz and Baghdad. After he defeated the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo, he captured the entire Levant region and eventually conquered Egypt itself and captured Cairo. That effectively destroyed the Mamluk Sultanate and put an end to it. He captured all of its territories up to Libya in the west. He proceeded to turn his new territories into administrative divisions, the largest of them was the province of Syria. He also turned Egypt into a province with Cairo as its capital, but Egypt became under direct Ottoman control from the Ottoman capital, Constantinople.

Pope Pius XII proclaimed John Bosco a patron of Catholic publishers in 1949. Bosco had been popularly known as the patron saint of illusionists, on 30 January 2002, Silvio Mantelli petitioned Pope John Paul II to declare Bosco formally to the patron of stage magicians. Catholic stage magicians who practice gospel magic venerate Bosco by offering free magic shows to underprivileged children on his feast day.

Bosco's work was carried on by an early pupil, collaborator, and companion, Michael Rua, who was appointed rector major of the Salesian Society by Pope Leo XIII in 1888.

He is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 31 January.

Raimbaud was born on the 27th February in 1958, in Évreux, France. At the age of 14, he abandoned his studies in favor of training as a painter. He made his debut in drawing, although initially, he mainly drew billboards.

In 1975, he joined a small animation studio called DIC Entertainment, founded by Jean Chalopin. This was where he learned how to make cartoons. In the studio, he met the directors Bruno Bianchi ("Inspector Gadget") and Bernard Deyriès ("The Mysterious Cities of Gold").

In 1986, Raimbaud created his own studio, Jingle, with Christian Masson ( an advertiser and producer). 

It was not until 1988 that Jingle itself made a series: "Manu", created by cartoonist Frank Margerin. 104 episodes were shown on La Cinq, starting in March 1990. In 1992, the bankruptcy of La Cinq caused the closure of many companies, and in 1993, Jingle became bankrupt.

By then, Raimbaud was well known, and Gaumont Film Company hired him to revive the films of Asterix and Lucky Luke that were last produced in the 1970s. Raimbaud was promoted to artistic director of the new studio, Gaumont Multimedia. Raimbaud began working on "Highlander: The Series" for M6. During this time, he also created the series ""The Little Witches"." The series was produced by Millésime Productions for TF1, and it was sold cheaply in Europe. Raimbaud created the series ""Home to Rent"" in the style of 1950s cartoons. The title of the series became ""Space Goofs"" during its broadcast in France in September 1997. The series became one of the most popular programs introduced. It was also exported beyond France. 

Raimbaud had been diagnosed with lung cancer in the early 1990s according to a doctor, and he died of it on June 28, 1998, in Paris, France.

"Space Goofs" was popular with children and adults. It received a second season in the 2000s, a single of "Monster Men" (the theme song, by Iggy Pop), a few DVD releases, a video game adaptation co-produced by Ubisoft Entertainment, and an unfinished film adaptation that only had one preview available online. 

However, "Oggy and the Cockroaches" became his longest-running franchise, due to it being under Xilam's ownership – receiving 7 seasons, 2 spinoffs ("Oggy Oggy" and "Oggy and the Cockroaches Next Generation"), and .

Reece Joel Oxford (born 16 December 1998) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for Bundesliga club FC Augsburg. Oxford made his debut for West Ham United aged 16 years and 198 days, making him the club's youngest ever player, beating a record of 16 years and 221 days set in 1922 by Billy Williams.

Oxford was born in Edmonton, London, and was a childhood supporter of Arsenal. He began playing football at Tottenham Hotspur's academy but was released from the club in 2011. He then joined West Ham United at under-13 level. He turned out for the under-18 team while still an under-15 schoolboy, and made the bench for a League Cup match in August 2014, still aged 15.

On 11 January 2015, Oxford signed a long-term professional contract with West Ham. Four months later, he won the Dylan Tombides Academy Player of the Year Award.

Oxford made his competitive, first team debut on 2 July 2015, aged 16, starting in midfield in a 3–0 win against Andorran club Lusitanos in a UEFA Europa League first qualifying round first leg draw. In so doing, he became West Ham's youngest ever player. He then made his Premier League debut on 9 August, playing the first 79 minutes before being substituted for Kevin Nolan as West Ham won 2–0 away to Arsenal. Following his start, Oxford became the second-youngest Premier League starter of all-time, after Jose Baxter.

Ahead of the 2016–17 season, Oxford was named in "The Daily Telegraph"'s list of the best youth prospects in English football. On his 18th birthday, 16 December 2016, Oxford signed a new, four-and-a-half year contract with West Ham. Just over one month later, he was sent on loan to Reading for the remainder of the season. He made his Reading debut on 11 March 2017 in a 3–0 away defeat to Preston North End, coming on as a second-half substitute for Paul McShane. He made five appearances, his final match being the 8 April away loss to Norwich City, 7–1.

On 21 June 2017, Oxford was sent on loan to Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach for the 2017–18 season. He did not make his debut until 28 October when he came on as an 89th-minute substitute for Lars Stindl in a 1–3 win against Hoffenheim. On 12 December, Oxford made his first league start for "Gladbach", against Freiburg. After the match, sporting director Max Eberl praised Oxford's development during his time at the club and stated talks had taken place over a permanent deal. His loan was cut short and he returned to West Ham on 29 December 2017.

On 31 January 2018, Oxford was loaned to Borussia Mönchengladbach again.

On 31 January 2019, Oxford again went out on loan, this time joining Bundesliga club FC Augsburg until the end of the season. Oxford made nine appearances for Augsburg, his final game coming in the last day of the Bundesliga season in an 8–1 defeat by Wolfsburg. On 2 August 2019, Oxford joined Augsburg permanently on a four-year deal.

Oxford has played for England up to under-20 level and captained his country at the 2015 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. The Young Lions reached the quarter-finals, and Oxford scored in the penalty shootout as they defeated Spain in a play-off for the 2015 U-17 World Cup. West Ham refused permission for him to play in the U17 World Cup in Chile, fearing that playing in an international football tournament would lead to burnout.

UEFA.com has described his playing style as, "Tall and quick, he is not daunted in the face of illustrious opponents." On several occasions, Oxford has been compared to former West Ham academy graduate Rio Ferdinand.

Oxford is of Jamaican descent through his grandfather. His grandfather, Karl, is the brother of the Jamaican footballer Neville Oxford. In December 2018, Oxford was the victim of a theft when his 18-carat Rolex watch was stolen from the changing rooms at West Ham's Chadwell Heath training ground.

Chaharshanbe Suri

Chaharshanbe Suri is an Iranian festival celebrated on the eve of the last Wednesday before Nowruz. It is also the first festivity of the Nowruz Celebrations festivals (the Iranian New Year).

Chaharshanbe in Persian means Wednesday and Suri means red or fire or sun.
The sun was one of the early Gods of the people in old times, praise of the sun have deep root in the old festivals and Suri festival also has relation with the praise of sun and the dead. Sur means red also means sun solar deity and Surya with the same root of the Sul. As Herodotus explained Ertaeyan(Iranian) were worshiping the sun. the importance of fire can be felt while we look at the stone inscriptions of Achaemenid kings also the very first mantra of Rig Veda is in the praise of Fire. Chaharshanbe Suri and Holi festival had the same roots in ancient Arian religions. 

Before the start of the festival, people gather brushwood in an open space. At sunset, after making one or more bonfires, they jump over the flames, singing , literally meaning "[let] your redness [be] mine, my paleness yours", or a local equivalent of it. This is considered a purification practice.

Another popular practice on Čahāršanba-sūrī is fortune telling from a jug (fāl-e kūza, fāl-e bolūnī), usually one with a wide mouth (bolūnī). 
Burning rue seeds (esfand) or frankincense (kondor) at parties on the eve of Čahāršanba-sūrī is a widespread practice in most regions of Persia. It is considered a necessary precaution against the evil eye and malevolent spirits, devils, and genies (cf. above on fumigation to avoid the evil eye). While rue and a small amount of salt are thrown on the fire the people recite rhymes, which, though varying with the local dialects, usually go something like this: “Rue shrubs and rue seeds (esfandūne, i.e., esfand-dāna), rue shrubs with thirty-three seeds (dūne), rue shrubs know themselves; let them blast (be-tarkūne, i.e., be-tarakānad) the jealous eye” (or “the evil eye”).
The festival has its origin in ancient Iranian rituals. The ancient Iranians celebrated the festival of Hamaspathmaedaya (), the last five days of the year in honor of the spirits of the dead. This is today referred to as "Farvardinegan". They believed that the spirits of the dead would come for reunion. The seven holy immortals () were honored, and were bidden a formal ritual farewell at the dawn of the New Year. The festival also coincided with festivals celebrating the creation of fire and humans. By the time of the Sasanian Empire, the festival was divided into two distinct pentads. They are known as the lesser and the greater . The belief had gradually developed that the "lesser " belonged to the souls of children and those who died without sin, while the "greater " was for all souls.

Dmitry Bortniansky

Dmitry Stepanovich Bortniansky (; ; 28 October 1751 in Glukhov 10 October 1825 in St. Petersburg) was a Russian and Ukrainian composer and musician. He was an important composer of Orthodox church music.

Bortniansky was born in Glukhov, Russian Empire (now in Ukraine). He studied music and sang in the local church. People noticed that he had a beautiful voice. So, he was chosen to become a singer in the imperial chapel choir in St. Petersburg. He was able to study music and composition in St. Petersburg. He studied music with Baldassare Galuppi. Galuppi returned to Venice in 1768. Galuppi asked Empress Catherine to send Bortniansky to Italy. Catherine accepted this request. She sent Bortniansky to Venice. 

In Venice, Bortniansky continued his training with Galuppi. In 1776, his first opera, "Creonte" was performed in Venice. However, it was not a success. So, he wrote two more operas, "Alcide" and "Quinto Fabio" in 1778. These were successful. In Italy, he also wrote music for Catholic liturgy. This includes an "Ave Maria".

Bortniansky returned to St. Petersburg in 1779. He became a composer in the imperial court chapel. In 1783, he became the "Kapellmeister" for Prince Paul. In 1796 Prince Paul became Emperor of Russia. He made Bortniansky the director of the Imperial Chapel. 

The imperial court chapel was in a bad condition. The singers were not talented. They were not disciplined. Bortniansky worked to improve the chapel. He improved the living conditions of singers. He increased the singer's salaries. He made sure that the singers received proper education. He introduced choral music from Western European composers. This includes Mozart, Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven.

In 1816, the imperial court chapel received a monopoly for all church music. This means that Bortniansky had full control of the church music in the Russian Empire. He gets to say if a piece of church music can be published or not. However, Bortniansky never published any of his own compositions.

Bortniansky died in St Petersburg on October 10, 1825. It is said that he invited the court chapel to his house before he died. He wanted to hear his favorite choral concerto, "Vskuyu Priskorbna Yesi, Dusha Moya?" (English: "Why are you mournful, O my soul?"). He died after the choir finished singing.

Bortniansky's greatest contribution was his church music. He was an important composer of the choral concerto. He was not allowed to use musical instruments in his church music. This is because the Orthodox Church does not allow musical instruments in their church.

Bortniansky wrote over 100 religious pieces. Tchaikovsky edited his works after he died. Tchaikovsky later regretted his decision. He did not think that Bortniansky's music was good. He thought that Bortniansky's music did not fit Russian Orthodox liturgy. On the other hand, Hector Berlioz praised Bortniansky's music.

Repunit

A repunit is a number like 11, 111, or 1111. It only has the digit 1 in it. It is a more specific type of repdigit. The term stands for repeated unit and was coined in 1966 by Albert H. Beiler in his book "Recreations in the Theory of Numbers".

A repunit prime is a repunit that is also a prime number. Primes that are repunits in base-2 are Mersenne primes.

The base-"b" repunits can be written as this where "b" is the base and "n" is the number that you are checking in whether or not it is a repunit:

This means that the number "R" is made of of of "n" copies of the digit 1 in base-"b" representation. The first two repunits base-"b" for "n" = 1 and "n" = 2 are 

The first of repunits in base-10 are with

Base-2 repunits are also Mersenne numbers "M" = 2 − 1. They start with

Prime factors that are are "new factors" that haven't been mentioned before. Basically, the prime factor divides "R" but does not divide "R" for all "k" < "n." 

The smallest prime factors of "R" for "n" > 1 are

A few years later, they moved south to the United States briefly living in Galena, Kansas before settling in Pasadena, California. Leonard established his studio in Pasadena. He also kept studios in Redlands, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles. 

In 1901 he returned to England where he set up a studio in a castle. He got sick and became unconscious (he didn’t know for how long) and was feeble with asthma after that incident. The following year Leonard went to Germany, then hitch-hiked and walked to France and Italy with a walking stick he made from an apricot tree. 

Leonard created drawings for the Chicago World’s fair in 1893, and in 1894 Harper Brothers magazine paid him $75 for photo-like drawings of Native American baskets. While in Chicago, he met the leader of the Theosophical Society and became a member. After studying art for two years (1894-96) at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Art Students’ League in New York City, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, he returned to California. 

From 1906 to 1916, Leonard went to Cuba where he taught at a Theosophical school directed by his sister, Amy Lester Reineman. He visited Pinar del Rio, Las Quatitas and Santiago. The schools closed during the war, so he came back to the United States. 

In the 1920s he lived and worked at Madam Tingley’s Theosophical School, Roja Yoga College, at Pt. Loma, Califonria. Following the 1929 stock market crash, many of the older Lomaland residents who could support themselves were requested to leave to help ease the bad financial situation. 

In 1930 he moved to Alpine, California and, on January 4, 1931, he married Marian Plummer, an artist and former teacher at the Theosophical school. For awhile they lived just off of Tavern Road. He and Marian had a studio at the Julian Eltenge Ranch. Compared with other San Diego County artists he was relatively unknown because his poor health prevented him from entering many exhibitions. He was respected by the art community and his paintings won awards in the United States and abroad. In April of 1937, Leonard exhibited a group of his paintings and pastel drawings at Studio 6 the House of Hospitality, Balboa Park, San Diego. 

Leonard lived in the San Diego area at intervals totalling 35 years. He didn’t consider himself a great artist. He was a modest man who shunned publicity. He attributed most of his success to his artwork being nature studies. He continued painting up until a year before his death. Leonard died at the age of 82, at 3:33 a.m. on June 26th, the same time and date as his mother. She died in 1906. Fellow artists recalled him as a quiet, gentle man, who looked like a scholar and painted like a poet. 

According to Leonard’s widow, Marian Plummer Lester (1893-1991), he was a skilled writer and speaker. Marion willed most of Leonard’s artwork to the University of California at La Jolla. Her collection of photographs and documents relating to the Plummer family, containing some photographs of Leonard, were donated to the San Diego Historical Society. 

At Point Loma Art School, Leonard was part of a movement referred to as Symbolist art. 

Interest in religious mysticism in the nineteenth century more-or-less paralleled the Romantic Movement in art. There was a shift in consciousness that caused artists and writers to distrust the growing materialism of their times, to strike out against the Age of Reason, and to question the ability of reason to govern all things. Artists turned toward their inner experience and tried to create an art that could embody their dreams and emotions in pictorial forms. Visionary artists such as William Blake and certain of the Pre-Raphaelites and their followers, particularly Edward Burne-Jones, paved the way for the Symbolist Art Movement that flourished at the end of the century. Symbolist art, by using rhythms, colors, and symbols, created visual images that conveyed ideas, emotions and moods far above the obvious level of what was actually being depicted. It was an art that appealed to those who wished to remove themselves from the materialism and boredom of everyday life, and seek a higher level of consciousness.

Leonard’s drawings in pencil and crayon are particularly delicate of touch and sensitive to detail. His work reveals an artist who was very close to nature. His scenes have a quiet serene quality sometimes described as mystic. His works have been described as among the most ethereal produced by Lomaland painters. Especially superb are his atmospheric effects which have a beauty and soothing calmness that makes the onlooker feel at peace. 

Leonard was an accomplished writer and his philosophy on art was expressed in a number of articles in a Theosophy publication called “The Theosophical Path.” He encouraged his readers to seek an escape from what he termed “external realism” by looking for a deeper knowledge or Reality. He wrote the following on page 74 of The Theosophical Path11: 

“Where there is no vision, the people perish;” –and this is also true of Art. To be vitally creative, its vision must be open to the higher planes of Reality. The extreme reaction from so-called Realism in the art tendencies today, is, for the most part, but the substitution of other forms of externalism, equally limited in their appeal to sensation. 

Leonard wrote the following: 

Seeking to gain advantage over and excel others, or to excel in any pursuit for the sake of personal profit or advantage is not a high object at all. To suffer some disadvantage, some physical handicap may then become a blessing. Less preoccupation over the personal self, over efforts to excel or shine to advantage, to gain respect or admiration from others; and more resignation to the law, sympathy for others, letting trifling ambitions alone, treating things ‘large and bye’. The gradual substitution of this state for the other is a step in advance on the pathway of ordinary daily life.

Part of Leonard’s philosophy is revealed by the poem “The Salutation of the Dawn” by the Hindu poet Kalidasa, who lived sometime between the 3rd and 6th century A.D. and referred to as the “Shakespeare of India.” Leonard made a drawing with the same title. The poem reads: 

Listen to the exhortation of the dawn! 

Look to this day, for it is life, 

The very life of life! 

In its brief course lie all the verities 

And all the realities of your existence; 

The bliss of growth; the glory of action; 

The splendor of beauty. 

For yesterday is but a dream, 

And tomorrow is only a vision. 

But today well-lived makes every yesterday 

A dream of happiness, 

And every tomorrow a vision of hope. 

Look well, therefore, to this day. 

Such is the salutation of the dawn.

Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation

Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation is an 1844 work by Robert Chambers. It was published anonymously in England. 
The book openly discussed the transmutation of species in an attractive way.

"Vestiges" became an international bestseller. Its theme contradicted the natural theology fashionable at the time. Its ideas were reviled by clergymen. The ideas in the book were popular with a wider public. Prince Albert read it aloud to Queen Victoria in 1845. "Vestiges" caused a shift in popular opinion which – Charles Darwin believed – prepared the public mind for the scientific theories of evolution by natural selection as in his "On the Origin of Species" in 1859.

For decades there was speculation about the authorship of "Vestiges". The 12th edition of 1884, revealed that the author was Robert Chambers, a Scottish journalist. He had written the book in St Andrews between 1841 and 1844 while recovering from illness. Initially, Chambers had proposed the title "The Natural History of Creation", but he was persuaded to revise the title in deference to the Scottish geologist James Hutton. Hutton had remarked of the timeless aspect of geology: "no "vestige" of a beginning, no "prospect" of an end". 

The book was published in October 1844 by John Churchill in London. The secret of the authorship was kept from from Churchill.

"In other words, the fact of extinction — which can be observed in the fossil layers — suggests that some designs were flawed... Some other idea must then come with regard to the mode in which the Divine Author proceeded in the organic creation. (p153)

"...how can we suppose that the august Being who brought all these countless worlds into form by the simple establishment of a natural principle flowing from his mind, was to interfere personally and specially on every occasion when a new shell-fish or reptile was to be ushered into existence on one of these worlds? Surely this idea is too ridiculous to be for a moment entertained". (p154)

The general scandal caused by "Vestiges" meant Darwin was reluctant to publish his own ideas until he had well researched answers to all possible objections.

The first edition of 1,750 copies sold out in a few days. The book was translated into five languages, and many editions were published in the U.S.A.

Chambers followed the book with another, this time dealing with all the questions raised by the first book: Chambers, Robert 1845. "Explanations: a sequel to Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation". London: John Churchill.

Nyctimantis rugiceps

The brown-eyed tree frog ("Nyctimantis rugiceps") is a frog that lives in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Scientists think it might live in Brazil too. Scientists have seen it between 200 and 1200 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 55.3 to 67.6 mm long from nose to rear end. The adult female frog is 59.7 to 63.0 mm long. The frog's skin is brown in color. It is dark brown on the sides and toes and light brown on the back. It has one to three large orange spots by its middle. It has a wide head, big black eyes, and large disks on its toes for climbing. It lives in primary forest and secondary forest in the Amazon lowlands.

The male frog finds a hole in a tree trunk with a pool of water in it 10 to 40 cm deep. The holes are sometimes as close to the ground as 2 meters, but there are more of them more than 10 meters above the ground. If something frightens the male frog, it will hide in the water. The female frog comes to the tree trunk and lays her eggs in the water. The male frog sings all year, and he may stay near the same place for a long time.

The female frog lays her eggs in the hole and the male frog fertilizes them. The female comes back to the hole to lay unfertilized eggs, which the tadpoles eat.

Action movie

Action movie is a movie genre in which the protagonist is put into a series of events that usually have violence and physical actions. 

The genre is usually about a resourceful hero fighting against high odds. These movies often have life-threatening situations, a villain, or a chase which usually ends in victory for the hero. Action movies became cheaper and easier to make as computer-generated imagery (CGI) changed. Action sequences and other visual effects that needed stunt crews were more expensive in the past. Reactions to action movies with a large amount of CGI have been mixed. Some movies use CGI to create events that are not realistic and are unbelievable. Action has been a part of movies for a long time but the "action movie" genre did not start until the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects.

This genre is often used with the thriller and adventure genres. It can also have elements of comedy, drama and spy fiction. Screenwriter Eric R. Williams says action movies are one of 11 super-genres in his screenwriters’ taxonomy. He says that all feature-length narrative movies can be classified by these super-genres. The other 10 super-genres are Crime, Fantasy, Horror, Romance, Science Fiction, Slice of Life, Sports, Thriller, War and Western.

Some historians say "The Great Train Robbery" (1903) was the first action movie. During the 1920s and 1930s, action-based movie were often swashbuckling adventure movie. In these movies actors such as Douglas Fairbanks used swords. Indian action movies of this time were known as stunt movies.

The 1940s and 1950s saw "action" in a new form. Many movies were war and cowboy movies. Alfred Hitchcock started the spy-adventure genre. He also began the use of action-oriented "set pieces" those used in "North by Northwest" (1959). The movie led producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman to create their own spy-adventure in the James Bond series. These movies were based the novels of Ian Fleming.

In Japan, the 1950s saw the jidaigeki action movies. The most notable of these were the samurai movies made famous by Akira Kurosawa. His 1954 movie "Seven Samurai" is said to be one of the greatest action movie of all time. The movie is often seen as one of the most "remade, reworked, referenced" movie in cinema. It made the "assembling the team" trope popular. It has become a common trope in many action and heist movies. The look, plot and dialogue of the movie have affected many people who make movies. They range from George Lucas and John Landis to Quentin Tarantino and George Miller. Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (1961) was also remade as Sergio Leone's "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964). "Fistfull of Dollars" created the "Spaghetti Western" action genre of Italian cinema/ Kurosawa's "The Hidden Fortress" (1958) later inspired "Star Wars" (1977).

The James Bond movie series were the most popular action movies of the 1960s. They created the "resourseful hero". This character type is used in most modern-day action movies: . These larger-than-life characters were a "one-man army". They could defeat the villians in many creative ways.

"Parthenopē" founded the city of Naples. Two symbols were proposed for Parthenope: a fish and a star () and later a lyre (). Both are not used anymore.

On 6 August 2008, during a perihelic opposition, Parthenope had an apparent magnitude of 8.8.

In 1988, a UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories looked for it, but they never found it.

It has a rotation period of 13.722 ± 0.001 hours, Its brightness is anywhere from 0.10 ± 0.0s in magnitude.

In 2007, Baer and Chesley discovered that it is of 6.3 kg. It had a density of 3.3 g/cm. In 2008, it was found that it could have a mass of 6.15 instead. In 1997 and 2001, it was thought that that it was 5 kg and had a density 2.7 g/cm.

Observation arc

An observation arc (or arc length) of a Solar System body is the amount of time between its earliest and latest observations. It is used for finding its path. It is usually given in days or years. It is used asteroids and comets to find where they go.

A very short arc makes an inaccurate result. Sometimes, the original amount of time is short to figure out if something orbits Earth or the asteroid belt.

For example, was thought to be a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet after an arc-length of one day. Now it is known to be in the 1 km main-belt asteroid.

An observation arc less than 30 days can make it difficult to figure out an Inner Solar System object more than a year after the last observation. It can make the planet lost. Trans-Neptunian objects with observation arcs less than a few years usually have bad results.

As a general rule objects discovered when they are currently farther from the Sun will have greater uncertainties in their initial orbits if the observation arcs are short.

It took an observation arc of about 200 days to confirm that there was an impact on Mars by Oort cloud comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring).

Interstellar objects usually need an arc of 2–3 weeks with hundreds of observations to confirm that it has a hyperbolic excess velocity (interstellar speed) of more than a few km/s.

The Comet Swift–Tuttle has a 257-year observation arc. It's closest approach to Earth on 5 August 2126 is about ±10 thousand km. With an observation arc of ~1 year, the uncertainty in 's closest approach to Earth on 23 March 2147 is about ±2 million km.

Nyctimantis brunoi

Bruno's casque-headed frog or Bruno's bony-headed frog ("Nyctimantis brunoi") is a frog that lives in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Scientists think it might live in Brazil too. Scientists have seen it between 200 and 1200 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 48.88 to 62.42 mm long from nose to rear end. The adult female frog is 56.32 to 81.24 mm long. The frog's head is longer than it is wide.

This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. This frog has a bony head. It looks for holes in trees where it can hide. The frog goes into the hole and then puts its head against the opening to cover it. This frog can make a substance in its skin. The substance has chemicals and toxins in it that can make human skin hurt. Scientists think the frog might make this substance to stop other animals from eating it, but they have never seen the frog do this. When a human scientist picks up the frog, it usually stays very still. Scientists think the frog escapes from predators by pretending to be dead.

This frog does not lay eggs in holes in trees. Scientists are not sure, but they think it lays eggs in temporary bodies of water that form on the sand during the rainy season. The female frog lays eggs early so the tadpoles have time to grow into young frogs before the pools dry up.

This frog will eat almost any animal with bones on the outside, for example insects, spiders, and centipedes. But it can also eat some plants. It will eat other frogs if it can catch them.

This frog is not in danger of dying out but there are fewer ofthem than there were because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Human beings cut down forests to build farms and cities and to allow animals to eat grass.

David Bennett Sr.

David Bennett Sr. (1964 – March 8, 2022) was an American medical patient. He was the first patient to have a xenotransplantation with a genetically modified heart. On January 7, 2022, aged 57, he received the heart of a gene-edited pig. He was born in Maryland.

Bennett died in Baltimore, Maryland on March 8, 2022, at the age of 57.

Bennett suffered from advanced heart failure, accompanied by cardiac arrhythmias. Due to insufficient adherence to therapy - among other things, he had not made sufficient efforts to control his blood pressure - the treating physicians saw him as unsuitable for an allotransplantation. There were doubts as to whether, given the very scarce human organs, one should be able to give one to a person whose subsequent compliance was not assured. Therefore, with Bennett's approval, an exemption was sought from the Food and Drug Administration to perform a pig heart transplant.

The procedure took place on January 7, 2022 and was performed by US cardiac surgeon Bartley P. Griffith at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore.

The clinic reported January 10 with video from the operating room and a picture of the isolated pig heart. The patient had survived the typical period of a rapid rejection reaction, was conscious and reflected on his situation. He knows it's "a shot in the dark," but it's his last chance. The clinic quoted him as saying he was looking forward to getting up soon. By January 18, Bennett was off the heart-lung machine and able to communicate with those around him.

One month after the procedure, it was reported that the patient remained bedridden. Attempts were made to mobilize him with physiotherapy. A rejection reaction to the foreign organ had not materialized until then.

Two months after the transplant, Bennett died on March 8, 2022, after his health had deteriorated over a few days.

About two months after Bennett's death, doctors announced that he had been diagnosed with a swine virus. It was also said that it was possible that the virus had been the cause of death. It could also have been silent and had no effect on the patient. A combination with other factors contributing to the cause of death can also be considered.

Johann Mattheson

Johann Mattheson (28 September 1681 – 17 April 1764) was a German composer, singer, writer, lexicographer, diplomat and music theorist.

Mattheson was born on September 28, 1681 in Hamburg. His father was a tax collector. Mattheson studied many things. He learned English, French, Italian, and music. He learned to play the keyboard and write music with Johann Nicholaus Hanff. He learned to sing and play different instruments with a musician named Woldag. He played the organ when he was 9 years old.

Mattheson became interested in opera. He joined the Hamburg opera company in around 1690. He thought that he could learn more about music writing from operas. He wrote his first opera "Die Plejades" (English: "The Pleiades") in 1699. 

Mattheson met Handel in 1703. He became friends with Handel. They went to Lübeck together to apply for the position of organist at the Marienkirche. They met the composer Dietrich Buxtehude, who was the previous organist. They refused the position. This was because Buxtehude wanted the next organist to marry his daughter.

In 1704, Mattheson got in a fight with Handel. Handel did not let Mattheson replace him as a conductor in a performance. Mattheson got angry. They fought in a duel. Mattheson almost killed Handel with his sword. But Handel was saved because of a large button on his coat. They were soon reconciled.

The Hamburg opera company started to dislike Mattheson. Mattheson left the opera in 1705. He said that he had performed over 2000 performances with the opera company. In 1704, Mattheson became the teacher of Cyrill Wich. Cyrill was the son of the English ambassador to Hamburg, John Wich. Mattheson started studying English politics and history at this time. Mattheson became John Wich's secretary in 1706. He was first assigned to prepare and write reports. He traveled for diplomatic missions. He got to meet many musicians from his travels.

In 1709, Mattheson married Catharina Jennings, an Englishwoman. In 1715, Mattheson became the music director of Hamburg Cathedral. He wrote some oratorios and cantatas for the church. He left this position in 1728. He was becoming deaf. He had lost his hearing completely by 1735. In 1719, he became the Kapellmesiter in the court of Holstein. Mattheson was active from 1715 to 1740. He translated English books into German. He also wrote books about music.

Mattheson's wife died on February 3, 1753. He decided to give his money to the Michaeliskirche in Hamburg. The church was destroyed by a lightning strike in 1750. He gave his money to help rebuild the church and organ. In return, Mattheson asked to be buried on the church grounds. Mattheson died on April 17, 1763 in Hamburg. Georg Philipp Telemann conducted the funeral service. He was buried in the Michaeliskirche.

It was thought that Mattheson's music were missing since the Second World War. It turns out that his music was not destroyed. They were returned from Armenia in 1998.

Mattheson wrote books about music theory. He published a music periodical from 1722 to 1725. Mattheson included quotes from other musicians in this periodical. He often attacked other musicians in his writings. He did this without ever writing their names. He attacks older music styles in his writings. One of his most important works is "Der vollkommene Capellmeister" (English: "The Perfect "Kapellmeister""). It contains things that a "Kapellmeister" should know.

Khanty

The Khanty, or Khants, are a native population of Russia. They used to be called Ostyaks. They are an Ugrian people. They live in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug with the Mansi. In the 2010 Census, 30,943 people said they were Khanty.

In the second millennium BC, a population of people lived in land in the Kama and the Irtysh rivers. They spoke a Proto-Uralic language and had contact with Proto-Indo-European speakers from the south. Some researchers believe this is where the Khanty people came from. Other researchers say that the Khanty people came from the south Ural steppe. They were nomads, which means they didn't stay in one place for very long.

Khanty probably appear in Russian records around the 11th century, under the name Yugra. Yugra was the word for different Uralic tribes, like the Mansis. The first time the Khanty people were mentioned alone was in 1572. They were called the Ostyaks.

The Russians and Tatars colonized the Khanty. Khanty children were taken as hostages and converted to Christianity. Khanty people and other indigenous peoples were punished when they did not follow church rules. Their idols were burned, but some were secretly made again and hidden.

Some Khanty and other indigenous Siberian people fled into the tundra. The settlers were interested in the southern areas, which they could use for mining and farming. Some settlers married Khanty people and learned their language.

Khanty shamans, or spiritual leaders, were not treated well. Their burial grounds were destroyed, and Khanty children were forced to go to boarding schools. The Khanty resisted this, and elders led the Kazym rebellion. The Red Army beat the Khantys, burning their villages. Any Khanty who took part in traditional funeral rites could be put in prison, and bear hunting was no longer allowed.

Traditionally, the Khantys fished, hunted in the taiga, and herded reindeer. They lived as trappers.

During the winter, the Khanty lived in huts made out of earth and branches. During the spring, they moved towards hunting and fishing grounds, where they made tents out of birch-bark and poles, called chums. These were for temporary shelter and could be moved, but the huts in the winter were stationary, meaning they did not move. 

The Khanty used longbows, arrows and spears as weapons, and iron helmets and chain mail as armour.

The Khanty speak the Khanty language, an Uralic language. The Khanty language is related to Mansi and Hungarian.

Forex scandal

The Forex scandal is a financial scandal that involves the discovery that the some of the world's biggest currency exchange banks teamed together for at least a decade to control and rig the daily foreign exchange rates.

Market regulators in Asia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States began investigating the $5.3 trillion everyday foreign-exchange market after Bloomberg News reported in June 2013 that currency dealers said they had been front-running client orders and rigging the foreign exchange benchmark. WM/Reuters rates by colluding with counterparts and pushing through trades before and during the 60-second window when the benchmark rates are set. The behavior occurred daily in the spot foreign-exchange market and went on for at least a decade, according to currency traders. At least 11 banks including Barclays, HSBC, and Goldman Sachs disclosed investigations by regulators. Barclays, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase all suspended or placed on leave senior currency traders. Deutsche Bank, continental Europe’s largest lender, was also cooperating with requests for information from regulators.

Libor scandal

The Libor scandal was a series of fraudulent actions connected to the Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate). It affected the Interbank foreign exchange market, the trading of different banks with each other.

The Libor is an average interest rate. It is calculated when major banks in London submit their interest rates. It was discovered that banks falsely changed the interest rates before submitting them, so that they could profit from the trades. Sometimes, this also made them look more creditworthy than they really were. There is a market of about 350 trillion dollars in derivatives, which is connected to Libor. The British Bankers' Association manages the Libor. 

The banks are supposed to submit the actual interest rates they are paying, or would expect to pay, for borrowing from other banks. The Libor is supposed to be the total assessment of the health of the financial system because if the banks being polled feel confident about the state of things, they report a low number and if the member banks feel a low degree of confidence in the financial system, they report a higher interest rate number. In June 2012, multiple criminal settlements by Barclays Bank revealed significant fraud and collusion by member banks connected to the rate submissions, leading to the scandal.

An attempt to manipulate Libor is an attempt to manipulate United States derivatives markets, and thus a violation of American law. Since mortgages, student loans, financial derivatives, and other financial products often rely on Libor as a reference rate, the manipulation of submissions used to calculate those rates can have significant negative effects worldwide.

On 27 July 2012, the "Financial Times" published an article by a former trader. The article said that Libor manipulation had been common since at least 1991. Further reports on this have since come from the BBC and Reuters. On 28 November 2012, the Finance Committee of the Bundestag held a hearing to learn more about the issue.

The British Bankers’ Association said on 25 September 2012 that it would transfer oversight of Libor to United Kingdom regulators, as predicted by bank analysts, proposed by Financial Services Authority Managing Director Martin Wheatley's independent review recommendations. Wheatley's review recommended that banks submitting rates to Libor must base them on actual inter-bank deposit market transactions and keep records of those transactions, that individual banks' LIBOR submissions be published after three months, and recommended criminal sanctions specifically for manipulation of benchmark interest rates. Financial institution customers may experience higher and more volatile borrowing and hedging costs after implementation of the recommended reforms. The UK government agreed to accept all of the Wheatley Review's recommendations and press for legislation implementing them.

Significant reforms, in line with the Wheatley Review, came into effect in 2013 and a new administrator will take over in early 2014. The UK controls Libor through laws made in the UK Parliament. In particular, the Financial Services Act 2012 brings Libor under UK regulatory oversight and creates a criminal offence for knowingly or deliberately making false or misleading statements relating to benchmark-setting.

Trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson

The Trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, also known as the "Devil Made Me Do It" case, is a 1981 court case in the United States. It is the first known case in the United States in which the defense tried to prove a person was not guilty because they were possessed by a demon. They said that since the person on trial was possessed by a demon, he was not responsible for the crime. 

On November 24, 1981, in Brookfield, Connecticut, Arne Cheyenne Johnson was found guilty of first-degree manslaughter for the killing of his landlord, Alan Bono. According to testimony by the Glatzel family, 11-year-old David Glatzel had been a host to a demon. After they saw many very bad things happen that involved David, the family asked Ed and Lorraine Warren for help. They saw it as their last hope to "cure" David. The Glatzel family, with the Warrens, had many priests ask the Church to have a formal exorcism performed on David. The exorcism lasted for several days. Those people who were there said that it ended when a demon left the child's body. They said the demon moved into the body of Arne. These events were written about in the book "The Devil In Connecticut" by Gerald Brittle.

Several months after the exorcism, Arne killed his landlord during a party. His lawyer told the court that he was possessed. The judge said that this could never be proven. He said that this defense could not be used in a court of law. Arne was found guilty of the crime. He was sent to prison for 10 to 20 year but only spent 5 years in prison.

The trial attracted media attention from around the world . The case became well known because of the many depictions of the events in books and on television. The story was later made into a movie titled "" (2021).

Organ of the Basilica of St. Martin (Weingarten)

The organ at the Basilica of St. Martin (Weingarten) was built by Joseph Gabler from 1737 to 1750. 

Joseph Gabler signed the first contract on July 6, 1737. The organ needed to have four manuals (keyboards), a pedalboard, sixty stops, and some accessory stops. According to his contracts, the organ is supposed to have 6,666 pipes. 6,666 is traditionally the number of lashes Jesus received. This number of pipes was never reached.

In 1737, a fire destroyed the abbey. It became more important to rebuild the abbey. This delayed the construction of the organ. Gabler was given another job to build a smaller organ. The main organ was finished in 1750. It was blessed on June 24, 1750.

From 1981 to 1983, Orgelbau Kuhn AG (Männendorf on lake Zurich) made changes to the organ. They returned the organ to how it was in 1750. They extended the playing range of the pedal. They changed the temperament of the organ.

Gabler built the organ in the western gallery of the church. The organ does not cover the windows of the gallery. The console of the organ (the place where the organist plays the organ) is detached from the organ.

The organ has several effect stops. The "Carillon" is a stop which plays chimes in the organ. The pedal chimes are placed above the organ. They are arranged like bundles of grapes.

There is a legend about the organ's "vox humana" stop. Gabler tried to make a pipe which sounds like the human voice. He tried different types of woods and metals. But nothing worked. One night, the devil promised Gabler that he would help him. In return, Gabler had to give up his soul. He exchanged his soul for a piece of metal. He used this metal to make the "vox humana" pipes. The pipes worked. They sounded like the human voice. However, the monks in the abbey soon noticed. Gabler was put on trial. He confessed to his crimes. He was sentenced to be burned at the stake. However, Gabler has to make a replacement of the "vox humana" pipes. His replacements were so good that the monks did not execute him.

Desert Fathers

Desert Fathers is the name for early Christian monks, who left the villages of Egypt, when Christans were persecuted under Diocletian. They then either lived alone, as hermits, or they formed small groups who lived in monasteries. The settled in the desert. in Egypt and Syria. Most of them went to the Scetes desert, about south of Alexandria. The most well-known of their monasteries are located in Wadi El Natrun, Nitria and Kellia. The movement started in the 3rd century. The is a collection of the wisdom of some of the early desert monks and nuns, in print as "Sayings of the Desert Fathers". The most well known was Anthony the Great, who moved to the desert in AD 270–271 and became known as both the father and founder of desert monasticism. By the time Anthony had died in AD 356, thousands of monks and nuns had been drawn to living in the desert following Anthony's example, leading his biographer, Athanasius of Alexandria, to write that "the desert had become a city." The Desert Fathers had a major influence on the development of Christianity.

The desert monastic communities that grew out of the informal gathering of hermit monks became the model for Christian monasticism. The eastern monastic tradition at Mount Athos and the western Rule of St Benedict both were strongly influenced by the traditions that began in the desert. All of the monastic revivals of the Middle Ages looked to the desert for inspiration and guidance. Much of Eastern Christian spirituality, including the Hesychast movement, had its roots in the practices of the Desert Fathers. Even religious renewals such as the German evangelicals and Pietists in Pennsylvania, the movement, and the Methodist Revival in England are seen by modern scholars as being influenced by the Desert Fathers.

His full name is revealed in the foreword to the 1951 book "Henry the Green Engine". He also appears in the television series "Thomas and Friends", adapted from the books, and also its reboot, "".

The character is first seen in "The Sad Story of Henry" in the first book in the "Railway Series", "The Three Railway Engines". When Henry refused to leave a tunnel, the story says that "A fat director, who was on the train, told the guard to get a rope". The character is referred to as The Fat Controller from the third book, "James the Red Engine," for the remainder of the "Railway Series," due to the nationalisation of British Railways.

White phosphorous bomb

White phosphoros bombs use one of the allotropes of phosphorous. They are used as incendiary weapons. White phosphorous is very reactive, and will ignite, when it comes in contact with the oxygen in the air. It will burn with a white flame, and heat up to . Burning white phosproous will also produce a lot of toxic white smoke. While the fire can be extingished with water, the phosphorous will soon re-ignite. For this reason, sand should be used to extinguish it.

Anyone coming in contact will suffer third-degree burns, and wounds which will take a very long time to heal. If they are not treated soon, injured people will die a slow and painful death. 

The UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons of 1980 prohibits the use of weapons which cause a lot of injury or whose effects are indiscriminate. This means that white phosphorous ammunition is banned under this converion. Some people think that because it is highly toxic, white phosphorous bombs may be a chemical weapon. This means that they would be banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Immurement

Immurement (from Latin "immurus", meaning " wall in" or "enwall"), immuration or live entombment is a historical form of imprisonment, generally until death, in which someone is/was placed in an enclosed space with the opening walled off. Immurement has been used as a punishment and as a form of human sacrifice. As a punishment, live entombment was largely used on members of clergy (monks, nuns and ancient Rome's Vestal Virgins for example) and others whose blood was not allowed to be spilled according to custom and or law. Also in Mongolia, women who were accused of adultery were often immured in crates which had a holes for the head and one arm to poke through. The latest documented case of immurement as a form of execution occurred in 1906 in Morocco. The one walled up in this case was a Serial killer named Mohammed Mesfewi who was originally sentenced to crucifixion before foreign dignitaries talked the Moroccan government out of crucifying Mohammed. As a form of human sacrifice, live entombment was intended to ensure that buildings and bridges remained standing. It was thought that immuring living people in this manner would bring good luck to the structure. The song <nowiki>"London Bridge is Falling Down"</nowiki> may be about such sacrificial entombment. Usually the entombed victim would be left to dehydrate and starve to death, but sometimes they were fed regularly. In the latter case, immurement was more life imprisonment than a form of execution. There have been historical and fictional accounts of people being walled in alive. One story of fictional immuration is in the story The Cask of Armontillado by Edgar Allen Poe.


Selkup people

The Selkup (Russian: селькупы) people are a native population of Russia. They come from northern West Siberia. They are a Samoyedic people. They used to be called Ostyak-Samoyeds (остяко-самоеды). They live in the northern parts of Tomsk Oblast, Krasnoyarsk Krai and Tyumen Oblast (with Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug).

Selkups speak the Selkup language. It is part of the Samoyedic languages, which is a group of Uralic languages.

The Selkups came from the middle basin of the Ob River. They came from the Yeniseian and Samoyedic peoples, who moved to that region from the Sayan Mountains.

The first time Selkups appeared in Russian records was in 1246.

Turkic-Tatars ruled the Selkups and other Southern Samoyed people in the 13th century. Russians took over and ruled the Selkups by 1628. Some Selkups began to move to the Taz River and Turukhan River. They hunted, fished, and bred reindeer. They had a hard time breeding reindeer when Russian settlers started hunting them too. The Selkups tried to fight against the Russians, but they were defeated.

In the 18th century, Selkups were given Russian names. They were also forced to convert to Christianity. They went through Russification, which means they were forced to give up their traditional culture and be more like Russians. In the 1930s, Selkup people were forced to settle, and their children were sent to boarding schools. Today, they suffer from racial discrimination, unemployment and alcohol abuse.

In 2002, 4,249 Selkups lived in Russia. In 2010, 3,649 Selkups lived in Russia.

In 2002, Meilin "Mei" Lee is a 13 year-old Chinese-Canadian girl who lives in Toronto. Mei helps take care of the Lee family's temple to their ancestor, Sun Yee. She works to make her strict, overprotective mother, Ming, proud. She tries to hide her personal interests from Ming, such as her crushes on boys and that she and her best friends Miriam, Priya, and Abby are fans of the boy band 4*Town.

After having a nightmare, Mei suddenly wakes up to discover that she has turned into a large red panda. After hiding it from her parents, Mei discovers that she only transforms when she has high emotions. At first her parents believe her problem is caused by her first period. Later, Ming finds out the truth when she embarrasses Mei at school, causing her to transform into a red panda.

Ming and Jin, Mei's father, explain that Sun Yee (an ancestor) was granted the ability to transform into a red panda in order to fight battles, and every female member of the family since has gained the ability when they get old enough. This has become inconvenient and dangerous, so the red panda spirit must be sealed in a talisman by a ritual on the night of the Red Moon, in a month's time. Mei's friends discover her transformation but like it, and Mei finds that concentrating on her friends prevents her from transforming. She convinces her parents to let her continue her normal life. Ming continues to keep a close eye on Mei.

4*Town announces a show in Toronto as part of their concert tour, but Ming refuses to let Mei attend it. Using her red panda form, Mei and her friends begin to secretly raise money for the tickets. Tyler, a former bully, blackmails Mei to entertain people at his birthday party. At the party, Mei discovers that the concert will be on the night of the ritual. She gets angry and attacks Tyler when he insults her, scaring the other kids. Ming discovers Mei's recent activities and scolds her friends for corrupting and taking advantage of her. Mei fails to come to her friends' defense because she is ashamed and afraid to stand up to Ming.

Mei's grandmother Wu and her aunts come to assist in her ritual, but just as the red panda form is about to be sealed, Mei decides to keep her powers. She abandons the ritual to attend the concert at the SkyDome with her friends. They forgive Mei for her actions at the party and discover that Tyler is also a fan of 4*Town. However, during her escape from the temple, Mei inadvertently damaged her mother's talisman; an enraged Ming transforms into a "kaiju"-size red panda and disrupts the concert, intending to take Mei by force. While the audience scatters, Mei and Ming argue about Mei's independence, and Mei accidentally knocks her mother out.

The rest of the Lee family arrive to help. All the women break their talismans to use their red panda forms to help bring Ming into a new ritual circle. With the singing of Mei's friends and 4*Town, the new ritual sends Mei, Ming, and the other women to the astral world. Mei resolves with Ming and helps Ming to fix her bond with Wu which had started Ming's perfectionism. The other Lee women conceal their red pandas in new talismans, but Mei decides to keep hers, as she is finally figuring out who she wants to be.

Some time later, Mei and Ming's relationship has improved and Mei balances her temple jobs with spending time with friends, now including Tyler.

All military and security forces are under the command of the president of Ukraine. This includes the Armed Forces. They are subject to oversight by a parliamentary commission.

It is a part of the Border Guard Service. It is not a part of the navy.

Because of the Russian military intervention in Ukraine in 2014, the president had the leaders of oblasts of Ukraine create units which are made up of volunteers. These groups are under the control of the government's Territorial Defense Forces. At first, the government gave these units very little money. Most of their funding came from donations.

After the fighting with Russia in 2014, Ukraine increased the size of its armed forces to 204,000 soldiers.

In 2022, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered that the size of the military would be increased by 100,000 by 2025. He also ordered that conscription would end in 2024. Conscription will be replaced with short-term military training.

Pelle Svanslös (movie)

Peter-No-Tail () is a 1981 Swedish animated film based on the children's book series by Gösta Knutsson.
On a Swedish country farm, a cat gives birth to a litter of kittens. One of these cats do not have a tail. The farmer is ordered by the farm owner to get rid of the kitten without the tail. He smuggles the young cat into the car of a family returning to Uppsala after a holiday near the farm. Discovered on arrival at the family's home, the stowaway is named Peter-No-Tail (Pelle Svanslös) by the children Olle and Birgitta. Peter soon settles into his new home, but when Birgitta takes him out for a walk in the following spring, he is chased by a vicious bulldog, and escapes to a town alley where Elaka Måns (Mean Mike) lives. The long-tailed Måns, aided by twins Bill and Bull, is a notorious bully amongst the town cats, so he tricks the naïve Peter into singing outside the home of a young female cat named Maja Gräddnos (Molly Cream-Nose). Maja's human owners hate cat howling, so Måns expects Peter to be soaked with water in his attempt to impress Maja. But Maja is attracted to the polite and kind-hearted Peter, so she invites him in to share some fish with her; thus it is Måns who ends up getting soaked with a garden hose when he tries to impress Maja himself. At the town cats' spring ball, Måns organises a competition where contestants must answer a mental arithmetic question by showing the winning number with their tails. Peter is given an impossibly hard sum, and the other cats mock him for not having a tail at all to even guess the answer. But a snake that Peter befriended earlier reveals the correct answer, and also bites Måns' long tail, humiliating him in front of the crowd. In revenge, Måns breaks into Peter's home and frames him for eating Olle's birthday cake, so the family locks Peter in the ironing room as punishment. However, when a fire breaks out in the house at night, Peter wakes and alerts the sleeping family with his frantic meowing, so he is redeemed as a hero, and Birgitta gives him a medal for his bravery. When Måns learns of Peter's good deed, he dismisses his medal as worthless, and invents a new sports event called the Cat Championship, where the winning prize is a gold medallion. The challenges include a distance jump, throwing shotput balls, and a hurdle race course. Måns stages each of the challenges so that Peter fails - his spike shoes for the distance jump have the spikes on the inside to hurt his feet, Peter's shotput ball is far heavier than the others, and Måns cheats in the hurdle race to make sure he wins. But when Måns' tricks are discovered, the referee disqualifies him and awards Peter the gold medallion instead. Maja, who has been cheering Peter on throughout the tournament, congratulates him and they celebrate his victory together. Now eager to get rid of Peter, Måns tries to rally his fellow cats into opposing 'country' cats, and he sets loose the dangerous bulldog to chase Peter out of the city. Most of the town cats watch from safety in the trees, but a kitten named Fridolf has strayed onto some high scaffolding platforms, where he is attacked by the bulldog. Peter rescues Fridolf from the collapsing scaffolding and escapes from the savage bulldog, who subsequently chases Måns, Bill and Bull away instead. For saving Fridolf, the town cats praise Peter and finally accept him into their community. At the end of the film, Peter's family take him with them on their next summer holiday, returning to the farm where Peter was born.
The film is animated and is based on the children's book series by Gösta Knutsson. Class discrimination, bullying and racism play a big part of the story, much like in the books since Peter is at times looked down on for being a "country cat", who is accused by Måns of threatening the livelihoods of the town cats. In the original Swedish dub Måns is played by Ernst-Hugo Järegård.

A sequel called "Peter-No-Tail in Americat" () was released in 1985.


Pelle Svanslös i Amerikatt (movie)

Peter-No-Tail in Americat () is a 1985 Swedish animation based on stories about the tail-less cat "Pelle Svanslös" by Gösta Knutsson. The cartoon is a sequel to the 1981 cartoon "Peter-No-Tail". It is known in Sweden for its extremely surreal content.

Peter-No-Tail (Pelle Svanslös) is a cat without a tail. He was bit off by a rat when he was a kitten. He compensates for this by studying hard. Much to the dismay of his arch-rival Magnus (Måns), he earns a high university degree that few cats in the university town of Uppsala, Sweden, have got. In the movie, he is visited by his American relative Pelle Swanson. He invites him to visit his new home country, the United States, in the movie called "Americat". There everything is bigger; even the rats are much fatter.
The movie is mainly about what happens to someone from another country who is not used to the life in a big city. Nevertheless, Peter-No-Tail is still a kindhearted cat to everyone, even if the other cats are not nice to him. Everything seems possible in America, even the prospect of finally having a proper tail and a sweetheart to call one's own.
The movie has many surreal elements. When Peter encounters large ghetto-rats that try to eat him, the famous church of Uppsala turning into a huge cat, and a Native American cat that uses magic to give him a long, golden tail, earning him the nickname of "Peter Gold-Tail."

1998 Russian financial crisis

The Russian financial crisis (also called "Ruble crisis" or the "Russian Flu") hit Russia on 17 August 1998. It made the Russian government devaluing the ruble and defaulting on its debt.
On 17 August 1998, the Russian government devalued the ruble. They also defaulted on domestic debt and declared a
moratorium on payments to foreign creditors.

On 17 August 1998 the government declared in the Joint Statement of the Government of the Russian Federation and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation that the state securities (GKOs and OFZs), with due dates through 31 December 1999, would be changed into new securities. The terms of the GKO/OFZ restructuring were also determined in the following acts:


The financial crisis spread panic throughout the world financial system.
The Russian crisis affected Baltic countries more than expected. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania sank into recession. Figures for 1999 showed a heavy decline in exports from these countries to Russia, in addition to a big decline in growth rates of these economies. Foods and beverages have suffered the most.
Overall, economic activity slowed down due to the Russian crisis. Output growth has fallen from about 8.5 percent in 1998 to 3.4 percent in 1999. Both exports and imports contracted substantially, resulting in a drop in the current account deficit from a 6.1 percent GDP in 1998 to 2.2 percent in 1999. 

Externally, exports to Russia, which was more than 60 percent of total exports, fell during the second half of 1998 by 10 percent. Demand for Belarusian products was weak through 1999, showing signs of recovery only during the final quarter, with the revival of economic activity in Russia. Also, in the first quarter of 1999, compared to 1998, except for investments, all budget expenditures were smaller. The biggest cuts were made in national security (a 1.9 GDP, compared to 2.5 percent in the first quarter of 1998) and social policy (1.5 and 2.4 percent of GDP, respectively) where expenditures were lowered almost by one third.
The Russian crisis was a hard blow to the Kazakh economy. Kazakhstan lost its pricing competitiveness and its exports were in shambles. On the other hand, cheap Russian goods were coming into here. This killed domestic industries. There was huge pressure on the tenge, the Kazakh currency, and Kazakhstan's balance of payments worsened. However, the NBK continued to keep the value of the tenge. In fact, they had spent close to a billion dollars to keep the level of tenge. Their foreign exchange reserves halved.
Moldova got an IMF special mission advising the government. This was about how to cope with the effects of the Russian crisis. At that time Russia bought 85% of Moldova's wine and brandy, as well as most of its canned goods and tobacco. After the ruble crashed, most Russian importers put deals with Moldova on hold. Moldovan president Petru Lucinschi was quoted as saying that the Russian crisis had cost Moldova as much as five per cent of its GDP. The country's parliament was discussing a program to reduce imports and find new markets outside Russia.
The crisis cost the Ukraine a lot as well: the Hryvnia devaluated by 60%, domestic prices increased by 20%. The National Bank of Ukraine lost 40% of its gross reserves.
The U.S. stock market began to slip in early August 1998. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 984 points, or 11.5%, in 3 days at the end of August, to a level 19% below its July peak. This more than erased the year's market gains. The U.S. stock market remained depressed until October, when a series of interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve propelled it back upward.
The government banned free unlicensed sales of food. Most of them are imported from Russia. The ban aimed to stop prices rising.

1997 Asian financial crisis

The Asian financial crisis was a period of financial crisis. It gripped much of Asia beginning in July 1997.

Currency pegs and fixed exchange rates: Many Asian countries, including Thailand, South Korea, and Indonesia, had fixed exchange rate regimes or money pegs to the U.S. dollar. This made their currencies vulnerable to speculative attack.

 Rapid capital inflows and excessive borrowing: Asian economies experienced a surge in capital inflows and relied heavily on foreign borrowing, leading to over-investment and unsustainable levels of debt 

 Weak financial systems and corporate governance: short financial regulations, weak banking sectors, and poor corporate governance practices exacerbated the vulnerabilities in the affected economies 

Money reduction: Many Asian currencies experienced significant devaluations, leading to a sharp decline in the value of assets and increased debt burdens for companies with foreign currency liabilities 

 Financial sector failures: Banks and financial institutions faced insolvency and encountered difficulties in meeting their duty, contributing to a severe banking crisis in the region 

 Economic contraction and social impact: The crisis resulted in severe economic contractions, rising unemployment, and social hardships, including increased poverty rates and social unrest in some countries 

International Monetary Fund (IMF) assistance and conditionality: The IMF provided financial assistance to the affected countries, often in exchange for implementing structural reforms, fiscal austerity measures, and financial sector reforms

Táin Bó Cúailnge

The Táin Bó Cúailnge ("The Cattle Raid of Cooley") is an ancient Irish story. It is part of a group of stories, the Ulster Cycle or Cuchulain cycle. Ulster is a place in northern Ireland where most of the story happens. Cuchulain is the main hero of the story. According to Professor John Dunn of Catholic University, who wrote an English translation in 1914, the Tain is the Iliad of Ireland.

The "Tain" is the oldest vernacular story in western Europe, meaning the oldest story told in the language that people really spoke (instead of in Latin).

The story was passed down by people telling it out loud, so it may have changed many times. The oldest version of the "Tain" that to be written down is the "Lebor na hUidre" or "Book of the Dun Cow". People at Clonmacnoise wrote it down in the 1100s c.e.

In ancient Ireland, cows were very important. Many of the stories people told were about catching or stealing cows from other people. According to a book written in 1088 c.e., the real-life King Conchobor, who is the king in the Tain, became king of Ireland in 30 c.e.

In part of Ireland called Connacht, Queen Medb and King Ailil joke about which one of them is richer. They look at all their wealth to compare it, from the most valuable gold to the commonest cloth. They find they have almost exactly the same amount. Except King Ailil has one very good bull called Finnbeach ("White-horned"). Queen Medb is sad and disappointed. Then she hears there is a bull as good as Finnbeach nearby in Cúailnge, called Donn Cualnge ("Brown bull of Culange"). She sends her messenger Mac Roth, to the bull's owner and asks to rent it for a year. The owner agrees. But later that night, Medb's men boast that, if the owner had said no, Medb would have sent her army to take the bull by force. This makes the owner angry, and he sends the messenegers away without the bull.

Medb and Ailil take their army into to capture the bull.

The men of Ulster cannot fight back. In an earlier part of the Ulster Cycle, a goddess put a curse on them. For five days every year, warriors born in Ulster feel like they are giving birth to babies. Because of the pain, they cannot fight. However, one warrior was not born in Ulster: Cuchullain.

Cuchullain goes to Medb's army alone. At night, he attacks the sleeping soldiers with his slingshot, killing many. The next day, he makes a deal with Medb's army: They choose one warrior to fight him in one man against one man. If they do this, Cuchullain will not attack them at night. If Cuchullain wins, the army must stay still until the next day. If the other fighter wins, Cuchullain will die.

Medb agrees, saying that it is better to lose one warrior a day than twenty at night. To convince men to fight Cuchullain, Medb promises that anyone who kills him can marry her beautiful daughter, Finnabair. One of the men Medb sends is Cuchullain's foster-father, Fergus. Another is Cuchullain's foster brother and best friend, Ferdiad.

In this way, Cuchullain slows Medb's army almost until King Conchobor and the rest of the warriors feel better. Medb and her army capture many cows and women. Then the two armies fight.

The Ulster Army wins. Then Finnbeach and Dunn Culagne fight too. Dun Culagne wins, and parts of Finnbeach's organs are stuck on his horns. He walks down the river and some of the organs fall off. Different places on the river are named after where the organs fell off the horns.

Later writers read or heard about the "Tain" and it affected their own work. For example, it affected W.B. Yeats, Lady Augusta Gregory, Seamus Heaney, and Frank McCourt.

Hatcher Pass

Hatcher Pass (3,886 ft or 1,148 m) is a mountain pass through the southwest part of the Talkeetna Mountains, Alaska with a 60 mile scenic road between Palmer, Alaska and Willow, Alaska. Hatcher Pass is the location of the Independence Mine State Historic Park.

Hatcher Pass was discovered in 1906 by Robert Lee Hatcher. Hatcher found gold in Hatcher Pass and opened the way for mining. Mining companies worked together to help offset the costs as lode mining was expensive. However in 1942, World War II began and gold mining was not needed for war. By 1943, Independence Mine shut down. In 1974, Independence Mine was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In November 1957, a B-29 crashed into Bomber Glacier. This is how Bomber Glacier and Bomber Pass got their names. Although the wreckage is there for hikers to see, the trip is hard. Those who make the trip need proper tools to be safe. 

Hatcher Pass is mostly known for the historic Independence Mine. There are also about 16 other mines spread throughout the Pass. Hatcher Pass also has log cabins that can be rented by visitors year round. Hatcher Pass Lodge has the only restaurant in the pass. Throughout the area, hikers can find old cabins that miners lived in.

Hatcher Pass is 60 miles from downtown Anchorage, Alaska. Hatcher Pass is located at the low ridge of the Talkeetna Mountains. Hatcher Pass is closest to the city of Palmer Alaska, 20 miles to the north. The city of Willow Alaska which is 30 miles to the west. Hatcher Pass is 301,210 acres and the road stretches 60 miles long.

Many types of plant life native to Alaska grow in Hatcher Pass. These include Alaska blueberries, Jacob's ladder, cattail, Devil's club, fireweed, forget-me-not, highbush and lowbush cranberry, and salmonberry. Some trees such as Red Alder, Black Cottonwood and White Spruce also grow there.

Animals such as Arctic ground squirrels, red foxes, minks, American black bears, brown bears, caribou, and Moose are native to Hatcher Pass.


There are at least 17 sources of water throughout Hatcher Pass. The largest is the Little Susitna river.

Hatcher Pass is known for having a variety of hiking trails. The trails range from novice, moderate, and difficult. Some areas are recommended for experts only.  


Hatcher Pass offers areas for camping and cabin rentals. The alpine meadows are friendly locations for picnics. Gold panning can still be done in the creeks and rivers. In winter, sledding, skiing, and snowboarding are common winter activities. As of 2020, the state gave Salmonberry Tours the job of managing visitors. Tour companies often give guided tours with guides from the state park management.

Later, a definnition based on nodes was created for Trechnotheria. This clade was imcluded the last common ancestor of "Zhangheotherium" and living therian mammals and all of its descentants.

Like most mammal groups from the Mesozoic Era, early trechnotherians are known mainly from their teeth. One of the features of this group which is the most noticable is their large teeth. The features of the shoulder blade, tibia, humerus, and ankle joint are also used to define which animals are in this clade.

All presidential contestants challenging Tokayev were described as "pocket candidates", because of their lack of popularity and obscurity.



Gabriel Lippmann

Jonas Ferdinand Gabriel Lippmann (16 August 1845 – 13 July 1921) was a Franco-Luxembourgish physicist and inventor. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on color photography.

Gabriel Lippmann was born in Bonnevoie, Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: Bouneweg), on 16 August 1845. At that time, Bonnevoie was part of the commune of Hollerich. Bonnevoie is now a district of Luxembourg City.) His father, Isaïe was a French Jew. He managed the family glove-making business. In 1848, the family moved to Paris. At first, Lippmann was tutored by his mother, Miriam Rose (Lévy). He later studied at the Lycée Napoléon (now Lycée Henri-IV). In school, Lippmann did not do well at paying attention. He did have a special interest in mathematics. In 1868, he was admitted to the École normale supérieure in Paris, In 1872, the French government sent him to Heidelberg University. He was able to specialize in electricity Lippmann receiving a doctorate with "summa cum laude" distinction in 1874. Lippmann then returned to Paris in 1875. he continued to study until 1878. He then became professor of physics at the Sorbonne.

Lippmann made important contributions to different areas of physics.

One of Lippmann's early discoveries was the relationship between electrical and capillary phenomena. This let him create a sensitive capillary electrometer. It became known as the Lippmann electrometer. This device was used in the first ECG machine. 

In 1881, Lippmann predicted the converse piezoelectric effect.

Lippmann is remembered as the inventor of a way to reproducing colors by photography. It is based on the interference phenomenon. This work earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1908.

In 1886, Lippmann's interest turned to a method of creating the colors of the solar spectrum on a photographic plate. On 2 February 1891, he told the Academy of Sciences: "I have succeeded in obtaining the image of the spectrum with its colors on a photographic plate whereby the image remains fixed and can remain in daylight without deterioration." By April 1892, he said that he had succeeded in creating color images of a stained glass window, a group of flags, a bowl of oranges topped by a red poppy and a colorful parrot. 

The interference phenomenon in optics is a result of the wave propagation of light. When light of a given wavelength is reflected at itself by a mirror, standing waves are created. This is similar to the ripples that are caused when a stone is dropped into water. A standing waves is created when the waves are reflected back at themselves by a surface such as the wall of a pool. In the case of normal incoherent light, the standing waves can only be seen in an extremely small area of space next to the reflecting surface.

Lippmann projected an image onto a special photographic plate. The plate was able to record details smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. The light passed through a glass sheet into a very thin and almost transparent photographic emulsion. The emulsion containing extremely small silver halide grains. A temporary mirror of liquid mercury reflected the light back through the emulsion/ This created standing waves. The nodes almost no effect but their antinodes created an image. After development, the result was distinct parallel layers made up of submicroscopic metallic silver grains. These layers were a permanent record of the standing waves. In each part of the image, the spacing of the layers corresponded to the half-wavelengths of the light photographed.

Light was shone on the finished plate at a nearly perpendicular angle. Daylight or another source of white light was used. At each point on the plate, light of the same wavelength as the light which had created the layers was reflected back toward the viewer. Light of other wavelengths passed through the emulsion. The wavelengths (colors) of the light which had formed the original image created a full-color image.

In practice, the Lippmann process was not easy to use. Higher resolution needed smaller grains. Smaller grains were less affected by light so they needed to be exposed to the light for a longer amount of time. With a lens with a large opening and a very brightly sunlit subject, a camera exposure of less than one minute were rare. Exposures measured in minutes were normal. Pure colors photographed well, but the colors of real-world objects could be a problem to photograph. The process could not make color prints on paper. It was not possible to make a good copy of a Lippmann color photograph by rephotographing it. The requirements needed to see the colors to best effect meant the photographs could not be used for casual use. 

Lippmann also invented the coelostat. It is a tool used in astronem that compensated for the rotation of the Earth. This lets people photograph areas of the sky without apparent movement.
Lippmann married the daughter of the writer Victor Cherbuliez in 1888. He died on 13 July 1921 aboard the steamer "France" after leaving Canada.

Mahogany tree frog

The mahogany tree frog or loquacious tree frog ("Tlalocohyla loquax") is a frog that lives in Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.

This frog lives in places where there is water in the air. Scientists have seen it 1000 meters above sea level and below.

The adult male frog is 33 to 45 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 38 to 47 mm long. This frog has bright yellow color on its back. It has bright red near its rear end and sides. This frog can change color. It shows its yellow and orange at night. During the day, it is almost white. This frog looks for food at night. The front feet and back feet have webbing on them.

This frog lays eggs in deep bodies of water. The female lays about 250 eggs at a time. The eggs stick to plants on the surface. After the tadpoles hatch, they swim to the deepest water.

This frog is not in danger of dying out because it can live in many places where the water is deep so long as there are some plants. Many of the places where the frog lives are in protected areas where the government does not allow humans to build things.

Battle of Brovary

The Battle of Brovary was a battle that started on 9 March 2022. It was a part of the Kyiv offensive during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The battle took place near the city of Brovary. Brovary is to the east of the capital city of Ukraine, Kyiv.

On the evening of 9 March, Russian armoured vehicles were coming towards Brovary on the Highway M01. The armoured vehicles were the 6th and 239th Tank Regiments of the 90th Guards Tank Division. They were going very slowly. Some of them were very old vehicles, like T-72 tanks which were designed 49 years before the battle. They are not very good and are outdated. Also, in the front of the group of vehicles were TOS-1s. They were very vulnerable. Ukrainian forces saw this and attacked. They disabled the tanks and armored personnel carriers. The Russians retreated. This is because they had lost a large amount of soldiers and equipment. The Russian commander, Andrei Zakharov, was killed in the battle.

On 12 March, Russia said that its troops disabled the Ukrainian military's main centre for communications and intelligence that were in Brovary. The mayor of Brovary, Ihor Sapozhko, however said, "We are ready for them."

2022 Zhytomyr attacks

The Zhytomyr attack was an attack on the airport of Zhytomyr against civilians. It was on on 27 February 2022. It was a part of the Kyiv offensive of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The airport was from the capital city of Ukraine, Kyiv. It was near the town of Zhytomyr, Zhytomyr Oblast. Russia used 9K720 Iskander missiles that were from in Belarus. Attacks on the city were afterwards in March.

On March 1 late in the evening, Russian troops hit a residential part of the city. 10 buildings on the Shukhevych street were damaged. A hospital was also damaged. A few bombs were dropped. At least two civilian Ukrainians were killed. Three were injured.

On March 2, shells hit a regional perinatal center. Some private houses were also hit.

On March 4, rockets hit the 25th Zhytomyr school. Half of it was destroyed. Later that evening, the "Ozerne and Zhytomyr Armored Plant" was under fire. Two people were injured.

On March 8, a dormitory was hit after an airstrike. The Isovat factory was damaged.

On March 9, the city Ozerne district went under fire. It was on the very outside of the city.

The first few thousand minor planets have all been named. The near-Earth asteroid (4596) 1981 QB is the lowest-numbered unnamed minor planet. The first 3 pages in the table contain 1,000 named entries each. The first 13 and 33 pages contain at least 500 and 100 named entries each. The first range to contain no entries is . There are also many name conflicts with other astronomical objects. The name conflicts are usually with with planetary satellites. 

After the discovering astronomer discovers a planet, they can ask for that planet to be named a specific way. New minor planet names are approved and published by IAU's WGSBN many times every year. The WGSBN has a set of rules for naming minor planets. These are from syntax restrictions to non-offensive meanings. Over the years the rules have changed many times. In the beginning, for example, most minor planets were named after female characters from Greek and Roman mythology.

This is a list of all partial lists on the meanings of minor planets (MoMP). Each table has 100,000 minor planets. Each cell is a list of 1,000 numbered minor planets in order. Grayed out cells do not yet have any named minor planets. For an introduction, "see ".

Bipalium

Bipalium is a genus of large predatory land planarians. They are often called "hammerhead worms" or "broadhead planarians" because of their head shape. Several species are considered as invasive to the United States and Europe. Some studies have been done on the evolution and ecology in these planarians.

The name "Bipalium" comes from Latin "bi-", “two” + "pala", “shovel” or “spade”. This is because their heads look like a pickaxe.

The genus "Bipalium" currently has the following species:
"Bipalium" species are predatory. Some species eat earthworms. Others eat mollusks. These flatworms can track their prey. When they eat earthworms, they begin to react to the attack. The flatworm then uses the muscles in its body to attach itself to the earthworm to make it so it can't escape.

Reproduction in "Bipalium" may be asexual or sexual. All species are hermaphroditic.

"B. adventitium" reproduces sexually. They make egg capsules which hatch about 3 weeks later. The egg capsules have a tough outside. They usually have multiple children.

"B. kewense" sometimes are seen using egg capsules as a primary method of reproduction. Asexual reproduction is its main reproductive strategy in temperate climates. Many of them never get sexual organs. Children of this species aren't the same colors as their parents when they are young. This is unlike other species.

In 2014, tetrodotoxin, a very dangerous neurotoxin, was found in "B. adventitium" and "B. kewense". It is the first record of tetrodotoxin in terrestrial invertebrates.

Ferenc Gyurcsány

Ferenc Gyurcsány (born 4 June 1961) is a Hungarian politician who served as the Prime Minister of Hungary from 2004 to 2009. He is a member of the Hungarian Socialist Party and was elected to parliament in 2002.

Gyurcsány was born on June 4, 1961, in Pápa, Hungary. He studied economics at the Budapest University of Economics and later earned a PhD in the same field from the University of Pécs.

Gyurcsány began his political career in the early 1990s, when he was appointed as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of a state-owned construction company. He later became involved in the leadership of the MSZP and was elected to parliament in 2002.

In 2004, Gyurcsány was elected as Prime Minister of Hungary after his party won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections. His government pursued a program of economic and social reforms aimed at reducing Hungary's budget deficit and promoting growth.

Gyurcsány's government introduced a number of measures aimed at improving Hungary's fiscal position and stimulating economic growth. These measures included the introduction of a flat tax system, the privatization of state-owned enterprises, and the reform of the pension system.

Gyurcsány's government faced several challenges during its time in power, including a series of corruption scandals and accusations of economic mismanagement. In 2006, Gyurcsány was caught on tape admitting that his government had lied to the public about the state of Hungary's economy in the run-up to the 2006 elections.

The tape sparked widespread protests and calls for Gyurcsány's resignation. However, he refused to step down and instead called for a referendum on his government's economic policies. The referendum was unsuccessful, and Gyurcsány remained in power until 2009, when his party was defeated in the parliamentary elections.

Following his resignation as Prime Minister, Gyurcsány remained active in politics and founded a new political party, the Democratic Coalition, in 2011. The party has since become a prominent opposition force in Hungarian politics, advocating for progressive economic policies and democratic values.

Overall, Gyurcsány is a controversial figure in Hungarian politics, with some viewing him as a competent and committed leader, while others criticize him for his role in the economic and political turmoil that characterized his time as Prime Minister. Nonetheless, he remains an influential figure in the Hungarian political landscape and continues to advocate for reform and democratic values.

Ferenc Gyurcsány is a Hungarian businessman and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Hungary from 2004 to 2009. He was born on June 4, 1961, in Pápa, Hungary. He grew up in a working-class family, and his father was a factory worker. Gyurcsány attended the University of Pécs, where he studied economics and later pursued further studies in the United States. He began his career in business, starting his own company before entering politics in the early 2000s.

After stepping down as Prime Minister of Hungary in 2009, Ferenc Gyurcsány returned to politics in 2010. He founded the Democratic Coalition (DK), a center-left political party, and was elected as its leader. In the 2014 European Parliament elections, DK won two seats, and Gyurcsány became a Member of the European Parliament. He has been a vocal critic of the current Hungarian government and has been involved in various protests and demonstrations against Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's administration. Gyurcsány has been a prominent figure in Hungarian politics, and his return to the political arena has reinvigorated the opposition movement.

Ferenc Gyurcsány served as the Prime Minister of Hungary from 2004 to 2009. During his tenure, he implemented several economic and social reforms, including the introduction of a flat tax system and the expansion of healthcare coverage. His government also pursued a pro-European Union and pro-Atlantic foreign policy, and Hungary joined the Schengen Area during his time in office. However, his administration was marred by several controversies, including the leaking of a speech in which he admitted to lying about the state of Hungary's economy in order to win the 2006 election. The speech sparked widespread protests and calls for his resignation, and his popularity plummeted. He resigned in 2009, and his party, the Hungarian Socialist Party, was soundly defeated in the subsequent election.

After stepping down as Prime Minister of Hungary in 2009, Ferenc Gyurcsány has remained active in politics and business. He founded the Democratic Coalition (DK), a center-left political party, and has been a vocal critic of the current Hungarian government led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Gyurcsány has been involved in various protests and demonstrations against the Orbán administration and has been a key figure in the opposition movement. In addition to his political work, he has also been involved in business, serving as the CEO of Altus Zrt., an investment company. Gyurcsány's continued involvement in Hungarian politics and business has made him one of the most prominent and influential figures in the country.

Ferenc Gyurcsány was born on June 4, 1961, in Pápa, Hungary. He is married and has four children. His wife, Klára Dobrev, is a politician and member of the European Parliament. Gyurcsány is known for his love of sports, particularly basketball, and he has been involved in several sports-related initiatives in Hungary. He is also a published author, having written several books on politics and economics, including "Tűzszünet" ("Ceasefire"), which chronicles his time as Prime Minister of Hungary. Gyurcsány's personal life has been relatively private, and he has largely kept his family out of the public eye.

Ferenc Gyurcsány has faced significant criticism throughout his political career. One of the most controversial moments came in 2006, when a leaked recording of a speech revealed him admitting to lying about the state of the economy in order to win the election. The admission sparked widespread protests and calls for his resignation, and his popularity plummeted. He was also criticized for his government's handling of the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recession. Gyurcsány has also been accused of corruption, with some alleging that he used his position for personal gain. Finally, he has been criticized for his confrontational style and for his vocal opposition to the current Hungarian government, which has led some to accuse him of being divisive and obstructive.

Kamen Rider 555

Kamen Rider 555 (officially "Masked Rider Φ's", also read "Kamen Rider Faiz" or "Phi's") is a Japanese tokusatsu television drama. It is the 13th installment in the Kamen Rider Series. It is a joint collaboration between Ishimori Productions and Toei, and was broadcast on TV Asahi from January 26, 2003, to January 18, 2004. It aired as a part of TV Asahi's 2003 Super Hero Time block, alongside "Bakuryū Sentai Abaranger".

The Smart Brain corporation, the world's most powerful corporation, is trying to take over the world using Orphnoch, the "next stage in humanity's evolution", to covertly kill off the human population. In pursuit of this, they develop three suits of power armor, called Rider Gears (each for Delta, Faiz, and Kaixa), to find and protect the Orphnoch King, who can fix a defect within Orphnoch DNA which causes their genetic structure to break down, leading to death.

The Rider Gears are stolen by Hanagata, the Goat Orphnoch and former chief of Smart Brain. He sends them to his foster children (dubbed the "Ryuseiji", after the school they attended) so they can stop the Orphnoch from achieving their goal. However, Rider Gears were designed to be worn by Orphnoch, and humans are unable to activate the systems without undergoing genetic generation.

A young loner, Takumi Inui, is unwittingly drawn into the conflict between the Orphnoch and humans and becomes Kamen Rider Faiz to save the life of Mari Sonada, one of the Ryuseiji. Smart Brain begins training him in an attempt to retrieve the Faiz Gear.

However, there is division amongst the Orphnoch, as those who wish to co-exist with humans rather than kill him, begin resisting the Smart Brain, who in turn targets them as well. Most of these "renegade" Orphnochs are either killed, remain neutral or begin siding with the Ryuseiji against the Smart Brain.

When the Tokyo police discover the Orphnoch are behind a series of bizarre murders, they begin operations to defeat the creatures, largely unaware of the various factions involved. They even begin performing experiments on captured Orphnoch in an attempt to find ways of destroying them, though this does not go well.

The Orphnoch King eventually awakens within a young boy named Teruo Suzuki, whom Naoya Kaido and Keitaro Kikuchi saved and befriended. Now, it is up to the holders of the Rider Gears to band together and fight for humanity's survival.

The meadow tree frog or Gunther's Costa Rican tree frog ("Isthmohyla pseudopuma") is a frog that lives in Costa Rica and Panama. In Panama and parts of Costa Rica, it lives between 1000 and 2400 meters above sea level. On the Pacific side (west) of the mountains in Costa Rica, it lives no more than 864 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 37.6 to 42.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 41.1 and 45.6 mm long.

This frog is brown and light brown on the back and yellow on its belly. It has a white stripe on both back legs. Some of them have blue color on their middles.

This frog hides during the day in bromeliad plants and other plants with large leaves. At night, it goes to trees and bushes to look for food.

These frogs lay eggs after heavy rains. The males go to water, deep water if they can, and sing for the females. The females choose the largest male frogs. The female lays 500 eggs at a time, 1800 to 2500 eggs per female per year.

The tadpoles eat plants and dead things. They will also eat frog eggs and smaller tadpoles. They will eat eggs and tadpoles from other species or other Gunther's Costa Rican tree frogs. If the pond starts to dry up, the tadpoles become frogs quicker than if it did not dry up.

This frog is not in danger of dying out but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives, because of climate change, and because there is more ultraviolet B light than there was. This light can hurt this frog.

The movie stars by Josh Hutcherson, Jonah Bobo, Dax Shepard, Kristen Stewart, and Tim Robbins.

Walter and Danny are two brothers who do not get along with each other, or with their cantankerous teenage sister, Lisa. While their divorced father is away at work and Lisa, whom he left in charge, is napping. Danny discovers an old science fiction-themed board game called "Zathura" in the basement. When he starts playing, the game produces a card that details a meteor shower. After an actual meteor shower occurs in the living room, Walter and Danny realize the game is affecting reality.

The boys discover the house is floating in outer space. Lisa thinks she has overslept and it is evening and prepares to go out. The next card puts her in cryonic sleep, for the next five turns of the game, leaving her frozen solid. And Walter soon concludes they must win the game to return everything back to normal. As they continue to play, they overcome the dangers presented by the game, including the appearance of a detective robot, passing too close to a star, and an attack on the house by the race of reptilian aliens called Zorgons. One of Danny's turns causes an astronaut to appeared, who methodically eliminated the house's heat sources, as the Zorgons are attracted to heat. He tells Walter to turn off the pilot light on the furnace, out of the fear of getting attacked by the Zorgons. The astronaut lures the Zorgons' ship away by setting the boys' father's couch on fire and ejecting it from the house.

A board game that sought to mimic the movie's eponymous game was released by Pressman Toy Corporation. Titled "Zathura: Adventure is Waiting", the board game incorporated a spring-driven, clockwork card delivery mechanism, an astronaut, the Zorgons, the haywire robot and the disintegrating house in various ways.

A video game tie-in was released on November 3, 2005, developed by High Voltage Software and published by 2K Games for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

In 1993, the French government privatized Banque Nationale de Paris.

In early 1999, Paribas agreed to a 15-billion (USD $17-billion) buyout offer from Société Générale. Not wanting to be left behind, however, rival Banque Nationale de Paris made a hostile USD $21-billion counter-offer for Paribas, and an unimaginable, separate USD 19.6-billion offer for Societe Generale (SocGen). BNP’s three-way merger proposal would have created the world's largest bank.

Uncertainties surrounding BNP’s insane ambition resulted in a drop of its share price, reducing the combined value of the offers for Paribas and SocGen to USD $38.0 billion. For months, all three banks engaged in a public relations battle in an attempt to win support from the public, shareholders, and the French banking regulator. In the end, BNP succeeded in breaking SocGen and Paribas' merger plan, and acquired Paribas to form BNP Paribas. However, it could only secure 31.5% of SocGen's shares. The French banking regulator eventually vetoed BNP's merger plan to acquire Societe Generale.

When the new school year began in September of 1963, the schools were likewise integrated. The campaign's most important effect was the nationalization of the issues and the engagement of leaders like President John F. Kennedy.

Miquelot de Prades

Miquel de Prades ( Balaguer ) ? 1462? - Belvedere Marittimo coast 1505), known by the name of Miquelot de Prades, was a Catalan soldier famous for his skill with the sword and various military deeds. There is no certain evidence that confirms whether three documented facts (about a fencer, about a murderer and about a soldier who died at sea) can be attributed to the same person.

The historian Jerónimo Zurita explains the assassination of Juan de Borja, son of Alexander VI in Rome, in the year 1497. The death was attributed to Michalot de Prats, who was at the service of the victim. 

Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, in his work "Las Quinquagenas de la nobility de España", spoke of a Catalan soldier (Michalot de Pradas) who roamed Italy, winning all the duels with a sure thrust to the opponent's neck. Repentant of his life, that soldier went to take refuge in the monastery of Montserrat. One bad day an Italian soldier with two swords showed up and challenged Miquelot (saying that he wanted to see the secret thrust, claiming that he would know how to counter it). Miquelot flatly refused to fight but the other's insistence forced him to do so. The Italian ended up dead, with a thrust to the neck. There was probably no better way to teach it. Repentant of the new death, he went to Rome to ask for forgiveness. The pope incorporated him into his troops. 


There is a Michalot de Prats who with an armed caravel in Naples chased and made some corsairs flee near Belvedere Marittimo (a priori, without any relationship, with the previous events). Michalot's ship, some ships that accompanied him and the captured privateers suffered a sudden storm and sank (year 1505). All the crew were drowned.

Farn-Sasan

Farn-Sasan was the last king in the Indo-Parthian Kingdom who ruled Sakastan from about 210 to 226. There are no books that talk about him. He is only known because of the coins he issued. He was killed in 226 by the ruler Ardashir I. Because of this, the Indo-Parthian rule ended.

Then name "Sasan" was popular with the Indo-Parthian people. The origin of the name is not entirely known. David Neil MacKenzie and V.A. Livshits says that the name comes from Old Iranian, translating to *"Sāsāna" ("defeating enemy"). It is also the name of a Zoroastrian deity.

Farn-Sasan went into the Indo-Parthian throne sometime in 210. They don't know what king was before him. They think it may have been Pacores. Farn-Sasan is not mentioned in any books. He is only known because of his coins. These coins all say "Farn-Sasan, son of Adur-Sasan, grandson of Tirdat, son of the grandson of Sanabares, the King of Kings." Farn-Sasan tried to make himself notable by his rule by showing that he was related to his great-grandfather, Sanabares, a famous Indo-Parthian king. He calls the King of Kings Sanabares the King of Kings. Farn-Sasan also called himself the King of Kings. This happened a lot in Achaemenid and Parthian rulers.

Adur-Sasan and Tirdat were never a ruler. This means that Farn-Sasan was probably from a cadet branch in the dynasty.

On the front side of the coins, he is seen with a cap. On the other side, a fire altar is shown. The altar has writing around it. Farn-Sasan is the only king that is known to have a fire altar on coins that is also from Sakastan. Around the same time, Ardashir I () made coins with a fire-altar that looked like Farn-Sasan's coins. Historians are not sure if Farn-Sasan copied the fire altar or if Ardashir I copied the fire altar off of Farn-Sasan.

Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I share a similar name. Because of this and the fact that both of their coin has a fire altar, historians think Sasanians and Indo-Parthians may have had common ancestry. Historians say that Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I were rivals. Both wanted to be the King of Kings. The Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani argues that Farn-Sasan was a superior of Ardashir I. He said that Ardashir I was only able to say that he was the King of Kings after he defeated Farn-Sasan in 226 and ended Indo-Parthian rule.

Georg Forster

Johann George Adam Forster, also known as Georg Forster (, 27 November 1754 – 10 January 1794), was a German naturalist, ethnologist, travel writer, journalist and revolutionary. When he was young, he went with his father. Johann Reinhold Forster on many scientific trips. One of these was James Cook's second trip to the Pacific. Forster wrote about this trip in the book "A Voyage Round the World". The book helped contribute to the ethnology to people in Polynesia. It still is a respected work. Because of this book, Forster was let into the Royal Society when he was 22. He was thought to be one of the founders of modern scientific travel literature.

Forster went back to Continental Europe after his trips. Forster decided then to have many jobs in education and learning. He taught natural history at the Collegium Carolinum in the Ottoneum, Kassel (1778–84). He then worked at the Academy of Vilna (1784–87). In 1788, he was the head librarian at the University of Mainz. Here, he did lot of scientific work on essays on botany and ethnology . He also translated and wrote a lot of books about travel and exploration. For example, he wrote a German translation of Cook's diaries.

Forster was a large figure in the Enlightenment in Germany. He talked closely with many of his close friends. His ideas, writings and personality influenced Alexander von Humboldt. Humboldt was a famous scientist in the 19th century. When France took control of Mainz in 1792, Forster played a big role in the Mainz Republic (the earliest republican state in Germany). During July 1793 and while he was in Paris as a delegate of the young Mainz Republic, Prussian and Austrian coalition forces regained control of the city and Forster was declared an outlaw. Forster was not able to go back to Germany. He was separated from his friends and family. In early 1794, he died in Paris of illness.

Georg Forster was born in Nassenhuben on 27 November 1754. Nassenhuben is a village near Danzig which is now Mokry Dwór, Poland. Georg was the oldest of seven surviving children of Johann Reinhold Forster, a Reformed Protestant pastor and scholar, and his wife Justina Elisabeth, . When George was young, Georg liked the study of nature. When his father learned natural history from the books of Carl Linnaeus, he taught his son biology. He also taught George Latin, French and religion. In 1765, Reinhold got a commission(a written instruction) by the Russian government to inspect colonies that were near Saratov on the Volga River. They were mostly settled by German colonists. Ten-year old Georg went his father on this journey. The journey was long. It led to the Kalmyk Steppe and Lake Elton where they got collected hundreds of samples plants. George helped his father with naming and identification.
On October 1765, George Forster went to Saint Peter's School in St Petersburg. While Forster was in school, his father made reports about the colony. His report was very critical of the voivode(the military leader) of Saratov. He also thought the conditions of the colony were bad. Because of this, the Forsters left Russia without payment because they were angry at Grigory Orlov. The Forsters went on a journey from Kronstadt to London. On the journey, Georg learned English and practiced Russian. They got to London on 4 October 1766. Georg was 12 when they got to London. Georg translated Lomonosov's history of Russia into English. He also added on to the book to include recent events. The book was printed and was presented to the Society of Antiquaries on 21 May 1767. In June 1767, father moved to Warrington to became a teacher at Warrington Academy. He succeeded Joseph Priestley. This left Georg behind in London. He became an apprentice there with a merchant. He was an apprentice until the rest of the family got to England in September 1767. He moved to Warrington. In Warrington, Georg learned classics and religion from John Aikin. He learned mathematics from John Holt. He learned French and natural history from his father.

The Forsters moved back to London in 1770. Reinhold Forster got many scientific contacts and became a member of the Royal Society in 1772. When Joseph Banks left Cook's expedition, Reinhold was invited by the British Admiralty to join James Cook's second expedition to the Pacific Ocean(1772–75). Georg Forster went with his father in the expedition. He became the draughtsman to his father. Reinhold had to work on scientific reports of any discoveries that they made. It was published when they got back from the expedition.

They got onto the HMS "Resolution" for Cook's second expedition on 13 July 1772, in Plymouth. The ship got them first to the South Atlantic. Then it went through the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean. While they were around the Southern Ocean, they went to the islands of Polynesia. They finally went around Cape Horn back to England on 30 July 1775. On their journey, they went to New Zealand, the Tonga islands, New Caledonia, Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands and Easter Island. They went the most south anyone has ever been. They almost discovered Antarctica. The journey disproved the "Terra Australis Incognita" theory. The "Terra Australis" theory claimed there was a big continent in the South that people were able to live in.

Georg Forster first studied zoology and botanics of the southern seas with his father. He did this mostly by drawing animals and plants. Georg, however, also went with his own interests. It led to to independent missions in geography and ethnology. He quickly learned the languages of the Polynesian islands. He wrote many reports on the people of Polynesia. They are very popular today. In his reports, he talks about the people of the southern islands with empathy, sympathy and without Western or Christian bias.

Louis Antoine de Bougainville went to Tahiti a few years before Forster's trip. His reports said that the people there were a type of "noble savage" romanticism. Forster, however, thought that the South Pacific Islands were very intelligent. He wrote about many different social structures and religions that he saw on the Society Islands, Easter Island, Tonga and New Zealand. He wrote about the differences with the different people. He also noticed that the languages of the islands were all scattered but were usually alike. He wrote that the Nomuka islands had languages, vehicles, weapons, furniture, clothes, tattoos, beards were almost exactly the same with tribes on Tongatapu.The journey had many scientific results that were very helpful. However, the Forsters and Cook and his officers were very unkind to each other. This was because Reinfield Forster had a large temper. Cook also didn't allow for the Forsters to spend more on botany and the Forster's science. Cook didn't allow scientists on his third journey because of the Forsters.

People was annoyed with the Forsters after his trip as well. Lord Sandwich was annoyed with Johann Reinhold Forster's first chapter in his book. He tried to change. Forster, however, said that him being corrected However, Forster did not want to have his writing corrected "like a theme of a School-boy". He wouldn't allow any compromise. Because of this, the book was written by Cook. The Forsters were not allowed to compile the book. They did not get payment for the work, either. While Lord Sandwich and Reinhold Forster were arguing, Georg put out an unofficial book on their travel. In 1777, the book "A Voyage Round the World in His Britannic Majesty's Sloop Resolution, Commanded by Capt. James Cook, during the Years, 1772, 3, 4, and 5" was published. It was published six weeks before the official version came out. The unofficial version was very popular. Georg got lots of fame from this. In 1778–80, Georg, published it in German. The poet Christoph Martin Wieland like the book. He said it was the most important one of his time. Even today, it was one of the most important journey descriptions written. The book changed German literature, culture and science. It inspired many scientists such as Alexander von Humboldt. It also inspired many modern ethnologists.

Forster's German translation was seen as very looked-through. It was scientifically correct. It was also seen as exciting and easy to read. Most travel literature of this time was a basic writing of data. Georg's book was, however seen as, colourful and reliable ethnographical. They were very detailed and sympathetic. He also wrote about philosophy in books in his observations. He focused on the behaviour of people, their customs, habits, religions and social organization. In "A Voyage Round the World" he wrote about the songs from Polynesian people. He included lyrics and notation. The book is one of the most important writings that is about the Southern Pacific from before European influence had become more significant.

"A Voyage Round the World" made Georg Forster have scientific recognition in Europe. The Royal Society made him a member on 9 January 1777. He was not even 23 years old at the time. He also got other titles from academies from Berlin to Madrid. Georg, however didn't get any money from getting these titles.

He went to Paris to look for the American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin in 1777. He wanted to talk with him. In 1778, he went to Germany become a natural history professor at the Collegium Carolinum in Kassel. Georg met Therese Heyne there. She was the daughter of the classicist Christian Gottlob Heyne. Heyne later became one of the first independent female writers in Germany. Georg later married Heyne in 1785(at that time, Georg had already left Kassel). Their marriage was seen as not very happy. They had had two surviving children, Therese Forster and Clara Forster. While Forster was still in Kassel, Forster like to talk with many people who were important in the Enlightenment. Some people he talked to was Lessing, Johann Gottfried Herder, Christoph Martin Wieland and Goethe. He also got cooperation with the Collegium Carolinum in Kassel and the University of Göttingen where his friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg worked. Together, they founded and published the scientific journal "Göttingisches Magazin der Wissenschaften und Litteratur".
By 1783, Forster saw that talking with all of with these people led him away from science. It was also pushing him into deeper debt. He was known to not be very good with money. Because of this, Forster was happy to get a job from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Commission of National Education. He became the Chair of Natural History at Vilnius University in 1784. At first, he did well in Vilnius. After some time, however, he began to feel isolated. Most of the people that he knew were still scientists from Germany that he met before. In 1785, Forster went to Halle where put in a thesis on the plants of the South Pacific for a doctorate in medicine. Forster's plans to build a natural history scientific centre could not get enough financial support from authorities in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His famous speech about natural history in 1785 went wouldn't be noticed or even printed until 1843. Eventually, he broke the contract six years before it was over. This is because Catherine II of Russia had asked Forster to go around the world with him on his journey(the Mulovsky expedition). If he came with him, he would be paid as a professor in Saint Petersburg. This made a conflict between Forster and the Polish scientist Jędrzej Śniadecki. Catherine II of Russia, however, decided to not let him go on his journey. After that, Forster left Vilnius. He then went in Mainz. Here he became the head librarian at the University of Mainz. He succeeded Johannes von Müller who was a friend of Forster. He made sure that Forster would succeed him when Müller moved to become the administration of Elector Friedrich Karl Josef von Erthal.

While Forster was a librarian, he published essays very often on explorations. He continued to be a very good translator. For example, he wrote about Cook's third journey to the South Pacific. He also wrote and about the "Bounty" expedition. He translated Cook's and Bligh's diaries from those journeys into German.

Forster was also interested in indology. When he was going to go on his failed expedition that was funded by Catherine II, one of his main goals was to go to India. He translated the Sanskrit play "Shakuntala" with a Latin version that was written by Sir William Jones. This helped influence Johann Gottfried Herder. It improved German interest in indology.

In mid 1790, Forster and Alexander von Humboldt went on a long journey through the Southern Netherlands, the United Provinces, and England. The finished in Paris. Forster wrote about this journey in a three volume book series called "Ansichten vom Niederrhein, von Brabant, Flandern, Holland, England und Frankreich im April, Mai und Juni 1790" ("Views of the Lower Rhine, from Brabant, Flanders, Holland, England, and France in April, May and June 1790"). It was published in 1791–94. Goethe said about that this book makes someone to read if again and travel the journey themself. The book talks about the history of art that were influential for art as "A Voyage Round the world" was for ethnology.

Forster's biggest interest, however, was with the behaviour of people. The uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France made him very interested in that. His journey through the Netherlands and England where people were developed made him make a political opinion. Because of this, he became a confident opponent of the ancien régime. Like many other German scholars, he welcomed the revolution as a result of the Enlightenment. A little bit after he heard about the Storming of the Bastille in 30 July 1789, he wrote to his father-in-law. In his note he wrote about how beautiful to see the philosophy that happened. 

The French revolutionary army that was under General Custine got control of Mainz on 21 October 1792. Two days after this, Forster joined in creating a Jacobin Club. It was called "Freunde der Freiheit und Gleichheit" ("Friends of Freedom and Equality"). He helped in organizing the Mainz Republic in 1793. The first one made in Germany was a democracy. Forster became the vice-president the their administration. He was a candidate in the election for the local parliament, the ("Rhenish-German National Convention"). He was an editor of ("The new Mainz newspaper or The People's Friend") from January to March 1793. In his first article that he made, he wrote:

This freedom did not last very long. In July 1973, French troops ended the Mainz Republic.

Forster was not in Mainz when France took over. Since he was part of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux went to Paris to apply for Mainz to become a part of the French Republic. The application was accepted, but didn't have any effect since Mainz was took over by France. Forster lost his library and his things. He decided to stay in Paris.

Emperor Francis II made a decree(or law) that would give punishments on German people who helped the French French Revolutionary government. Forster became an outlaw because of this. He was placed under the Imperial ban. 100 ducats were put on his head. Because of this, he could not go back to Germany. He did not have his wife because she stayed in Mainz with her children and future husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber. He also did not have any way to make money. He stayed in Paris. Paris had just started the Reign of Terror under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster was able to see the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness and its cruel practices. Many German supporters of the revolution like Friedrich Schiller turned back from their opinions from the terror. Forster, however did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals from the Reign of Terror. He saw what happened in France as a force that could not be slowed. Forster thought that had to become calmer and if they didn't, France could destroy even more.

In January 1794 when he was 39, Forster died from rheumatic illness before the Reign of Terror was its peak. He was planning to go to India at the time.

Forster had some Scottish family. He was born in born in Polish Royal Prussia. This made him a Polish subject by birth. He worked in Russia, England, Poland and in German countries of his time. Finally, he died in France. He worked in different places. He travelled a lot from when he was a youth. His thoughts made very big scientific discoveries from the Enlightenment. It also people different views on ethnic and national communities.

In his opinion, all human beings had some feelings and imagination. They are used in different ways, however. These different ways makes different cultures and civilizations. Forster said cultures like Tierra del Fuego is at a lower level of development than European culture. He also said that living on places like that is harder and there is less chance to have higher culture. This opinions were one of the biggest examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.

He used insulting words against Poles with prejudice in his letters when he was in Vilnius and in a diary from when he when through Poland. He, however, but he never showed it in his publications. It was only known after he had died when these conversations and diaries were shown to the public. Forster's writings were seen as scientifically based. Forster's prejudice against Poland usually taken as factual in Imperial Germany and Nazi Germany. The ""Polnische Wirtschaft"" (Polish economy) stereotype was probably because of his letters.

Forster's thoughts and attitude got him into trouble with other countries. It made not welcome by anyone. He wanted a revolution too much in Germany. He was too proud in England. He didn't like Polish science in Poland. He wasn't popular enough and was ignored in France.

After Forster's died, most of his books were forgotten. The only place they were remembered were in some circles. This was mostly because he was a part of the French Revolution. People like him differently throughout history. Their opinion on usually changed with their political beliefs. After the Napoleonic era, he Germans thought that he was a traitor. People thought this even though people like Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel wrote good things about him.

His life was revived a little bit in the buildup to the 1848 revolution. He was, however, forgotten in Wilhelm II and Nazi Germany. Here, the only interest in Forster was from his thoughts of Poland. In the1960s in East Germany, however, people began to remember him more. This is because people thought that he showed class struggle. The GDR research station in Antarctica that was opened on 25 October 1987 was named after him. The Alexander von Humboldt foundation named a scholarship program after him. The scholarship was for foreign people from developing countries. He was a very good German ethnologist. His works are seen as very helpful in Germany's ethnology.

The ethnographical items collected by Georg and Johann Reinhold Forster are now presented as the "Cook-Forster-Sammlung" (Cook–Forster Collection) in the Sammlung für Völkerkunde anthropological collection in Göttingen. Another collection of items collected by the Forsters is on display at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford.

Heliopolis (Roman Phoenicia)

Heliopolis of Phoenicia was a colony of the Roman Empire. The name was Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Heliopolitana and is now the Baalbeck of modern Lebanon. It is a Unesco world heritage site

Ancient Baalbek (under its Hellenic name Heliopolis) formed part of the kingdoms of Egypt & Syria. It was annexed by the Romans during their eastern wars. The Italic settlers of the Roman colony "Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Heliopolitana" may have arrived as early as the time of Caesar but were more probably the veterans of two Roman Legions under Augustus, during which time it hosted a Roman garrison. 

Indeed the veterans of two Roman legions were established in the city (and region) of Berytus (actual Beyrut) by emperor Augustus: the "Legio V Macedonica" and the "Legio III Gallica"., and Heliopolis from 15 BC to 193 AD formed part of the territory of Berytus. The population was mainly local in the second century under Hadrian with a few descendants of the Roman colonists and likely varied seasonally with market fairs and the schedules of the Camel caravans to the coast and interior.

The present "Temple of Jupiter" presumably replaced an earlier one using the same foundation.

The presence of a huge quarry was one of the reasons for the Roman decision to create a huge "Great Court" of a big pagan temple complex in this mountain site, located at nearly 1100 meters of altitude and on the eastern borders of the Roman Empire: it took three centuries to create this colossal Roman paganism's temple complex, called "Sanctuary" of Heliopolis.

Heliopolis was a noted oracle and pilgrimage site, whence the cult spread far afield, with inscriptions to the Heliopolitan god discovered in Athens, Rome, Pannonia, Venetia, Gaul, and near the Wall in Britain. The Roman 
temple complex grew up from the early part of the reign of Augustus in the late 1st century until the rise of Christianity in the 4th century. The 6th-century chronicles of John Malalas of Antioch, which claimed Baalbek as a "wonder of the world" credited most of the complex to the 2nd-century Antoninus Pius. By that time, the complex housed three temples on Tell Baalbek: one to Jupiter Heliopolitanus (Baʿal), one to Venus Heliopolitana (Ashtart), and a third to Bacchus. On a nearby hill, a fourth temple was dedicated to the third figure of the Heliopolitan Triad, Mercury (Adon). Ultimately, the site vied with Praeneste in Italy as the two largest sanctuaries in the Western world.

The emperor Trajan consulted the site's oracle twice. In 193 AD, Septimius Severus granted the city the famous "ius Italicum" rights and the city grew in importance in all the Roman Levant.

In the third century Heliopolis had a population of nearly 20000 inhabitants and there was an hippodrome with even a theater, just outside the "Great Court" area of the temples. Additionally a temple of Mercury stood on top of the hill outside the ramparts. A long staircase led up to it from the town, as is shown on coins of Heliopolis struck under emperor Philip the Arab. Remains of the temple, the line of the staircase, and parts of its parapet have been found. Still remain some sections of the Roman walls, with square forts around the old city

The town became a battleground upon the rise of Christianity, because it was an important center of Roman paganism.
Early Christian writers such as Eusebius (from nearby Caesarea) repeatedly execrated the practices of the local pagans in their worship of the Heliopolitan Venus. In the early 4th century, the deacon Cyril defaced many of the idols in Heliopolis; he was killed and (allegedly) cannibalised Around the same time, Constantine, though not yet a Christian, demolished the goddess's temple, raised a basilica in its place, and outlawed the locals' ancient custom of prostituting women before marriage. The enraged locals responded by raping and torturing Christian virgins. The city was so noted for its hostility to the Christians, that Alexandrians were banished to it as a special punishment.

The Temple of Jupiter, already greatly damaged by earthquakes, was partially demolished under Theodosius in 379 AD and replaced by another basilica (now lost), using stones scavenged from the pagan complex. The "Easter Chronicles" states he was also responsible for destroying nearly all the lesser temples and shrines of the city. Around the year 400 AD, Rabbula, the future bishop of the diocese of Edessa, attempted to have himself martyred by disrupting the pagans of Baalbek but was only thrown down the temple stairs along with his companion. It became the seat of its own bishop as well. Under the reign of Justinian, eight of the complex's Corinthian columns were disassembled and shipped to Constantinople for incorporation in the rebuilt Hagia Sophia sometime between 532 and 537 AD.

Michael the Syrian claimed the golden idol of Heliopolitan Jupiter was still to be seen during the reign of Justin II (560s & 570s),and, up to the time of its conquest by the Muslims in 637 AD, it was renowned for its palaces, monuments, and gardens. The Arabs under Abu Ubaidah -who conquered the city after a damaging siege- renamed the city as "Baalbeck" (that in ancient Lebanese Arab language probably meaned "Bacchus ruins"). The Christians left the city, that lost importance in the next centuries (even because of the growth of nearby Damascus, that was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 AD) and in the tenth century was reduced to be just a small village.

In 1170 AD the arab city of Baalbeck was hit by a terrible earthquake that fully destroyed the Temple of Jupiter, leaving only a few columns standing, and heavily damaged the "Great Court" of ancient Heliopolis's temple complex.

Bench trial

A bench trial is a trial where there is no jury. A judge decides who wins or loses without a jury. Some law systems use bench trials for almost all cases (Roman, Islamic). Others use them for only some cases or only some kinds of cases. The rules for bench trials may be different in courts that hear accused criminals and courts that hear lawsuits.

In jury trials, it is the judge's job to say what is the law and the jury's job to find the facts. In a bench trial, the judge does both. In some bench trials, both sides already agree on what the facts are. For example, in civil disobedience cases designed to test the law, accused people often agree with the prosecuting lawyers about what happened. They only want the judge to say whether it really was illegal.

Bench trials are usually faster than jury trials because the court has to do fewer things. For example, there is no jury selection and no need to send the jury to live separately or give them special instructions. For example, if lawyers in a jury trial disagree about whether one piece of evidence should be shown to the jury, they must call for a sidebar and talk to the judge about it privately. In a bench trial, they do not have to keep anything secret from a jury. The judge can also make the trial start and stop when they want. The judge may decide to let the lawyers skip opening and closing statements.

Sometimes, people ask for a bench trial if the evidence is scientific or hard to understand.

A bench trial is almost the same as a jury trial in other ways. For example, the rules of evidence and methods of objection are the same in a bench trial as in a jury trial. Bench trials can be more informal than jury trials. It is often less necessary to protect the record with objections, and sometimes evidence is accepted "de bene" because it can be removed in the future.

When a jury makes a decision at the end of a trial, it is called a verdict. When a judge in a bench trial makes a decision at the end of a trial, it is called a finding.

Most civil trials in England and Wales are bench trials.

Summary criminal trials may be heard by a single district judge (Magistrates' Court) or by a group of two or more magistrates, usually three.

Section 47 Criminal Justice Act 2003 does allow a bench trial, but they are rare. There have been only two bench trials of this kind since 2003.

Most civil trials in Scotland are conducted in the Sheriff Court by a Sheriff sitting alone. In the Court of Session, a judge from either the outer or inner house usually sits over the trial alone; but the judge may work with a jury if the trial is for personal injury. See: Trial by jury in Scotland

Summary criminal trials are conducted by a Sheriff in the Sheriff Court or a Justice of the Peace in the Justice of the Peace Court sitting alone. The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 says this. Trials requiring juries are called solemn procedure.

The Commission of Inquiry of 2008–2009 in Turks and Caicos said that the law should allow some criminal trials without juries the way England and Wales, the United States, India, Canada, the British overseas territories of the Falkland Islands and St. Helena, and the Netherlands all do.

In United States law, people on trial for crimes have the right to trial by jury, but sometimes they can choose to have a bench trial instead if they want. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution says so.

For an accused person to have a bench trial in the federal court system, three things must happen: The accused person must say in writing that they do not want a jury, the government must agree, and the court itself must agree. The law that says so is rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

The state court systems have different rules. For example, Missouri has Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27.01(b), "The defendant may, with the assent of the court, waive a trial by jury and submit the trial of any criminal case to the court..." Missouri does not have a rule saying the government must agree.

Some judicial proceedings, such as probate, family law, crimes and other cases where there is a child and other civil cases do not normally use juries. In such courts, judges say both fact and law.

The Vaccine Courts has bench trials.

In most countries with "Roman law," or civil law, there is no "jury" in the English sense, and trials are always bench trials. However, in more complicated cases, lay judges can be called. They are not randomly selected, as juries are. They are volunteers and vote as judges.

The instrument is also used as a background instrument for folk games such as satire, karagam, kavadi, poikkal kudirai etc. Angalaparameswari sings folk songs to the tune of pamaba at folk temple festivals such as Shakti Karagam Invitation.

Video editing software

A video editing software, also called a video editor, is software (a program) that allows users to edit videos and images. Popular video editing softwares include Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere Pro, and DaVinci Resolve.

Video editing software can be used to change the time when a video is played or to cut videos into many parts. It can also be used to put music and sounds at the same time as the video.

When the person editing the video is done, the software can export the file— to change it into a video file.

A video editor has many parts. There is a part which is called the timeline. This part is used to move the videos, sounds, and pictures into different parts.

Other than videos, sounds, and pictures, a person can add writing on the video, using a text clip. This writing can be used as the title of the video, or as the credits at the end of the video.

When you go to the right side of the timeline, the video moves forward, but when you go to the left side, the video moves backwards.

Videos can be added above and below another video. This lets you play two videos together at the same time.

The timeline can be used to add a fade effect. This will make a video turn into another video smoothly. Without the fade effect, videos will change suddenly.

The video editor can be used to add visual effects. A visual effect is something not real that looks real. For example, there is a green wall behind a man. The video editor can take the man out of the green wall, and make the man look like he is inside another place.

A video editing software can be used to edit the colors of a video. This can make the video look more good. For example, the colors can be made bright or dark.

To use video editing software, a strong computer is needed, but sometimes it is possible to use a weak computer.

A video uses a lot of capacity, so a big hard disk or solid-state drive needs to be used to put the video. If the capacity is not big enough, the video will not fit.

Many companies make video editing software.

Will Smith–Chris Rock slapping incident

During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, then-Academy Award nominated actor Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face, who was presenting the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. 

Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, comparing her to the movie "G.I. Jane". Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia, was sitting in the audience next to her husband Smith. After the joke, Smith walked onto the stage, and slapped Rock in the face. Smith then returned to his seat and twice shouted, "Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth!" The next day, he apologized to Rock and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences via Instagram.

The event went viral, causing many to talk about insult comedy, violence, and how to respect your family. 

After the joke, Smith laughed and smiled, while Pinkett Smith was not happy. The broadcast then returned to Rock and shortly afterwards Smith was seen walking across the stage directly towards Rock. Without speaking, Smith slapped Rock across the face, then turned around and returned to the audience. Rock's reaction, and Smith's comments were:

During the same ceremony, Smith went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for the movie "King Richard". In his acceptance speech, Smith said that love made him do "crazy things".

Smith's response was not supported by many celebrities, although some supported his actions as a defense of his wife. Others criticized Rock's joke and Smith's reaction. The uncensored version of the event went on YouTube had over 69 million views within 24 hours, becoming one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences criticized Smith's actions and announcing a formal review the next day. When the event happened, the Academy thought about removing Smith from the Oscars broadcast, but decided against it. Chris Rock, according to the Los Angeles Police Department, did not want to press charges against Smith. SAG-AFTRA also said they did not support Smith's actions and began working with the Academy to see how Smith should be punished. On April 8, the Academy said that Smith will be banned from attending any Academy Award-event for the next ten years.

After the public and celebrities criticized Smith, he apologized the next day calling his actions "unacceptable" and "inexcusable". He later apologized to Rock saying "I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong". He later said he was embarrassed of his actions and that he was wrong to react violently. On April 1, Smith resigned his membership from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and said he would support any punishment by the academy.

Dyeing poison dart frog

The tinging frog, dyeing poison arrow frog, dyeing poison frog, blue poison frog, blue poison arrow frog, or giant poison frog ("Dendrobates tinctorius") is a frog that lives in Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname, and Brazil.

For some time, scientists thought this frog was two species: "Dendrobates azureus" and "Dendrobates tinctorius". Now they know it is one species that can be two different colors. These two types of frog in the same species are called morphs. The blue color morph ("azureus") is bright blue-black legs and back, light blue sides, a light blue belly with spots, and spots on its head and back. Sometimes it has a dark stripe on its belly. The other morph has yellow color on its body. The adult male frog has bigger disks on its toes for climbing than adult female frogs have. Both frogs are poisonous, but the blue frogs have more poison than the yellow ones.

Scientists studied the colors on this frog using computers with a learning algorithm. They wanted to know how different predators, for example humans, reptiles, and birds, could see the frog against the dead leaves on the ground. They found that, at a short distance, frogs of both color morphs were easy to see. But further away, both color morphs were hard to see. Both the blue and yellow colors acted like camouflage. Scientists think that, because the frog is poisonous, it has bright colors to tell any nearby predator not to eat it.

This frog lives in forests that are not too high above sea level. These forests have rocky streams and water in the air.

The adult male frog sits on the ground or on leaves and sings for the female frog. The female frog comes near the male frog and touches his nose. Then the male leads the female to a body of water, where she lays 2 to 6 eggs. Usually, the male frog guards the eggs until they hatch. Sometimes the female frog does. The eggs take 14 to 18 days to hatch into tadpoles. Then the male and female frogs carry them away. They take the tadpoles to small bodies of water, for example in the leaves of a bromeliad plant. The frogs take them very far away. Sometimes the parent frogs will walk right past other pools of water to get to ones further away. Scientists think it is good for the frog's survival to spread out over a wide distance so the new frogs will not have to fight each other for food as much.

Inside the new body of water, the tadpoles fight. Sometimes they eat each other. Usually, only one tadpole per body of water lives to become a new frog. But sometimes there are two. Scientists studied the fighting tadpoles. They found that when one tadpole was much bigger than the other, they usually did not fight. They believe this is because both tadpoles knew who would lose. They also found that when two tadpoles in the same pool had the same parents, they only fought half as often as tadpoles that were not related to each other.

"CODA" became the first-ever Best Picture winner in the Academy's history to be made by an internet streaming service (in this case, Apple TV+). The movie won two other awards, Best Supporting Actor for Troy Kotsur and Best Screenplay for its writer and director, Sian Heder. 

"Dune" won six awards. "Zack Snyder's Justice League" won the first ever Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the Oscars Fan Favorite Award.

During the ceremony, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock in the face. Rock had made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.

Viral entry

Viral entry is when a virus goes into the cell that it has infected. It is the first part of the virus’s life. 

Most viruses share some basics steps. First, the virus has to stick or attach to the outside of the cell. Then some proteins react to each other. After that, there are a few different ways that viral entry can happen.

The first way is called membrane fusion. The outside layer of the cell has a hole poked in it for the virus to go in.

The second way is called endocytosis. The cell thinks the virus is food and eats it.

The third way is Viral penetration. This is where the virus injects itself into the cell.

Jhumka (earring style)

Jhumka is a type of earrings worn by women in the Indian subcontinent. 

During the Mughal Empire, Kharanpul Jhumka evolved as a unique piece of jewelry. Its clock shape is still the same as before. Jhumka is also known as "Jhumki" in some areas. The jewelry has maintained its status as an earring throughout the history of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. People only wear these earrings for the Indian traditional dance Bharatanatyam. 
The source of this popular earring style is probably the ancient temple statues of the Chola dynasty (they may be as old as 300 BC). According to a second-generation jeweler Fleur van Gelder, the temple was decorated with ornaments to pay homage to the gods. As a result, traditional temple dancers began to wear similar ornaments adorned with idols of the gods and goddesses of the temple.
Originating in South India, "Jhumka" gained nationwide acceptance as earrings, especially from the royal family. But everyone adapted to the shape of the bell to create their own style. The jhumka were lighter than the other jewelry because they were hollow inside.

The Hindi film "Mera Saya" (1986) a song named "Barelike Bazar Mein" about the loss of the lead actress's "Jhumka".

Also, in 2020, a jhumka weighing 262 kg was placed on a 14-foot-high pole next to the Lucknow-Delhi highway in Bareilly. The Jhumka was made with the famous lacework of the area.

Nungthel Leima is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion. She is an adopted daughter of God Koupalu (Koubru) and Goddess Kounu. She is a wife of God Loyalakpa. She is regarded as the deity of the Khunjahanba. She is one of the incarnations of Leimarel Sidabi.

The name "Thoudu Nungthel Leima" (ꯊꯧꯗꯨ ꯅꯨꯡꯊꯦꯜ ꯂꯩꯃ, /tʰəu.du núŋ.tʰel lə́i.ma/) or "Thoudu Nungthen Leima" (ꯊꯧꯗꯨ ꯅꯨꯡꯊꯦꯟ ꯂꯩꯃ, /tʰəu.du núŋ.tʰen lə́i.ma/) is made up of three Meitei language words, "Thoudu Nung" (ꯊꯧꯗꯨ ꯅꯨꯡ, /tʰəu.du núŋ/), "Thel" (ꯊꯦꯜ, /tʰel/) or "Then" (ꯊꯦꯟ, /tʰen/) and "Leima" (ꯂꯩꯃ). In Meitei language (Manipuri language), "Thoudu Nung" (ꯊꯧꯗꯨ ꯅꯨꯡ, /tʰəu.du núŋ/) means stone. This term is typically used in poems and verses.
In Meitei language (Manipuri language), "Thel" (ꯊꯦꯜ, /tʰel/) or "Then" (ꯊꯦꯟ, /tʰen/) means "to " or "to ".
In Meitei language (Manipuri language), "Leima" (ꯂꯩꯃ, /lə́i.ma/) means queen. The word "Leima" (ꯂꯩꯃ, /lə́i.ma/) itself is made up of two words, "Lei" (ꯂꯩ, /lə́i/) and "Ma" (ꯃ, /ma/). "Lei" (ꯂꯩ, /lə́i/) means land and "Ma" (ꯃ, /ma/) means mother.

Goddess Thoudu Nungthel Leima is described as the deity of the Khunjahanba. ""Khunjahanba"" means ""the first villager"" or ""the first citizen of a place"". In Meitei language (Manipuri language), "khunja" (ꯈꯨꯟꯖꯥ, /kʰun.ja/) means "a villager". Morphologically, "khunja" (ꯈꯨꯟꯖꯥ, /kʰun.ja/) is divided into "khun" (ꯈꯨꯟ, /kʰun/) and "-ja" (ꯖꯥ, /ja/).

Goddess Leimarel Sidabi incarnated herself as a little girl and laid herself on a stone slab in the riverbed. On the very day, God Koubru and Goddess Kounu were walking on a nearby place. God Koubru got very thirsty. So, he went down the riverside to drink water. He found the girl on the river bed. Koubru shouted three times asking if there was anyone for the baby girl. Since no one responded, Koubru and Kounu brought the girl to their divine home. The girl was adopted as their own daughter. She was given three names. She was named "Ipok Leima" ("Eepok Leima") because she was found in the stream. She was also named "Thoudu Nungthel Leima" because she was found lying on the stone slab. She was given her final name as "Taipang Nganpi" ("Taibang Nganbi") because she was beautiful as well as bright.

Nungthel Leima is married to God Loyalakpa. However, she was once admired by God Khoriphaba. Once Khoriphaba was offered a chance by God Koubru to choose any lady of his own desire from the latter's place. Unfortunately, Goddess Nungthel Leima was chosen by Khoriphaba. But since Nungthel Leima was already married, God Koubru could not give Khoriphaba the chosen lady. Koubru did not want to take back his own words. So, he asked Khoriphaba to choose a lady once again but he should do it blindfolded. Blindfolded Khoiriphaba tried to choose but could not get Goddess Nungthel Leima. This event is enacted by the maibis in the Lai Haraoba festival till present times.

The sacred Lai Haraoba festival is annually celebrated in honor of goddess Thoudu Nungthel Leima, besides other deities.
On the 19th of January, 2018, a newly built temple to Ema Nungthel Leima was opened at "Top Siphai" by , the then MLA of . During the ceremony, Oinam Lukhoi made a proposal to to re-develop the existing sacred temples in the Wangoi AC, including other temples of goddess Nungthel Leima.

"Nungthel Leima Tollomkhombada Thajaba" is a book written by Naoroibam Khamba. It was released on the 17th of January, 2021.

Beal conjecture

The Beal Conjecture is the USD $1,000,000 prize conjecture created by Andrew Beal in 1993, which has come to be worth 7 figures over nearly 30 years; a 2-year wait is lifted by the Beal bank on winnings, according to the conjecture's website. It is a generalization conjecture of FLT, the last conjecture of Pierre de Fermat. So in terms of valuation of the prize, it's worth less than a million; due to the time value of money or TVM.

The conjecture asks why common factors always exist for equations of the form a^x+b^y=c^z. If the equations are made equivalent to batteries, cells are always a real number; an RCF- real common factor.

Hodge conjecture

Hodge's Conjecture, or (The) Hodge Conjecture, also known as "Hodge's Letter-A Problem," or Hodge's Letter, is a Millennium Problem and a meme, and one whose expression has grown in length and complexity over the years, being seen generally a "problem of diversion," but not a "problem-problem." Hodge's Letter may help the world understand more about algebra topology, and how long straight-lines meet.

In 1924, before Hodge even made the conjecture in 1950, Solomon Lefschetz ForMemRS proved it for codimension 1. In other words, every Hodge class in H²(X, ℚ) is algebraic. By duality, this also shows that every Hodge class in Hⁿ⁻²(X, ℚ) is algebraic. Thus, if the dimension of X is 1, 2, or 3 the Hodge Conjecture is true. The Clay Mathematics Institute, and other drummers-up of the Hodge Conjecture as "a hard problem", just want to find proofs for "this" X, of 4 and higher.

As an abstract problem, it is only the existence question of algebraic variety—difficulty cannot be assigned. As far as its implications, Hodge is credited with a breakthrough in harmony mathematics; a monumental achievement.

The related 5 postulates were written twice: Greek, on the left page across from the same in English. If it is taken for granted that every angle is represented in "acute," "obtuse," and "right," the fancy letters are unneeded.

Hodge Theory, founded on this, has practical applications in TVs.

Sir William Vallance Douglas Hodge is famous for his work on harmonics seen as harking back to his predecessor Riemann. From his postulates, one can reach the more abstract Hodge Conjecture, which in maze notation can easily fill up an entire Bible-sized text with purely symbolic writing. Forming the planar geometrical origins for Hodge Theory, these were later described by Hodge himself as "crude in the extreme."

The English is:

This 5th postulate reads badly without its parentheses:
"And that if a straight-line falling across two straight-lines makes internal angles on the same side less than two right angles, then the two straight-lines, being produced to infinity, meet on that side that the is less than two right angles."

In Simple English, when the letter A's shape is drawn on this imaginary plane, the triangle inside has the same degrees as two right angles, and so the plane must be flat.

Hodge does not use the terms obtuse and acute, preferring to say "less" and "greater."

Pasanda

Pasanda () is a popular Shahi Moghlai meat dish in the Indian subcontinent. It is especially famous in North India, Rampur, Hyderabad and Pakistan. It originated from the food served at the court of the Mughal emperors. The word is an alternative from of the Urdu word "pasande" which means "favorite". The main part of the meat traditionally used in cooking is called pasanda.

Pasanda is usually made with leg of lamb or goat. These are cut into thin long pieces, flattened, marinated and fried with spices. Pasandas in Pakistan are usually made by cutting a slice of beef into thin, long pieces and flattening them. At present, pasanda is also made using chicken and shrimp. However, although the type of meat is different, the cooking process and the rest of the ingredients are usually the same in each case.

After the meat is cut and flattened, it is placed in a jar containing yogurt, chilli powder, and many spices and fries. The spices usually include cumin, chilli powder, cardamom and garlic. After a few hours of marination, the meat is put together in a cooking pot with a few other ingredients to make pasanda. Ingredients are onion, coriander, pepper, and sometimes cinnamon or bell pepper. Then it is slowly fried for 30 minutes to an hour. The food is then garnished with tomatoes or nuts. It is often served with white rice or naan.

Although the dish was invented by the Mughal court, its cuisine is probably inspired or developed from a pre-existing cooking technique. This is because a similar method of preparation for mansollas was described in the 12th century AD.
Although pasanda is usually served as a meat dish, it can also be prepared in the form of kebabs. Pasanda also refers to a light soup made with cream, coconut milk or yogurt and nuts, for its flavor and connection with nuts.

Hans Bethe

Hans Albrecht Bethe (; July 2, 1906 – March 6, 2005) was a German-American nuclear physicist.

Bethe made important contributions to astrophysics, quantum electrodynamics, and solid-state physics. He who won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis. 

For most of his career, Bethe was a professor at Cornell University. The notes of his classes are on nuclear physics and applications of quantum mechanics.

During World War II, he was head of the Theoretical Division at the secret Los Alamos laboratory that developed the first atomic bombs. There he played a key role in calculating the critical mass of the weapons. He and others developed the theory behind the implosion method used in the Trinity test and the "Fat Man" weapon dropped on Nagasaki in August 1945.

After the war, Bethe also played an important role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, although he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving it could not be made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and others against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign treaties limiting nuclear tests.

His scientific research never stopped. He published papers well into his nineties. He published at least one major paper in his field during every decade of his career, which in Bethe's case spanned nearly seventy years. Freeman Dyson, once his doctoral student, called him the "supreme problem-solver of the 20th century".

Jeera rice

Jeera rice or cumin rice is an Indian dish made from a rice and cumin seeds. This is the kind of food people can eat every day. It is a popular food in North India and Pakistan. It is easy to make, and it does not take as much time as making biryani. To make it, the cook needs rice, cumin, vegetable oil, onion and coriander leaves. Jeera rice is the name given to this dish when it is made from from whole jeera (cumin) used as the main ingredient with rice.

Jeera rice is a very common food and it can be prepared with very few ingredients. Cumin seeds are fried in hot oil. Long grain Basmati rice and salt are added to it. Rice and water are boiled with a lid by placing it on a high flame with water about twice the size of rice. The rice is then boiled over low heat until all the water is absorbed.

Jeera rice is usually garnished with chopped fresh coriander leaves, but in some Indian hotels and restaurants it is also garnished with round chopped onion.

It can be eaten without another item or served with raita, curry. In Indian cuisine, it tastes best with rajma curry, chhole, mutton curry as well as pulses of different cooking styles.
The cooking method of Jeera rice is not found in very ancient books or writings of Indian cuisine. Writings about this cuisine have been found in books and travelogues of the ancient Mughal Empire. The Mughals preferred rice dishes, and so the chefs invented new recipes for rice and experimented with traditional old recipes. This is how Jeera rice was invented. Later, it was adopted in Indian cuisine and became so popular that the cuisine has now become very common.


Alghoza

Alghoza is a combination of musical wind instruments. The Baloch, Saraiki, Sindhi, Kutchi, Punjabi and Rajasthani folk music artists play these instruments. It is also called Alghoza, Jōrhi, Pāwā Jōrhī, Do Nālī, Donāl, Girāw, Satārā or Nagōze.

This musical grouping first happened around 7500 BC in Mesopotamia. Then it reached Iran and eventually Pakistan. It had some changes on the way. Some old Mesopotamian paintings show a musical instrument very similar to Alghoza.

In Mesopotamia, this instrument was called "Al-Joza", which literally means, "the twin". As it reached Pakistan, the "J" in "Al-Joza" became "gh" and eventually the modified form of this instrument which reached Pakistan came to be known as Alghoza.

The Alghoza (Sindhi: الغوزو‎) is a paired woodwind instrument. It is traditionally used by Baloch, Saraiki, Sindhi, Kutchi, Punjabi and Rajasthani folk musicians.

Silambu

Silambu (; ), or Gaggara (Tulu: ಗಗ್ಗರ), is an anklet worn and used in many different ways on the Indian subcontinent.

According to Jeyaraj, the word 'silambu' is derived from the verb 'silambal', meaning 'to make sound'.

The silambu is filled with beads or small balls that make noise when the wearer moves or dances. It may be worn on the ankle or the leg. When worn on the leg, it is called "kālchilambu" in Tamil.

Some silambu are made of copper and use iron balls to make sound. Others are made of silver.

In Tamil Nadu, a traditional dance called Kai Silambu Attam is danced at the temple during the Amman festival or Navratri festival. During this dance, the dancers wear silambu on their ankles and also hold them in their hands. They have different styles of jumping in their dance. This vibration produces sound in the silambu.
Nautch and Kandyan dancers may wear silambu.
The main character of the epic Silappatikaram (a story of Silambu) is based on Kannagita's attempt to sell her anklet Silambu. The title comes from the name of the anklet.
Silambu are sometimes placed on cows' legs during the Pongal festival.

Isthmohyla calypsa

Isthmohyla calypsa is a frog that lives in Costa Rica and Panama. Scientists have seen it in between 1500 and 2100 meters above sea level.

Unlike other frogs, "I. calypsa" has spiky spines coming out of its head and back. It is bright green with some brown marks. Male and female frogs have different kinds of dark marks. This frog's throat and stomach are white. It does not have bars on its legs. It has large eyes and a short nose.

The adult male frog is 26 to 36 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 31 to 41 mm long. This frog has more webbing on its back feet than on its front feet.

Unlike other tadpoles, "I. calypsa" tadpoles do not have disks on their mouths.

This frog hides during the day and moves around night.

When it is time for the females to lay eggs, adult male frogs, adult female frogs, and young frogs will come to streams in the forest. Frogs usually come back to the same one every year. Scientists watching the frogs could not find the young frogs after a few days, but the adult frogs stayed.

Male frogs are territorial. They will choose one place to sit and sing and return to the same one for many years. Usually, they choose a plant hanging over a flowing stream. Male frogs are usually at least 1.9 meters apart.

The female frog lays eggs on the undersides of leaves, the side facing the ground. Then she goes away from the stream. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall into the water. Scientists only saw eggs on the tops of the leaves a few times. They take 270 days to grow into young frogs.

The female frog lays only one clutch (group of eggs) per visit to the stream, but sometimes she comes back and lays a second or third clutch.

Some insects, for example crickets, eat this frog's eggs. Parasite flies also lay their own eggs in with the frog's egg. When the fly larva hatch, they eat all the frog eggs nearby. Between 1991 and 1996, one team of scientists watched 615 clutches (groups) of frog eggs. 65% of them did not have even one egg that hatched. About a third of these were because of flies. Frog eggs can also die if they dry out.

This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives. It is also in danger from disease. A fungus causes the disease chytridiomycosis in this frog.

This frog is named after Calypso from Greek mythology. This frog has camoflage on its skin, and Calypso is good at hiding.

Scientists used to think this was the same frog as "Isthmohyla lancasteri" but now they know they are two different species.

The segment ends with all four getting their wish, though their stories interact with each other's without any of them knowing. It was set in New York City in 1932, and designed in the style of Al Hirschfeld's known caricatures of the time.

It originated in 1992 when director and animator, Eric Goldberg approached Al Hirschfeld about the idea of an animated short set to Gershwin's composition in the style of Hirschfeld's illustrations. Hirschfeld agreed to serve as animation consultant and allowed the animators to use and adapt his previous works for the short film. Goldberg's wife Susan was art director. Goldberg does allow the animators from the production hiatus of "Kingdom of the Sun" (which was reworked into The Emperor's New Groove) were reassigned to work on the short film. Duke is named after jazz artist Duke Ellington. The bottom of his toothpaste tube reads "NINA", an Easter egg referencing Hirschfeld's daughter Nina. John is based on animation historian and author John Culhane. Goldberg took Hirschfeld's original design of Gershwin and designed it to make him play the piano. Featured in the crowd emerging from the hotel are depictions of Brooks Atkinson, Hirschfeld, along with his wife Dolly Haas and Eric and Susan Goldberg. The segment was completed five months ahead of schedule from December 1998 to May 1999.

National anthem of Austria

„Land der Berge, Land am Strome“ (, meaning "Land of the Mountains, Land by the River") is the national anthem of Austria. It became the country's national anthem in 1946. The music of the song was originally thought to be composed by Mozart, but nowadays, different composers disagree. The words of the song were written by Paula von Preradović.

Nineteen days before Mozart's his death on 5 December 1791, he composed his last complete work, the „Freimaurerkantate“, to which the melody of the Austrian national anthem is sung. But nowadays, many people do not believe that Mozart composed the tune for „Land der Berge, Land am Strome“; instead, many people think that it was composed by or Paul Wranitzky. 

Before the Second World War, Austria's state anthem was „Sei gesegnet ohne Ende“, set to the tune of Joseph Haydn's „Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser“, which was the state anthem of Austria-Hungary. The German national anthem „Deutschlandlied“ uses the same tune, but with different words. The Nazis also used that tune, so to avoid being associated with them, singing that song was banned for some time after the war. Thus, a new anthem was created. The words of the new anthem were written by Paula von Preradović, who was one of the few women to have written words for a national anthem. On 22 October 1946, the song became Austria's national anthem officially, but at the time, it did not have words. Her words were added shortly in February 1947. On 1 January 2012, parts of the words were changed to make the song more gender-neutral (in a similar manner to "O Canada" in 2018).

Since the 1990s, there have been many times to change the words so that the anthem sound more gender-neutral. In 2005, Women's Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) did not like the words "sons", "fraternal" and "fatherland", so she demanded that these be changed. Austria's largest newspaper did not like this idea.

In January 2010, a female pop singer named Christina Stürmer presented a pop version of the sont „Heimat bist du großer Söhne "und Töchter"“ ("You are home to great sons "and daughters"") as part of a campaign by the Austrian federal ministry of education. She was sued for copyright violations by the estate of Paula von Preradović, but she was later cleared by the Austrian Supreme Court of Justice who called it "a mere modernisation" and allowed the version to stand.

Since 1 January 2012, a few words in the anthem are different from before. The text and notes of the anthem were officially put into writing in the „Bundesgesetz über die Bundeshymne der Republik Österreich“ ().

The last stanza was also translated into the Slovene language for the Carinthian Slovenes.

The same evening after von Preradović learned that the words she had written were chosen for the national anthem, her sons, Otto and , made a parody of them.
<poem style="float:left;"></poem>
<poem style="margin-left:1em; float:left;">Land of the peas, land of the beans,
Land of the four zones of occupation,
we sell thee on the black market!
And up there over the Hermannskogel
gladly the federal bird flutters.
Much beloved Austria!</poem>

According to media researcher , the first two lines were popular in the schools of Vienna in 1955.

Section 377

Section 377 of the British colonial penal code punished all sexual acts "against the order of nature". This law was used to punish people who performed oral and anal sex. This law also punished homosexual. The penal code remains in many former colonies and has been used to criminalize third gender people, such as the "apwint" in Myanmar. In 2018, British politician Theresa May acknowledged how the legacies of British colonial anti-sodomy laws continue to persist today in the form of discrimination, violence, and death. 

Although Section 377 did not explicitly include the word "homosexual", it has been used to prosecute homosexual activity. The provision was introduced by authorities in the Raj in 1862 as Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and functioned as the legal impetus behind the criminalization of what was referred to as, "unnatural offenses" throughout the various colonies, in several cases with the same section number.
Although most colonies have since gained independence through statehood since Section 377 was implemented, it remains in the penal codes of the following countries:

Slow-scan television

SSTV (Slow-scan television) is a way of sending a picture on radio waves, it is different from normal television because only one picture is sent very slowly, hence why it's called slow scan, instead of 24 or 30 pictures per second on normal television, SSTV is also not used for entertainment, although radio hobbyists may enjoy collecting pictures that they receive, or seeing if they can receive a picture from a very far away transmitter (DXing).

SSTV is also narrow bandwith, that means the signal is "thinner" it uses much less of the radio spectrum then normal television.

SSTV works by turning a picture into sounds, tones that represent the color and brightness of the lines that make up the picture, these sounds can be transmitted over radio and heard and decoded by other people.

Below is an example of SSTV audio
There are different modes of SSTV, which change the quality of the picture or if it's color, for example, a mode called B/W 8 is very low quality, but it doesn't take that long to transmit, whereas PD 240 is much higher quality, but takes a lot longer to transmit.

SSTV was first used by NASA to beam down pictures of the moon or from the space shuttle, but nowadays it's mainly used by amatuar radio operators and radio pirates, an amatuar radio SSTV picture will often have information on it about the station or person it came from.

The International Space Station still occasionally sends down an SSTV picture or series of pictures.
SSTV is also sometimes used in things that aren't radio, a video game called Portal had SSTV recordings hidden in certain locations, when people decoded them, they revealed more about the storyline in the game.

Beringian wolf

The Beringian wolf is an extinct population of wolf that lived during the Ice Age. It lived in Alaska, Yukon, and northern Wyoming. Some of these wolves survived into the Holocene. They were distinct from modern North Americans wolves and genetically basal to most modern and extinct wolves. They do not have a subspecies classification.

The Beringian wolf was similar in size to the modern Alaskan Interior wolf, or Yukon Wolf, and other gray wolves from the Late Pleistocene age. However, they were more robust, had stronger teeth and jaws, a broader palate, and larger carnassial teeth. Its strong teeth helped it hunt Pleistocene megafauna. The Beringian wolf mostly preyed on horse and steppe bison. It also preyed on caribou, mammoth, and woodland muskox.

Many of the animals that the Beringian wolf hunted became extinct near the end of the Ice Age. Cold and dry conditions were also lost. As a result, the Beringian wolf became extinct. The extinction of its prey has been thought to be caused by climate change and competition with other species. Populations of Beringian wolves were replaced by other wolves from the same species or genus.

The second growth form consists of twin leaves (sometimes three), and a single white flower with six (rarely up to nine) petals, typically measuring 3-5 cm in diameter. This flower matures into a yellow-greenish fruit, which can grow 2-5 cm long. The plant usually grows in groups in open woodlands, with individual shoots often connected by systems of thick roots.

Manipur bush rat

The Manipur bush rat (, ) or Hume's rat or Hume's hadromys is a species of rodent. It belongs to the family Muridae. It is found in Manipur and other Northeastern Indian regions. It is an endangered species.

The species lives only in Northeast India. It has been recorded from several localities. These are:

The Manipur bush rat lives at places with medium altitudes from above sea level. It lives in tropical evergreen, moist deciduous and evergreen forests. It is also found in secondary forests in Northeastern India.

The murid was described by Oldfield Thomas in 1886. The description was from specimens in the Manipur collection of Allan Octavian Hume. It was donated to the British Museum (Natural History) after Hume's life's work in ornithological notes were sold by a servant as waste paper. The Manipur Bush Rat was named in honour of him. The collection has two male and two female specimens. It was recorded to be collected on 23 March 1881 from Moirang in Manipur. It was the type locality for this species.

The specimen has been described by Thomas (1886) as:

The length of the head and the body of the largest specimen was that of a female. It was long. The length of its tail was long. Elsewhere, the head and body length has been given as head and body length as , the tail length as . The weight has been recorded as ranging from .
The species has been given safeguarding level (conservation status) of "Endangered - B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii)" in IUCN Red List ver 3.1. The rules for this rating include:

The main causes of damages to the conditions of this species are found to be loss of and destruction of home, separation, and overpass. Other than these, hunting and firing are also the contributing causes.

Depictions of nudity

Depictions of nudity include any images or performances of people without clothing. These images have been made throughout history, both in the arts and sciences. Nudity in real life is restricted in most societies, but visual images of nudity may serve recognized social purposes. In Western societies, these are art, erotic images, including pornography, and information or science. Any image not fitting into one of these functions may be misunderstood, leading to disagreements. One of these disagreements is the difference between artistic and erotic images.

The human body was one of the first subjects of art, and has remained popular to the present. The traditional fine arts media include drawing, painting, and sculpture. Because they are made of durable materials such a stone, ceramics or metal, older sculptures have survived to the present. Drawings and paintings have survived only in caves or other places protected from the weather. 

Works of art, such as paintings, statues, or photographs have shown nude children, or nude children with nude adults. For most of this history, childhood nudity represented innocence, and could be shown anywhere. In recent years, showing nude children in photographs is seen by some as sexual. When photographs were taken to labs for processing, those taken by families showing small children naked were sometimes seen as child pornography by the police. When there is no sexual contact shown, charges have never been sustained. In May 2008, police in Sydney, Australia, raided an exhibition by the photographer Bill Henson. This exhibition showed images of naked adolescents. The raid was done on allegations of child pornography.

Since the beginning of photography, people have taken photographs of nudity. At first, the photos imitated paintings to avoid censorship, or were sold as references for artists.

In addition to fine art, photography of nudity has also been glamorous, sexual and then pornographic.

As new media have appeared though history, the human body has been one of the most popular subjects.

Many countries have made laws that should protect children from seeing sex scenes on television by accident. That way, such scenes may usually not be shown during the day. British TV must not show such scenes between 5.30am and 9pm. The time when content not suitable for children may be shown is called "watershed". The Broadcasting Code requires that "Nudity before the watershed must be justified by the context."

Nudity is often used to draw the attention of customers to a given product. That way, nude people or people with very little clothing are often shown on covers of magazines, even if the content of the magazine has nothing to do with nudity. Naked people, sometimes in connection with body painting are used to distribute fliers at events.

This uses erotic stimuli, especially to people of the opposite sex. On the other hand, nudity seems to work all by itself in such contexts. Nudity in public places is rare, and people generally do not expect it. The more it is used however, the less it will act on people. At some point it will have become normal.

Nudity in Western theatre was once limited to models posing in imitation of works of fine art (called "tableau vivant"). Nude performers could not move while the curtain was open. The Windmill Theatre operated in Soho, London from 1932 to 1964, but could not compete after strip clubs were allowed.

Nudity in American theater began in 1968 with the opening of Hair on Broadway. Nudity on the American stage has become more frequent, but has remained controversial.

Nude ballet was accepted in Denmark in the 1970s, but performances by the Royal Danish Ballet in the United States were limited to New York City. Today, nudity has become one of the possible "costumes" for modern dance.

Public performances that have the intent of arousing sexual interest have a long history, perhaps as long as prostitution. Modern striptease did not end with performers entirely nude until the twentieth century. In the 21st century, sex on stage is allowed in some countries.

Photographic media may be used to create images of all types, artistic, erotic, educational and scientific.

Erotic images are those intended to arouse sexual interest.

Images of the naked body are used to illustrate educational or scientific information.

In the European Renaissance artists performed there own dissections of the human body and drew illustrations.

In the 19th century, photographs of naked Indigenous peoples became popular in Europe. Most claimed to be scientific, or ethnographic images. Whatever the intent, they became commercial (or erotic) images. It is unclear which images were posed, rather than being of everyday attire.

The deep space probes Pioneer 10 (launched March 2, 1972) and 11 (launched April 5, 1973) each carried a metal sheet with a "message of peace" for extraterrestrials that might find them. Both are the same, and include line drawings of nude male and female humans. The male has a hand raised in greeting, although its meaning would not likely be clear.

Manipur bush quail

The Manipur bush quail (, ) is a species of quail found in Manipur and other Northeastern Indian regions. It lives in humid and moist grasslands, particularly among tall grasses. It was first collected and described by Allan Octavian Hume on a mission to study about birds of Manipur in 1881.

"P. manipurensis" is listed as "Endangered" on the IUCN's Red List. Its home place is small, separated and fastly becoming smaller.

No one was confirmed of seeing the bird from 1932 until June 2006. In 2006, Anwaruddin Choudhury reported seeing the quail in Assam.
BBC News reported the speech of the conservation director of the Wildlife Trust of India, Rahul Kaul, as "This creature has almost literally returned from the dead."

There is a 1911 report by Frank Finn. It was based on Captain Wood's field notes of 1899. It noted that the species was common in the past. Captain Wood noted that the bird was commonly trapped by Manipuri people after bush fires. Further, he also noted the Manipuri language name was "lanz-soibol" (literally meaning "trap quail").

You Are Old, Father William

"You Are Old, Father William" is a poem by Lewis Carroll. It appears in his 1865 novel "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". It is recited by Alice in Chapter 5.

"You are old, Father William," the young man said,

   "And your hair has become very white;

And yet you incessantly stand on your head—

   Do you think, at your age, it is right?"

"In my youth," Father William replied to his son,

   "I feared it might injure the brain;

But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,

   Why, I do it again and again."

"You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,

   And have grown most uncommonly fat;

Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—

   Pray, what is the reason of that?"

"In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,

   "I kept all my limbs very supple

By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—

   Allow me to sell you a couple."

"You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak

   For anything tougher than suet;

Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—

   Pray, how did you manage to do it?"

"In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,

   And argued each case with my wife;

And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,

   Has lasted the rest of my life."

"You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose

   That your eye was as steady as ever;

Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—

   What made you so awfully clever?"

"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"

   Said his father; "don't give yourself airs!

Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?

   Be off, or I'll kick you down the stairs!

Trachycephalus dibernardoi

Trachycephalus dibernardoi is a frog that lives in Brazil and Argentina. Scientists think it might also live in Paraguay.
Scientists wrote the first paper about this species in 2008. Herpetologists Axel Kwet and Mirco Solé wrote it.


Officially, scientists first found this species here: "Centro de Pesquisas e Conservação da Natureza (CPCN) Pró Mata, at these map numbers: , at 950 meters above sea level, in the town of São Francisco de Paula in the state of Río Grande del Sur, Brazil."


Scientists wrote about the first sample this way: MCP 2422; an adult female frog that Kewt and Marcos Di Bernardo found on January 20, 1996. They put it in the PUCRS Museum of Science and Technology in Porto Alegre.


The genus name "Trachycephalus" comes from the Greek word "Trachy" for "rough" and "cephalus" for "head." The species name "dibernardoi" is for the last name of the frog scientist Marcos Di Bernardo. The other scientists named the frog after him because he found so much knowledge about the frogs and other amphibians of Río Grande del Sur. Di-Bernardo was a teacher of zoology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Río Grande do Sul (PUCRS). He and the other scientists caught the first sample frog. Together, they wrote the book "Pró-Mata: Anfíbios da Serra Gaúcha, Sul do Brasil", or "Amphibians of Serra Gaucha" in English. In 2006, Di Bernardo died of skin cancer when he was 42 years old.

This frog is very large for a hylid. The adult male frog is 57.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 77.6 mm long. The iris of the frog's eye is yellow. It has black lines that make a pattern coming out from a circle. There are four clear marks that look like petals from a flower. The skin of its back looks brown or olive in color. It has a pattern of marks that look like eyes and other patches. There are black and white bands on its legs. Unlike "T. imitatrix", it has a white parallelogram from each eye down its body.

Within Brazil, scientists have seen this frog in the states of Río Grande do Sul (towns of São Francisco de Paula, at 950 m, and Machadinho, at 760 m) and in the western part of the state of Santa Catarina (town of Seara, at 550 m).

It also lives in the most northeastern part of Argentina, in the province of Misiones, according to material from El Soberbio (departament of Guaraní, at 190 m). In those papers, the frog is called "Phrynohyas imitatrix". 

Scientists think this frog lives in many places. It lives no lower than 150 meters above sea level and no higher than 1100 meters above sea level through all of the Sierra Geral mountains and places nearby. Scientists think it could also live in western Paraguay and in the state of Paraná in Brazil.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), says this species is "not in much danger of dying out" in its Red List of Endangered Species.

Paul Winzer

Paul Winzer, also known as "Walter Mosig", (born in Cottbus on June 24, 1908 and disappeared after World War II in 1945 or 1946) was a German diplomat and policeman and one of the leaders of Miranda de Ebro's concentration camp (in Castille) during Franco's dictatorship. He was also the head of Gestapo in Franco 's Spain. 

He was born in Cottbus in 1908 and studied law at the universities of Breslau and Berlin, but did not complete his "Abschluss" - degree -; he failed final exams twice and failed to complete his studies. In April 1932 he joined the Nazi Party (member number 1,106,851). Shortly after the Nazi rise to power, in 1933 Winzer joined the "Schutzstaffel" (SS). Then he joined the "Kriminalpolizei" in 1934. 

In May 1936 he was assigned to the German embassy in Madrid, on the express desire of Heinrich Himmler to investigate the Spanish communists and anarchists. On 18th July, when the coup took place, going from what the fascists intended to be a "Blitzkrieg" to the Spanisch Civil War of three years, Winzer was in Barcelona, where he was watching the German leftists participating in the People's Olympics. After staying there for a few days, Winzer boarded an Italian steamer and returned to Germany. However, when Nazi Germany, which had participated in the war alongside Franco's forces, immediately recognized Franco's legitimacy, Winzer was again sent to Spain with the new ambassador, Wilhelm Faupel, as police "attaché" at the German embassy in the post of "Kriminalkommissar" .

After his arrival in Spain controlled by the fascist insurgents, he held various positions. Winzer oversaw Miranda de Ebro's Concentration Camp, built by fascist forces inspired by German concentration camps such as the one in his hometown, and in turn the Miranda de Ebro camp served as a testing ground for Nazi camps in Central Europe. Some authors point to Winzer as one of the designers of the structure of the camp, while others point to him as the designer of the entire Francoist concentration camps system. 

However, Winzer also carried out activities beyond his theoretical functions. For example, he cooperated with other embassy officials on plans to build a German oil refinery at Santa Cruz de Tenerife (in Canary Islands) with a view to using it in a future war; he was also responsible for the formation of the new political police ("politico-social brigade") of the Franco regime. After the signing of a police cooperation agreement between Franco's Spain and Germany in 1938 (which established the mutual extradition of "political criminals" arrested in both countries), Winzer's power in Spain increased considerably. After the end of the civil war, a later agreement further strengthened his power, and also allowed the installation in Spain of a network of "Sicherheitsdienst" (SD) agents under the supervision of Winzer himself. The network under his supervision consisted of around 30 agents who were spread across the entire Iberian Peninsula . 

After the end of the Civil War, Winzer remained in Spain and moved to Madrid, along with the German diplomatic delegation. When World War II began, he became one of the main contacts for Walter Schellenberg, the German head of intelligence and counterintelligence. As a police "attaché", his duties also included monitoring the German colony residing in Spain. Winzer, for example, always suspected of Delegate of the Ministerio de Propaganda in Madrid Embassy, Josef Hans Lazar, who, despite being of Jewish origin, carried out a major propaganda campaign in Spain in favor of Nazi Germany. Winzer's power also extended to Portugal, even establishing contacts with the police of Salazar's dictatorship. He even hatched a plan to kidnap and/or murder Otto Strasser, a former Nazi who turned against the regime in Portugal. In early 1945 he was still at the embassy in Madrid. After the end of World War II, his whereabouts are unknown. 



Data annotation

Data annotation is all about labeling or tagging relevant information/metadata in a dataset to let machines understand what they are. The dataset could be in any form i.e., image, an audio file, video footage, or even text. 

Data is one of the three key elements in the development of artificial intelligence. The development of computer recognition engine requires massive training data, which need to be annotated. These data include images, sounds, text, etc. Annotation of these types of data includes classification, frame, annotation, marking, etc.

Data Annotation, simply put, is the process of adding labels or tags to raw data. Think of it as giving our AI buddies a helping hand by making sense of the vast sea of information out there. It's like teaching them to recognize a cat from a dog in a photo or understanding the sentiment in a tweet. Without these labels, our AI pals would be lost in a world of pixels and characters!

Importance of Labeled Data in AI and Machine Learning:

Now, why does this matter? Well, labeled data is the secret sauce that powers AI and Machine Learning. It's the fuel that makes our algorithms smart and capable of understanding patterns. Imagine your favorite virtual assistant being clueless about your voice commands or a recommendation system recommending shoes when you're looking for hats – that's the chaos without accurate labels!

Growing Demand for Data Annotation:

Guess what? With AI and Machine Learning taking over the tech scene, there's an ever-growing hunger for high-quality labeled data. As the demand skyrockets, enter the superheroes of the tech world – the Data Annotation Platforms!

The Landscape of Data Annotation

"Overview of Data Annotation Platforms"

These platforms are like the Avengers of the tech universe, each with its unique superpowers. Some specialize in Image Annotation, meticulously labeling objects and scenes. Others are experts in Text Classification, deciphering the meaning behind strings of text. And let's not forget those skilled in Speech Tagging, giving voices a digital identity

Challenges in Navigating Data Annotation Platforms

But, navigating this digital Avengers world isn’t a walk in the park. Challenges lurk around every corner – finding the right platform that aligns with accuracy, affordability, and efficiency can be trickier than finding Waldo in a crowded picture!

Role of Data Annotation in Fueling Intelligent Algorithms

Despite the challenges, these platforms play a crucial role in fueling the intelligence of algorithms. They transform raw data into gold, making our machines smarter and more capable. It's like giving our AI superheroes their power upgrades to save the day!

The Need for Data Annotation Tech Reviews

Understanding Platform Strengths and Weaknesses

Now, here's where the plot thickens. Enter the stage – Data Annotation Tech Reviews! These are like the trusty sidekicks, helping us navigate the maze of platforms. They dive into the nitty-gritty, exploring strengths, weaknesses, and everything in between.

Key Considerations in Tech Reviews

But what do these reviews consider? It's a checklist of awesomeness:

Project Types: Does the platform groove with image annotation, text classification, or a mix of everything?

Workflow and Tools: Are the annotation tools user-friendly? Is there an AI-assist to speed things up?

Worker Quality and Training: How do they ensure accuracy and expertise in their workforce?

Security and Data Privacy: Is your data Fort Knox secure?

Pricing and Scalability: Can it be your tech buddy without breaking the bank?

Customer Support: Is there a tech wizard ready to wave their wand when things get tricky?

Flag and seal of Illinois

The flag and Seal of the State of Illinois are the state's official symbols. The seal is used on official state documents. The top part of the seal has the words "Seal of the State of Illinois" The date Aug. 26th 1818 (on which Illinois was declared a U.S. State) is at the bottom of the seal. A bald eagle is in the middle.

Secretary of the State Sharon Tyndale made an updated version for the seal in 1867.

The state's flag was chosen in 1915. It originally did not have the word "Illinois" at the bottom of the flag. But in 1969, the state word was added to the flag. The 1969 edition of Illinois' flag is the version that was used from then on.

First Chechen War

The First Chechen War was a war between the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and Russia from 1994 to 1996.

The war was caused by Russia's prior attempt to overthrow the Chechen government in the Battle of Grozny in November 1994. The initial campaign of the war saw the deadly First Battle of Grozny. Russia's major military failures during the conflict led to a rise of opposition movements against Russian president Boris Yeltsin.
Death estimates for the Russian military in the conflict range anywhere from 3,500 up to 14,000. The war caused massive devastation for the region of Chechnya and neighboring areas of Russia that continues until this day. The conflict also caused a rise of ethnic tensions between Chechens and non-Chechens in Chechnya.

In the aftermath of the First Chechen War, a rise of radical Islamic thought in the form of Jihadism began to rise in Chechnya. This ultimately led to the Chechen Civil War and later the pretext for the Second Chechen War.

Geoff Marshall

Geoff Marshall is a video producer and author from London. He runs a YouTube channel about transport. He lived in the United States from 2006 to 2009. 

Marshall got the world record for the Tube Challenge: travelling to all London Underground stations in the fastest time possible twice. His first world record time to visit the then 275 stations was set with Neil Blake in May 2004, on his seventh attempt. This beat the previous world record that was listed by Jack Welsby in April 2002.
His second record time of 16 hours, 20 minutes and 27 seconds, was set in August 2013. A prior attempt which came close was covered by BBC News as part of London Underground's 150 year celebrations.
Marshall wrote a show revealing his multiple attempts which he performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2014 and several times since at the London Transport Museum.

Marshall gives interviews on London TV and radio. He gives his analysis of transport stories.
He first appeared on TV in series 1 of ITV documentary "The Tube". The second episode shows his failed attempt to beat Jack Welsby's Tube Challenge world record. This was later followed in 2003 by "Race Around The Underground", part of Carlton Television's "Metroland" documentary series, where Marshall would have broken the record had the Richmond Branch of the District Line not suffered a signal failure.
He also appeared on Sky 1's quiz show "The Fanatics". He answered questions about the London Underground and then found himself in an episode of More4's "The World's Most Beautiful Railway" in September 2019 investigating the Caledonian Sleeper in the Scottish highlands.

Marshall was a publisher between 2013-2019 for Londonist Ltd, an online London themed company. One of the more popular video series is "Secrets of the Underground -" a YouTube series presented by Marshall that talks about obscure facts of the London Underground. The 17-episode series first featured the 11 London Underground lines, but later episodes were produced for other London networks and for bonus episodes.
Marshall's solo YouTube channel publishes mostly transport-related content in the UK. One notable series is "Least Used Stations", where he uses Office of Rail and Road statistics to discover which station in a given county had the lowest use in the previous year, then visits that station to review its limited features. He is also planning to go to all of the UK's request stops.
Other notable series include "Six Stations", "Tube Challenge", "London's Lost Railways", "Secrets Of..." other transport systems across the UK and "Geoff's Top Twenty" discussing favourite videos on the channel but is slightly inaccurate as 15 of them are from late 2021 onwards .

All the Stations was a project organised by Marshall and Vicki Pipe, to visit all 2,563 UK railway stations in the summer of 2017. The pair filmed most of the journey with daily updates posted on YouTube. They also posted updates to other platforms during the journey. An online hour documentary about the journey was produced in 2018.
