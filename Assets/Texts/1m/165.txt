"Billboard" magazine listed it at number 11 on their Hot 100 music chart. It was her first song to go above number 20 since 2016. The song was also listed at number 10 or higher on the charts in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.

Trainor sang the song on television shows such as "The Today Show", "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", and "The Drew Barrymore Show".

Meghan Trainor's first album, "Title" (2015), was successful. Three songs from it were listed higher than number 10 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 music chart. She faced problems while making her third album, "Treat Myself" (2020). She rewrote it four times to make it successful. She decided to go back to the doo-wop genre on her fifth album after her song "Title" became famous on TikTok in 2021. She had more feelings and became stronger after getting pregnant. This helped her write better songs. Trainor wrote songs for the album which she thought people on TikTok would like. She got attention on it after making videos with Chris Olsen. Trainor released the song "Bad for Me" in June 2022.

Trainor and Sean Douglas wrote "Made You Look" with its producer, Federico Vindver. Her therapist asked her to look at herself with no clothes on for five minutes. This and Trainor's low confidence about her body gave her the idea for the song. Trainor wrote the words "I'll make you double take / Soon as I walk away / Call up your chiropractor just in case your neck break". These are about how her husband, Daryl Sabara, turns to look at her when she goes out of a room. Other words are about the things he does for her. Trainor wrote more songs about self-confidence like she did on her older albums like her song "All About That Bass" (2014).

"Made You Look" is the second single from "Takin' It Back" (2022). It was given to radio in the United States on October 31, 2022. The song was sent to radio in Italy on November 18, 2022.

He plays the keyboards and percussion, Jesse McGinty plays the baritone saxophone and trombone, and Mike Cordone plays the trumpet. Jeremie Inhaber mixed the song, and Randy Merrill mastered it at Sterling Sound in New York City.

"Made You Look" is in the doo-wop genre and is similar to older styles of famous music. Vindver put the horn into the song to make this happen. It has many harmonies, and bass and brass instruments. Piper Westrom wrote that these are like the album "Title" in "Riff" magazine. "Made You Look" uses call and response; on the website "PopMatters", Peter Piatkowski thought it was like "All About That Bass" due to a similar delivery and the girl group arrangement.

The words of "Made You Look" are about loving yourself. Trainor makes the girls listening to it believe in their natural beauty and get more confidence.

He said "Made You Look" may not be a good song and he would not listen to it again, but he thought it made sense for Trainor. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the line about fashion companies in "Made You Look" showed that Trainor wanted to go back to the sound of "Title". But he thought this was not fully natural. "Rolling Stone" put it at number 69 in a list of the best songs of 2022. Tomás Mier gave it a good review. In the review, he said it was like Trainor's old songs and said good things about the words and production.

Some thought the song's words were flirty. Martina Inchingolo wrote in the Associated Press that Trainor sang "loud[er] and sexier" on the song. Writing for "Renowned for Sound", Max Akass believed she was fun and flirty on it. This made it an easy and effective pop song. Mier said Petras's part on her remix of "Made You Look" was "sexy".

It got 9.3 million listens next week and got to number 49 on the Streaming Songs chart. None of her other songs had done this since "Me Too" in 2016. It went to number 11 on the Hot 100.

We recorded it a couple of times in the studio and dumped it, and we were going to try it one more time, and I was fighting everybody . . . So we thought, let's start all over again, like we've never even heard it—completely change every part—and we did. Then, when it was through and all put back together, it was like a brand-new song."

There's a constant danger of rockfall and avalanches. It became known because many people tried to climb it (and failed). 

The first people to try climbing it were were Max Sedlmayr and Karl Mehringer, in 1935. People with telesocpes watched them. When they started, the weather was good. On the second day, they climbed what is called First Band; it was rated at the maximum difficulty level of that time. (VI). They reached the First Band of Ice, in the evening. They had climbed about , about were left (in height). Nearly the whole of the second day they spent traversing the second ice field. The weather turned, and the sight was lost. Three days later, the weather improved, and the sight was restored. Sedlmayer and Mehringer were spotted climbing somewhat higher up. The weather turned again, and the sight was lost again. 

Six days after they had started, a military plane was used to search for them, but it did not find the climbers. A team of eight climbers started a rescue mission, about four days later. They didn't find anyone.

Other climbers found one corpse, at a place that is now called Todesbiwak (Biwak of death). It is unclear,if this was Sedlmayr or Mehringer. In 1976, four Czech climbers found a packet of cigarettes, with a notice, Mehringer had written. It read "Biwack" and one of the names of the climbers. Was dated August 21, 1935. (The climbers had started on August 16)

In the 1930s, the north faces of Eiger, Matterhorn, and Grandes Jorasses were seen as the "last problems of the Alps". Among climbers, there was a race, who would first climb these north faces. Matterhon north face was climbed in 1931, Grandes Jorasses in 1935. At about Eiger north face was also the tallest of the three. In this attempt, two teams of wo people died. It is one of the best known climbings, and many movies have been made from it. Getting the corpses took more than a month. 
After the tragedy, climbing the north face was forbidden for a time. When it was again allowed, it was ruled thatthere would be no duty to rescue people who climed it.

Anderl Heckmair, Heinrich Harrer, Ludwig Vörg and Fritz Kasparek were the first who were successful. At the time, they were criticized, because their style was new. Also the Nazi parti did not like some of their opinions.
Today, there are more than thiry routes to climb the north face. With good weather, it is possible to climb the mountain in a few hours (using the route Heckmair had taken). The original expedition needed more than three days.

ChatGPT

ChatGPT (short for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot. It was launched by OpenAI in November 2022. The program is built on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 family of large language models. It has both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.

ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022. The website had more than one million users after five days. By January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users. It got attention for its answers in many areas of knowledge but its incorrect accuracy was said to be a major drawback.

ChatGPT used to be completely free for research, but it got so popular that OpenAI started using a freemium model. OpenAI created ChatGPT Plus, a subscription service which costs $20 per month. Users can still use the free version of ChatGPT, but users of ChatGPT Plus can use more features.

ChatGPT can be used to create computer programs called malware. Malware can harm other computers, steal information, or get in to networks without permission. ChatGPT can also make messages that look like they were written by real people which could trick people.

OpenAI warns users that the chatbot may give wrong information or have biased content.

ChatGPT can be used by students to cheat on homework or essays. ChatGPT can generate writing on many different topics, so students could use it to finish assignments without actually doing the work themselves. Preliminary evidence indicates that excessive use of ChatGPT is linked to increased procrastination, memory loss, and poor academic performance among students

Pre-existence of Christ

The pre-existence of Christ is the belief that Jesus did exist before he was even born. Before his human birth he was the fully divine person God the Son until he chose to be "made flesh" to then possess not one—but two natures—human and divine.

In John 17:5, Jesus talks about the glory that he had with the Father "before the world existed" and in verse 24, that the Father loved him "before the foundation of the world". 

John 1 opens with "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God..." this "Word" is later said to have been Jesus in verse 14 but just "made flesh".

The pre-existence of Christ is one of the most important beliefs in mainstream Christianity. Most mainstream churches that accept the Nicene Creed view the nature of the pre-existent Christ as the fully divine person called the Word, which is described in John 1:1-3; the verses read:

Russian soldiers put land mines on every road between Kreminna and Svatove to defeat Ukrainian attacks. Between 2 and 13 October, Ukrainian soldiers captured 14 towns and villages along the Kharkiv-Luhansk border. The largest of the towns captured is Borova. Ukrainian soldiers also went towards Chervonopopivka on the Svatove-Kreminna highway. However, they were pushed back from there by October 5. Two more villages were taken by Ukrainian soldiers on 24 October.

Neither side took much territory during November. Still, there were many battles going on every day. 

On the night of 2 November, Ukrainian sources claimed to have destroyed a Russian battalion near the town of Makiivka, in Svatove Raion. According to a Russian survivor of the attack, out of the 570 soldiers in his unit, 29 survived, 12 were wounded, and the other 529 men had been killed.

By early December, Ukraine had moved forward to the hills west of Chervonopopivka. In early December, Ukrainian soldiers broke through Russian lines near Chervonopopivka. Fighting was mostly west of the R-66 highway between Kreminna and Svatove. 

In December, many battles started along the line. Both Russian and Ukrainian soldiers made daily attacks.

Abundance of chemical elements

The elements are only a small part of the content of the Universe. By "elements" is meant ordinary (baryonic) matter made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. 

Observations suggest that "only 4.6% of the universe's energy makes up the visible (baryonic) matter of the universe". That includes the energy ("E" = "mc" ⇔ "m" = "E" / "c") in stars, planets, and living beings. 

The rest is thought to be made up of dark energy (68%) and dark matter (27%). These are forms of matter and energy are "believed" to exist on the basis of scientific theory and inductive reasoning. They are based on observations, but they have not been directly observed. Their nature is not well understood.

Most standard (baryonic) matter is found in intergalactic gas, stars, and interstellar clouds, in the form of atoms or ions (plasma). Degenerate forms are found in extreme settings, such as the high densities inside white dwarfs and neutron stars.

The inner planets of the Solar System are unusual because they have a high amount of heavier elements. These heavier elements were formed in earlier supernovae.

Aspect ratio of picture or display is the ratio between width and height. i.e.: If a picture or video has resolution of 1920 x 1080, That means the width is 1920 and the height is 1080. Now if we write them as ratio then these two parameters become (width:height) 1920:1080. Dividing both of them by the same denominator 120 it becomes 16 : 9. Which is ultimately the aspect ratio of the picture or video.

Anomalopidae

Anomalopidae (lanterneye fishes or flashlight fishes) are a family of fish. They have bioluminescent organs under their eyes. These light organs contain glowing bacteria. They can be "shut off" by the fish. It does this by either using a dark lid or by being drawn into a pouch. The organs are used to communicate, attract prey and evade predators.

Flashlight fish are found in tropical ocean waters across the world. They are normally about in size. Some species can be twice this length. They are nocturnal. The fish feed at night on small crustaceans. Some species move to shallow waters near coral reefs at night. Most species are deep water fish. This tends to make research of the family difficult. They are a poorly understood group of fish.

God the Son

In Christian theology, God the Son is the second person of the Trinity, which teaches that Jesus Christ is the Incarnation of God. God the Son who along with the Father and the Holy Spirit is of the same essence, share the same qualities, and each are fully God.

These three words: "God the Son" are nowhere to be found in the Bible, but are found in later Christian sources. At one time, a scribe made an error in one medieval manuscript, MS No. 1985, where Galatians 2:20 has "Son of God" changed to "God the Son".

The New American Standard Bible chooses to translate John 1:18 as:

Holy Spirit in Christianity

In most Christian churches, the Holy Spirit, or Holy Ghost, is the third person of the Trinity. The Trinity is a God made up of three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, who share the same qualities and essence and are therefore One God. Christians who don't believe in the Trinity have a big difference in their beliefs about the Holy Spirit.

In Christian theology, pneumatology is the study of the Holy Spirit.

Christianity came from Judaism. People who study the Bible often identify the Holy Spirit with the the Ruach Hakodesh in Jewish scripture. They think that Jesus was expanding upon these Jewish concepts. 

Christians believe that the Bible is the work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit revealed truth to the human authors. In the Old Testament the prophets were "carried along" by the Holy spirit when they wrote. Thus the scriptures are said to be "God breathed". The word for breath and spirit are the same in the Greek language. This is the language that the New Testament is written in. Christians think this means that the Holy Spirit helped the authors to write the Bible books. 

Jesus said that the Holy Spirit would "convince the world of sin, righteousness and judgement". This means that people know right from wrong, and they know that God will punish evil. This is God's way of bringing people to call on God for salvation. It is part of Divine grace.

The New Testament tells how the Holy Spirit relates to Jesus. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke and the Nicene Creed say that Jesus was "conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary". The Holy Spirit descended on Jesus like a dove during his baptism. After the Last Supper Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit to his disciples after he went to Heaven.

The Christian Bible says that the Holy Spirit comes to live in each Christian. He produces the "fruits of the Spirit", which are love, joy, peace, long-suffering (patience), kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control. The Holy Spirit also gives gifts to Christians. These include the ability to preach the gospel, having strong faith, praying for people to be healed, speaking in other languages and understanding them.
Some other gifts are teaching, being kind and helping people. Christians do not all agree about these gifts. Some Christians think that the supernatural gifts no longer are given. They say they were only seen in Bible times. Others think that these miracles still happen today.

Gwendolyn Brooks

Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks (June 7, 1917 – December 3, 2000) was an American poet and writer. She wrote about the ordinary lives of people, often in her own African American community called Bronzeville in Chicago, Illinois. In 1950 she won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for her book "Annie Allen". She was the first African American winner of that prize.

Brooks was born in Topeka, Kansas. When she was still a baby, her parents moved to Chicago. She lived there for the rest of her life. Her father was a janitor. Her mother was a schoolteacher and a pianist.

She started writing poetry when she was very young. Her mother told her to send some writing to the well-known poet Langston Hughes. He wrote to her, "You have talent. Keep writing! You'll have a book published one day." Many of her early poems were printed in the "Chicago Defender", a newspaper written for African Americans in that city.

After winning the Pulitzer Prize for her poetry book "Annie Allen" in 1950, she wrote a novel called "Maud Martha" that came out in 1953. This novel tells the story of the main character's life. In the book Maud Martha "suffers prejudice not only from white people but also from lighter-skinned African Americans."

From the 1960s on, Brooks' poetry said more about the problems caused by racism in America. Her book "In the Mecca" spoke about the struggles of Black people to live in their poor neighborhoods. She wrote about the death of Malcolm X. She was active in the Black Power movement.

Brooks was named the official poet of the state of Illinois in 1968. And in 1985 she was the Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. For these jobs she went many places. She went to prisons, hospitals and schools where she asked people to read poetry and to write their own poems.

She died at her home in Chicago on December 3, 2000.

Mann Act

The White-Slave Traffic Act, also called the Mann Act, is a United States federal law. It was passed June 25, 1910 (ch. 395, ; "codified as amended at" ). It is named after Congressman James Robert Mann of Illinois.

The act made it illegal to bring women or girls from one state into another for the purpose of "prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose," which means for them to have sex for money. The law was there to stop human trafficking. Most human trafficking was people taking young women from place to place for prostitution. The Mann Act was one of a group of laws about moral reform, during an era that was known as Progressive Era.

It had a problem though: the language used was often ambiguous or unclear. It was even used to make agreed sex between adults a crime. This was because people thought of sex as immoral if the two people were not married. Congress changed it twice, in 1978, and 1986, so that it would only be used for prostitution or other illegal sexual acts.

In the 19th century, in many American cities, people could only sell sex for money in some areas of the city. These were called red light districts. During that time, cities became more urbanized; also more women started to work. This meant that there would be more cases, where courtship could take place without supervision. In this environment, a concern of "white slavery" started: the fear was that women would be kidnapped and forced into prostitution. In 1847, Charles Sumner had described the Barbary slave trade. The ideas originally were from this description.

Communities started to set up vice commissions, to look how widespread local prostitution was. They also looked into questions, if the prostitutes were forced, and if cartel-type organizations ran local prostitution. These commissions also closed the brothels and the red light districts. The laws in the cities, which were liberal at first became more and more restrictive. Throughout the last few decades of the 19th century, there was more and more opposiition to an open prostution on the streets. The Federal Government responded to this with the Mann Act. The purpose of the act was to make it a crime to "transport [...], or aid to assist in obtaining transportation for" or to "persuade, induce, entice or coerce" a woman to travel. Many of the changes that occurred after 1900 were a result of tensions between social ideals and practical realities. Family form and functions changed in response to a complex set of circumstances that were the effects of economic class and ethnicity.

According to historian Mark Thomas Connelly, a group of books and pamphlets appeared announcing a startling claim: There was a conspiracy, which trapped white girls, seduced them, and forced them into prostitution, or 'white slavery'. These stories started around 1909. They often wrote about innocent girls "victimized by a huge, secret and powerful conspiracy controlled by foreigners", as they were drugged or imprisoned and forced into prostitution.

This excerpt from "The War on the White Slave Trade" was written by the United States District Attorney in Chicago:

Connelly says that these issues were real problems that had been there for a long time. The concerns simply made them bigger. These issues came from the fact that many young girls from the countryside came into the cities looking for work. Some of them became prostitutes, because they were well-paid.. A number of Vice Commission reports had drawn attention to the issue. Some people of the time questioned the idea of "abduction" and "foreign control of prostitution through cartels". Emma Goldman was a noted radical and feminist. She asked "What is really the cause of the trade in women? Not merely white women, but yellow and black women as well. Exploitation, of course; the merciless Moloch of capitalism that fattens on underpaid labor, thus driving thousands of women and girls into prostitution. With Mrs. Warren these girls feel, 'Why waste your life working for a few shillings a week in a scullery, eighteen hours a day?' ... Whether our reformers admit it or not, the economic and social inferiority of woman is responsible for prostitution." While prostitution was widespread, contemporary studies by local vice commissions indicate that it was "overwhelmingly locally organized without any large business structure, and willingly engaged in by the prostitutes."

Suffrage activists, especially Harriet Burton Laidlaw and Rose Livingston, took up the concerns. They worked in New York City's Chinatown and in other cities to rescue young white and Chinese girls from forced prostitution, and helped pass the Mann Act to make interstate sex trafficking a federal crime. Livingston publicly discussed her past as a prostitute and made the claim that she was abducted and developed a drug problem as a sex slave in a Chinese man's home, narrowly escaped, and experienced a Christian conversion. Although her claim was unsupported by evidence, her story exemplified the stereotypes used to pass the Mann Act—fear of foreigners, especially Chinese men; abduction and drugging in order to be raped and enslaved; a narrow escape; and salvation through Christian conversion. Other groups like the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Hull House focused on children of prostitutes and poverty in community life while trying to pass protective legislation. The American Purity Alliance also supported the Mann Act.

Battle of Bakhmut

The Battle of Bakhmut is an ongoing series of battles in and near the city of Bakhmut. It is being fought between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Russian Armed Forces. It is part of the Battle of Donbas. Shelling of Bakhmut started in May 2022. The main attack on the city started on 1 August. It started after Russian soldiers moved in from Popasna after the Ukrainians left the city. The main attack force is mostly made of mercenaries from the Russian paramilitary organization Wagner Group. The attack force also has regular Russian troops and DPR and LPR separatist soldiers.

As of late 2022, the Bakhmut front became the center of the war. It is one of the few front lines in Ukraine where Russia stayed on the attack. Attacks on the city grew stronger in November 2022. Attacking Russian forces were made stronger by units from the Kherson front and newly mobilized recruits. By this time, much of the fighting on the front line became trench warfare. Both sides have taken many casualties.

Bakhmut was where the 2014 battle of Artemivsk was fought. This battle was fought between Ukraine and the separatist Donetsk People's Republic. Pro-Russian separatists had taken parts of the city during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. A Ukrainian special forces unit and the National Guard were sent to get rid of the separatists from the city. The separatists were sent to the city's outskirts. Small battles continued until July 2014, when the separatists retreated from the area.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a main Russian goal was to take the Donbas region. This region is made of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The first attack to Bakhmut was done to encircle the Ukrainian soldiers at the Sievierodonetsk-Lysychansk salient. With another push from the Lyman direction, this would create a pocket and trap Ukrainian forces there. After the battles of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in early July, Russian and separatist forces took all of Luhansk Oblast. The battlefield turned towards the cities of Sloviansk, Bakhmut, and Soledar.

Starting on 17 May, Russian forces began bombarding Bakhmut. This killed five people including a two-year-old child. After the fall of Popasna on 22 May, Ukrainian forces left the city to help soldiers at Bakhmut. Meanwhile, Russian forces moved forward on the Bakhmut-Lysychansk highway. This put the remaining Ukrainian troops in the Lysychansk-Sievierodonetsk area in danger. The Russian checkpoint on the highway was later destroyed. Fighting continued on 30 May on the Kostiantynivka-Bakhmut highway. Ukrainian forces were able to defend the highway.

Bombardment of Bakhmut continued throughout the rest of June and July. On 25 July, Ukrainian forces left the Vuhlehirska Power Station and the nearby town of Novoluhanske. Two days later on 27 July, Russian bombardment of Bakhmut killed three civilians and wounded three more.

On 1 August, Russian forces attacked many settlements south and southeast of Bakhmut. Both the Russian Ministry of Defense and pro-Russian Telegram pages said that the battle of Bakhmut had started. The next day, Ukraine said that Russian soldiers had increased airstrikes and bombardment of Bakhmut. They started a ground attack on the southeastern part of the city. On 4 August, Wagner Group mercenaries got through Ukrainian defenses. They got to Patrice Lumumba Street on the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut. Russian forces continued to move towards Bakhmut from the south. The Ukrainian general staff said on 14 August that Russian forces had "partial success" near Bakhmut.

Night bombardment in the city center on 21 September burned the Martynov Palace of Culture. This was where the humanitarian headquarters was. The local fire department was also bombarded as they put out the fire. It reported that two SES staff were injured and equipment was damaged. At night, a five-story building was damaged by Russian bombardment. A Russian missile strike destroyed the main bridge across the Bakhmutka river on 22 September. This delayed civilian travel and Ukrainian military logistics.

On 7 October, Russian forces moved into the villages of Zaitseve and Opytne on the southern and southeastern outskirts of Bakhmut. On 10 October, the UK Defence Ministry said that Russian soldiers moved closer to Bakhmut. On 12 October, Russian soldiers said that they took Opytne and Ivanhrad, although these towns were still contested. Ukrainian sources said a minor counteroffensive on 24 October moved Russian forces from some factories on the eastern outskirts of the city.

By early November, much of the fighting near Bakhmut had became trench warfare. Neither side was able to move very far and hundreds of casualties were reported daily.

Russian soldiers captured the villages of Andriivka, Ozarianivka, and Zelenopillia. They moved forward through Opytne from 28–29 November. Wagner Group soldiers attacked Kurdyumivka, next to Ozarianivka. Russian soldiers also attacked Ukrainian soldiers southeast of Bakhmut. The same day, a Georgia military volunteer told the media that a group of Georgian volunteers had been surrounded during fighting near Bakhmut. The commander was wounded and five or six volunteers had been killed. On 6–7 December, the Russian defense ministry said that their soldiers had defeated Ukrainian counterattacks south of Bakhmut. The commander of the Ukraine National Guard's Svoboda Battalion said they were "fighting for every bush" and predicted Russia would struggle to go past a canal above and behind Kudriumivka.

On 9 December, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russia was "destroying" Bakhmut. He called Bakhmut "another Donbas city that the Russian army turned into burnt ruins." Former soldier and eyewitness to the battle Petro Stone said the Bakhmut front is a "meat grinder".

On 11–13 December, Russian sources said that Wagner Group soldiers had broke through defenses in east Bakhmut. They took the northern part of Fyodor Maksimenko Street in Zabakhmutka district. They moved along Patrice Lumumba Street in Bakhmut's industrial zone. They took the Siniat ALC factory and sparkling wine/"artwinery" factory. Wagner took Pidhorodne and made small moves towards Bakhmut from the south. On 11 December a railway bridge over the E40 (M-03) highway north of Bakhmut was destroyed. The Russians said the Ukrainians destroyed it to stop or delay future Russian moves towards Sloviansk.

By 13 December, Russian sources said that urban fighting had started in the eastern and southeastern parts of Bakhmut. They also said that 90% of Opytne had been taken. The Ukrainian General Staff said that they defeated Russian attacks northeast and south of Bakhmut from Soledar and Kurdiumivka, respectively. On 17 December, footage emerged online of trenches in Bakhmut's city center, indicating Ukrainian defenders were preparing for urban combat. On 18–19 December, Ukrainian forces counter-attacked on Fyodor Maksimenko Street and pushed Wagner Group soldiers back to the eastern outskirts of the suburban area. Soldiers on the ground were supported by Wolfhound (picture) armored personnel carriers; Those vehicles are a gift from Great Britain.

Ukrainian authorities said that they pushed back "five to seven" Russian attacks near Bakhmut daily.

On 20–21 December, President Zelenskyy made a visit to the Bakhmut front. There he met with soldiers, gave out medals, and gave speeches. Meanwhile, bombardment and fighting on Bakhmut's outskirts continued. Russian forces kept trying to break Ukrainian positions on the city's flanks. On 26 December, Governor of Donetsk Oblast Pavlo Kyrylenko said over 60 percent of Bakhmut's infrastructure was damaged or destroyed.

Color mixing

Color mixing means mixing two or more colors together. For example, mixing green and cyan makes the color spring green. It is not commonly taught to children, as it does not correspond to the mixing of physical substances which would correspond to subtractive mixing. Two beams of light that are superimposed mix their colors additively. The mixing of colored physical substances corresponds to an additive color and subtractive color mixing, hence it corresponds to our intuition about mixing colors.

To mix colors, you can use paint. For example, consider mixing red and yellow. Mixing the two colors makes the color orange. Orange is named after a species of citrus. When we mix blue and green, it makes the color teal. You can also mix red and purple, thus making magenta. However, if you mix red and magenta, they create the color crimson.


Average mixing can be confused with subtractive mixing. For example, even though red and blue average to purple, an attempt to make a particular shade of purple by mixing red and blue paint may fail, since there is no purple spectrum between the red and blue spectra. Paint mixing can result in average wavelength. For example, mixing blue and yellow usually results in some shade of green despite them being complementary colors, because there is a green spectrum between the yellow spectrum and the blue spectrum. It's also one reason why mixing red and blue along with white can result in gray, because red and blue average to purple, but the average wavelength is green which is a complementary color of purple.

Icefield

An ice field (also spelled icefield) is a mass of interconnected valley glaciers. It is also known as mountain glacier or alpine glacier. 

It lies on a mountain mass with sticking out rock ridges or summits. Due to ice's likelihood of being harmed or influenced by gravity, ice fields usually form over large areas that are drained by a river.

The higher peaks under the mountain rock that stick out through the icefields are known as nunataks. Ice fields are larger than Alps-based glaciers, but smaller than ice caps and ice flat materials.

An ice field is also measurable from an ice cap because it does not have a dome-like form.

Companies using this strategy need to record their costs in detail to ensure they have a good understanding of their overall costs. This information is necessary to generate accurate cost estimates.

Paper Planes (song)

Paper Planes is an alternative hip hop song by British hip hop artist M.I.A.. It was released on February 11, 2008. It is from her second studio album, Kala. The song samples the 1982 song Straight to Hell by British rock band The Clash. Because of this, the members of the band were credited as co-writers. The song also combines with African folk music.

The song did very well, making it M.I.A.'s biggest commercial success. It is because it reached the top 20 in several countries. This includes Denmark and the United Kingdom. It also peaked at number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Because of this, it made it M.I.A.'s first and only song to chart in the US top 100 as a lead artist.

There was a music video for this song. It was recorded by Bernard Gourley. It took place in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York. It depicts M.I.A. as an undercover dealer. It also features images of paper planes flying overhead. MTV censored the cannabis references and gunshot sounds in the song. This upset M.I.A., as she expressed it on her MySpace account.

This song also gained controversy. Due to the gunshot noises, it resembles M.I.A.'s criticism of the ongoing war crimes in Sri Lanka. Due to M.I.A. sharing ethnic tamil backgrounds, some have theories that M.I.A. supported terrorism. She was also a supporter of the Tamil Tigers. This also led to death threats.

William Styron

William Clark Styron Jr. (June 11, 1925 – November 1, 2006) was an American novelist and essayist. He wrote five novels and other books of essays and life stories (memoir).

Styron was born and raised in Newport News, Virginia. He had a hard time at a number of schools, but he graduated from Christchurch School in southeast Virginia in 1942. 

In college during World War II, he joined the Marines’ reserve officer training program. In July 1945 he was given a job to help with the invasion of Japan, but the war ended a month later. He soon left the Marines and went back to graduate from Duke University in 1947.

In the 1950s he lived in Paris. With other young writers, he helped to begin a magazine called "The Paris Review". 

During the ten years from 1951 to 1960, he published his first three novels ("Lie Down in Darkness", "The Long March", and "Set This House on Fire"). His fourth novel, "The Confessions of Nat Turner" was both popular and a problem. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1968. But many Black readers and critics did not like the book. The book was written in the voice of a 19th century Black man. They thought that Styron, a White author, did not understand the ways of African Americans.

Styron took more than ten years to write his last novel, "Sophie's Choice". This book looks at a character who lived through the Nazi death camp of Auschwitz. It was also popular and a problem. A movie was made from this book in 1982.

In 1990, Styron published "Darkness Visible". This book told a story of his own life, about having the mental illness of depression. One reason he wrote it was to go against an idea of that time that depression was a shameful thing.

When he died in 2006, one obituary praised him as "a courageous writer who in a long career never played it safe, either with himself or his talent."

Karl Heinrich Ulrichs

Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (28 August 1825 – 14 July 1895) was a German lawyer, jurist, journalist, and writer. He is said to be a pioneer of sexology and the modern gay rights movement. 

Ulrichs was born in the East Frisian village of Westerfeld (today in Aurich). It was in the Kingdom of Hanover at the time. His father was a Lutheran pastor. Ulrichs said that he felt different from other boys when he was young. He said he liked the bright colors of military uniforms and women's clothing. He graduated in law and theology from Göttingen University in 1846. He studied history at Berlin University from 1846 to 1848.

Ulrichs worked as a lawyer for the civil service in the Kingdom of Hannover from 1849 to 1854. He went to the court in 1853. He was an assistant judge in the court of Hildesheim. He resigned on 30 November 1854 after a blackmail attempt meant his sexuality was known by many people. 
In 1862, Ulrichs told his family and friends that he was gay. He started writing under the pseudonym of "Numa Numantius". His first five essays, named "Forschungen über das Rätsel der mannmännlichen Liebe" ("Studies on the Riddle of Male-Male Love"), said that gay love was natural and biological. He used the Latin phrase "anima muliebris virili corpore inclusa" (a female psyche trapped in a male body). Ulrichs made many words for different sexual orientations in his essays. These words include "Urning" for a man who is attracted to men (English "Uranian"), and "Dioning" for a man who is attracted women. Ulrichs also made words for the female versions ("Urningin" and "Dioningin"), and for bisexuals and intersex people.
In the 1860s, Ulrichs moved around Germany. He was always writing and publishing. He was always in trouble with the law for his words. In 1864, his books were taken and banned by police in Saxony. Later the same thing happened in Berlin. His books were banned in Prussia. Some of these papers were found in the Prussian state archives. They were published in 2004. Many of Ulrichs' most important books have been published.

Ulrichs was a patriotic Hanoverian. When Prussia annexed Hanover in 1866, he was put in jail for going against Prussian rule. The next year he left Hanover and moved to Munich. There he talked to the Association of German Jurists about the need to reform German laws against homosexuality. Later he lived in Würzburg and Stuttgart.

In 1868, the Austrian writer Karl-Maria Kertbeny created the word "homosexual" in a letter to Ulrichs. From the 1870s sexual orientation began to be widely talked about. 

In 1879, Ulrichs published the twelfth and final book of his "Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love". He was in poor health and left Germany for Italy. For many years he traveled around the country before living in L'Aquila. There his health got better.

He kept writing and publishing his papers. In 1895, he got an honorary diploma from the University of Naples. Shortly after this he died in L'Aquila.

Without You (Quavo song)

"Without You" is a song by American rapper Quavo. It was released on January 4, 2023, as a standalone single. The song is a tribute to Quavo's nephew and fellow Migos rapper Takeoff who was shot and killed on November 1, 2022. 

On November 1, 2022, Migos rapper Takeoff was shot and killed at the age of 28 during a party with about 40 to 50 people at a bowling alley in downtown Houston where he and fellow Migos member Quavo were at. According to the police, there was a fight over a "lucrative" game of dice, but Takeoff was just "an innocent bystander" and not involved. After Takeoff's memorial ceremony in Atlanta on November 11, 2022, Quavo wrote a post in which he recalled their shared childhood collecting WWE action figures and Takeoff's love of music. 

Less than a month before his murder, Takeoff and Quavo released their first collaborative album, "Only Built For Infinity Links", which was released in October 2022 under their group name Unc & Phew. On January 4, 2023, Quavo released "Without You" as a standalone single with the message "Long Live Take Infinity" on social media. It was not made available on streaming services. "Without You" was Quavo's first song to be released since Takeoff's death. The song was produced by The Zaytoven, Mike Dean, Elyas, and Eugene.

Musically, "Without You" is a gospel track. Jordan Darville for "The Fader" said the song is a "raw transmission of the memories, regrets, and hopes that have been swarming through Quavo's mind since Takeoff's passing". Grant Rindner of "GQ" described "Without You" as a "slow, pensive" track that was a "departure from the usual musical style of Quavo and Migos". Alex Hudson for "Exclaim!" said the song is a "soulful expression of loss". Aron A. of "HotNewHipHop" said that Quavo "delves into his auto-tuned harmonies for a heartbreaking dedication over Murda Beatz’s production".

The song begins begins with an intro from American rapper Vory. Quavo sings using auto-tune over a reflective, minimal beat with melancholy production. He sings about both the good and bad moments he had with Takeoff, including "smoking big blunts", performing live at Coachella, and growing up in Atlanta's Northside together. Quavo makes a promise that he will see Takeoff in heaven repeatedly throughout the song while singing over a gloomy guitar accompaniment. He then sings about "Only Built For Infinity Links" and makes reference to Takeoff's mother's suffering due to her son's death. He mentions that Takeoff's absence is felt most deeply around Christmas and birthdays, saying it greatly affected those who loved him. Quavo later raps about wanting to bring Takeoff back on a time machine, but knows it is not possible. Quavo ends the song by saying Takeoff's name in a long sigh before concluding, "Take, I'm sorry."

On the same day as the single, a lyric video for "Without You" was made available. The minimalist video was shot in one-take in black-and-white monochromatic and made in greyscale. The lyric video shows Quavo as he sits in a chair in a music studio, smoking a blunt while his eyes are closed and lost in his thoughts. His thoughts are expressed through lyrics that scroll across the bottom of the video. The video ends with the song's lyrics written on a piece of paper with Takeoff's name on the side that is folded origami-style into a rocket ship that blasts out to space, a tribute to Takeoff's rocket mantra. Amber Corrine of "Vibe" magazine called the video "simple, yet poignant" and said it has "emotional raw footage". Alli Patton of "American Songwriter" said the blunt Quavo was smoking was like a "votive candle to the late rapper".

Patton called the song's beat "haunting". Writing for "HipHopDX", Andy Bustard called "Without You" a "tender, somber track". "Clash" magazine described the song as a "profoundly moving experience, a naked exploration of sudden loss". Gil Kaufman of "Billboard" stated that the track is a "somber homage and a tear-stained list of cherished memories". The staff of TMZ claimed the song was "incredibly moving material". Jack Irvin of "People" magazine called the track "an emotional tribute", while Regina Cho for Revolt called it a "heartfelt offering". Matt Moen for "Paper" magazine said the song was Quavo's "more somber offerings". Sarah Kearn of "Hypebeast" called it a "moving new single".

Hanako (fish)

Hanako (c. 1751 – July 7, 1977) was a bright red koi fish owned by several individuals, the last owner of Hanako was Dr. Komei Koshihara. The name translates to "flower child" in Japanese. Far going beyond the average lifespan for her breed, she was 226 years old at the time of her death. Her age was determined in 1966 by removing two of her scales and examining them a lot. At this time, Hanako weighed and measured in length. Once the scales were fully and carefully studied, it was determined that she was 215 years old. In July 1974, a study of the growth rings of one of the koi's scales reported that Hanako was 226 years old. She may be, to date, the longest-lived koi fish ever recorded. There has been an argument as to the truthfulness of these longevity claims.

The average koi raised outside of Japan can be expected to reach 15 years of age, while the average Japanese koi's lifespan is 40 years. Some sources give an accepted age for the species at little more than 50 years.

VRChat allows users to earn trust ranks by spending time on the game, making friends, and making content. You start off as a Visitor when you make a new account but if you merge your account on the website you become a New User. Once you make a few friends you'll become a User. After a while spent making more friends or content, you can become a Known User or you can purchase the VRChat Plus subscription and get an automatic rank boost. Once you've been on VRChat for a while you can become a Trusted User.

VRChat lets its users create content for the game such as avatars or worlds. Using software like Unity or Blender you can make your own worlds and avatars. Recently to help with organization, VRChat added a Creator Companion which lets users add packages and sort their projects. VRChat is known for its many of popular worlds such as The Black Cat, Murder 4, etc.

Using third party software VRChat allows PCVR players to use Full-Body Tracking which makes avatars that support it use all of its body parts. On October 27, 2022, VRChat released hand tracking on Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro headsets. Using the front cameras on the Quest 2 and Quest Pro, it tracks your hands and fingers and utilizes them on avatars that support them and can replace the controllers.

VRChat allows users to purchase a subscription called VRChat Plus (VRC+) which lets users invite other users using custom pictures, have profile pictures and icons by their username, and recently allowed users who have the subscription to make groups, and gives you a higher trust rank or rank boost. You can purchase a month or a year non-renewable subscription for other users but you can only purchase a cancellable renewing month for yourself.

Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) was added on July 25, 2022 to combat malicious mods on PCVR. However, mods such as Avatar Search were also banned. EAC caused many performance issues to VRChat as some mods that helped with performance on PC and banned lots of other non-malicious mods.

Quadratic function

In algebra, Quadratic function is function that contains an expression where its degree (the highest exponent it has) is 2, which means that it is quadratic (See etymology). Its single-variable standard form isː

formula_1

When such a function gets plotted on a graph where formula_2, a curve that extends infinitely called a parabola will appear.

The word "quadratic" comes from the Latin word "quadrātum" ("square"). This is because of the presence of a number (which isformula_3 in the standard form) that is the result of squaring its square root (formula_4).

Macadam's ideas were built on the ideas of some earlier road engineers, like Trésaguet and Thomas Telford.

The Romans had not used a binding substance like bitumen. Their roads were nevertheless quite long-lasting.

Hello Again (The Cars song)

"Hello Again" is a song performed by the rock band The Cars. It was released on the 1984 album "Heartbeat City". It was the album's fourth Top 20 hit, reaching number 20 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart; it also reached number 8 on the Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart and number 22 on the Mainstream Rock chart.
The song's music video was directed by Andy Warhol, who also appeared in the video as did a then-unknown Gina Gershon. Keyboardist Greg Hawkes said "I think [Warhol] mainly did some of the conceptualizing and showed up to be an extra. And he invited his various friends to be in it. It was like any video shoot, but with a more interesting cast of characters. And you could always look over on the set and go 'Hey that's Andy Warhol.'"

The music video explored the controversial issues of sex and violence (mostly the former) being featured in music and at the time.
"Hello Again" was described as "eccentric" by AllMusic critic Greg Prato, who also cited the track as a highlight from the "Heartbeat City" album. Donald Guarisco, also of AllMusic, said, "One of their strongest tracks [on "Heartbeat City" with experimental roots] was 'Hello Again,' a stylish new wave rocker with plenty of experimental touches." Guarisco also said it "is a song that represents the Cars striking a unique balance between their gift for pop hooks and their love of experimental sounds."

In his review of the "Greatest Hits" compilation album, Greg Prato felt that "Hello Again" should have appeared, stating "why was the title track from "Heartbeat City" (an unsuccessful single) included instead of the 1984 Top 20 hit 'Hello Again'?"

Why Can't I Have You

"Why Can't I Have You" is a song by the American new wave band The Cars. The song, written by Ric Ocasek, appeared on the band's fifth studio album "Heartbeat City". The song is a lush ballad.
"Why Can't I Have You" was first released on the "Heartbeat City" album in 1984. However, in January 1985, the song was released as a single in the US, UK and Germany, making it the fifth single from "Heartbeat City" (the previous singles being "You Might Think," "Magic," "Drive," and "Hello Again.") Although it did not reach the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 like its four predecessors, the song managed to peak at number 33 in the US charts, as well as #11 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The song was the last single from "Heartbeat City" to be released in the United States; in Britain, however, a sixth single, "Heartbeat City," was released after "Why Can't I Have You."

Tonight She Comes

"Tonight She Comes" is a 1985 song by The Cars, from their "Greatest Hits" album. It was released as a single in October 1985, reaching number 7 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. It also reached number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, where it stayed for three weeks. It was The Cars' fourth and (as of 2010) last Top 40 hit.
It is a simple, diatonic pop rock song in F major, featuring a hard rock-style guitar solo by Cars guitarist Elliot Easton.

The solo was transcribed by Steve Vai in the February 1986 issue of "Guitar Player" magazine, as the centrepiece of an interview with Easton. In the interview, Easton described the custom-built Kramer guitar used for the solo, saying that the reason the solo was "so dense" was due to the four weeks he spent recording the single, giving Easton long enough to compose it.

The song's title is another Ric Ocasek double entendre, though, as Elliot Easton put it, "it doesn't actually say that she reaches orgasm. It could mean that tonight she's coming over to make popcorn."
"Tonight She Comes" was The Cars' fourth Top 10 hit. It was the first of two songs to be released as a single from their "Greatest Hits" album; a remixed version of "I'm Not the One", previously recorded in 1981 for the "Shake It Up" album, was the second.

AllMusic critic Greg Prato, in his review for "Greatest Hits" described the track as "playful", while Tim Sendra, also from AllMusic, said in his review of "The Essentials" that the song (among the others on that album), was "definitely essential". Critic Donald Guarisco said that the song "is one of their most straightforward pop outings and shows just how far they had moved from the acidic mindset of 'Just What I Needed' and "Let's Go. He went on to say that the track was "a delightful, pristine pop confection".

I'm Not the One

"I'm Not the One" is a song by the American rock band The Cars, from their fourth album, "Shake It Up". It features Ric Ocasek on lead vocals, Benjamin Orr singing the phrase "you know why", with the entire group repeating "going round and round" as backing vocals throughout the song.
"I'm Not the One" first appeared in 1981 on "Shake It Up". It was not charting at the time, but was included on the band's 1985 "Greatest Hits" album. The song was remixed on the "Greatest Hits" album, emphasizing the drum track with additional reverb. It was then released as a single in 1986, following "Tonight She Comes", also from the "Greatest Hits" album. "I'm Not the One" debuted on the "Billboard" Top 40 chart on March 8, 1986 and peaked at number 32.

AllMusic reviewer Donald A. Guarisco described "I'm Not the One" as one of "Shake It Up" "strongest and most memorable tunes", commenting that its sound still sounded fresh on its 1986 re-release, five years after its first appearance on "Shake It Up".

In 2005, the album "" was released on Not Lame Recordings, which featured a cover of Gigolo Aunts single "I'm Not The One.
The song's intro and choruses are in the key of B minor. The intro features two layered synthesizer parts, one derived from Ric Ocasek's vocal melody and the other a supporting countermelody in a softer key. The intro/chorus begins with a chord progression of B minor, F♯ minor, E minor, and A major, but is immediately followed by in inversion, F♯ minor to B minor, retaining the E minor to A major movement. After another "reversed" repeat, the E minor to A functions as a ii-V-I turnaround in the key's relative major of D.

The D verses are not unlike The Beatles' song "Dear Prudence". The official sheet music folio lists the chord progression as D, to D/C, to D/B (enharmonic to a B minor seventh chord), to D/B♭ (enharmonic to a B♭ augmented major seventh chord), and video exists of Ocasek performing the song, solo on acoustic guitar, according to this progression. However, other transcriptionists describe the chord progression as D to D/C, to G/B, to Gm/B♭, which is identical to the verses of "Dear Prudence". Either way, the last chord of the verse is a G minor sixth chord, transitioning to the chorus in B minor. Each verse is introduced with a guitar melody by Elliot Easton, who layers several clean-tone guitar parts over the synthesizer-dominated arrangement. There is also a horn-like synth solo by Greg Hawkes, played over the chorus progression.

Orval Faubus

Orval Eugene Faubus ( ; January 7, 1910 – December 14, 1994) was an American politician. He was the 36th Governor of Arkansas from 1955 to 1967. Faubus was a member of the Democratic Party.

In 1957, he refused to comply with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1954 case "Brown v. Board of Education". He told the Arkansas National Guard to prevent black students from going to Little Rock Central High School. This event became known as the Little Rock Crisis.

You Are the Girl

"You Are the Girl" is a 1987 song by The Cars, from their album "Door to Door". It was released as a single in August 1987, reaching number 17 on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
It also reached number 2 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 12 on the Adult Contemporary chart.
It was the thirteenth and (as of 2010) last Top 40 hit for The Cars.
Rhythm guitarist and primary songwriter Ric Ocasek shares lead vocals with bassist Benjamin Orr on "You Are the Girl". Both singers had recently hit the Top 40 with solo hits, Ocasek with 1986's "Emotion in Motion" and Orr with 1987's "Stay the Night".

The song was recorded during sessions for the band's last studio album, 1987's "Door to Door", during a time of personal conflict between the band members.
Following the album's release, there was public speculation that the band was breaking up, and within a year The Cars announced that they had disbanded.

"You Are the Girl" was The Cars' last Top 40 hit, although two more singles released from "Door to Door" reached the Top 100: 1987's "Strap Me In" (number 85) and 1988's "Coming Up You" (number 74).

Strap Me In

"Strap Me In" is a 1987 song by The Cars, appearing on their sixth studio album "Door to Door".
Like its predecessor, "You Are the Girl", a music video was produced for "Strap Me In". The video showed the band playing in a barren wasteland while a couple fought. It was also the final video the Cars made before they broke up, with the next video being made for "Sad Song" in 2011.
"Strap Me In" was first released on the "Door to Door" album in August 1987, opening the second side of the album. In September 1987, "Strap Me In" also saw a single release in America (as well as in Japan, Germany, and Australia) as the follow-up to the top-twenty single "You Are the Girl." However, it failed to reach the chart success of its predecessor, only managing to peak at number 85 on the Billboard Hot 100, although it peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. A follow-up single, "Coming Up You" performed marginally better, peaking at number 74 in the US.

"Strap Me In" was mentioned in the "" liner notes as the "standout track" from "Door to Door", which also said, "'Strap Me In' proved that [Ric] Ocasek could still turn an automotive double-entendre with the best of them."

Coming Up You

"Coming Up You" is a 1987 song by The Cars, appearing on their sixth studio album "Door to Door". It was written by Ric Ocasek and sung by Benjamin Orr.
"Coming Up You" was first released as the eighth track on "Door to Door" in August 1987. The song later saw a single release in the US and Australia, backed by the "Door to Door" track "Double Trouble." The third single from "Door to Door" (after the top twenty hit "You Are the Girl" and its less successful follow-up "Strap Me In,"), the song peaked at number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100 (a slight improvement from the performance of "Strap Me In") and number 37 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. Unlike its predecessors, however, it failed to chart at all on the Mainstream Rock chart.

The single was the last Cars single released before the band broke up in 1988 (although it was followed by "Sad Song" when the band reunited in 2011.)
"AllMusic" critic Mike DeGagne called the track the "most melodious tune [on "Door to Door"]" and went on to say it "was easily one of The Cars most distinct efforts since it doesn’t quite carry the same new wave/pop rock structure as the rest of their material yet relinquishes the same type of Cars charm." DeGagne continued, "'Coming Up You' is one of [the] bright spots in an otherwise faltering release as fans were still comparing "Door To Door" to the success of 1984's "Heartbeat City" album. After all of the tracks are heard on "Door To Door", 'Coming Up You' easily rises above the rest of the album’s lackluster fair, mainly because [Ben] Orr seems to sound more enthused and more interested than [Ric] Ocasek does on any of his songs."

Prose poem

A prose poem is a kind of lyric poetry that uses sentences and paragraphs, not the usual lines and stanzas of an ordinary poem. It is usually short. 

The language within the paragraph may have some qualities of ordinary poetry, such as figures of speech, repetitions, rhythm, and even rhyme. Often a prose poem will contain dream-like thoughts or ideas that do not seem to be rational. Emotions may be only hinted at or quickly cut off.

The term "prose poem" is an oxymoron because "poetry" is often defined as language that is "not prose."

Prose poetry probably began in Asia, in 17th century Japan with the work of Matsua Bashō. He created a form called haibun that combined haiku with prose. But in Europe it first appeared in France and Germany in the 19th century. The earliest in France was "Gaspard de la nuit" (1842) by Louis Bertrand. The most famous example may be Charles Baudelaire’s "Petits Poèmes en prose", or "Le Spleen de Paris".

Brutalist architecture

Brutalist architecture is a way of designing buildings. It uses bare building materials, and large block-like shapes, without much decoration. Some features are lots of uncovered concrete, rough surfaces, angular geometric shapes, heavy-looking walls, small windows, and mostly gray and brown colors.

An important idea is that "form follows function". In other words, when people look at the design, they should see the purpose. This is like other modernist architecture. However, structural and functional parts, such as columns, beams, and even pipes, are also important in Brutalism. These functional parts should be easy to see and stand out. Another idea is that each material should naturally look like itself. Brick should look like brick, glass should look like glass, and so on. 

Brutalism was popular from the 1950s to the 1980s. The name comes from the French term ""béton brut"", which means "raw concrete". The French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier was one of the most important Brutalists.

Priority Records is a United States-based record label, owned and operated by EMI, and has made a name for itself primarily in hip hop music. Priority has also provided distribution for other labels such as Ruthless Records, Death Row Records, No Limit Records, and Roc-A-Fella Records.
The Los Angeles-based company was formed in 1985 by three former K-tel executives: Bryan Turner, Mark Cerami and Steve Drath. Seed funding was provided by R-tek, a company headed by former K-tel board members: Ray and Harold Kives, and their company acquired an initial 50% stake in Priority. Priority bought out R-tek's interest in 1987.

To support early operations, Priority licensed others' repertoire and released compilation albums, but soon began developing its own roster of major artists. Priority was able to achieve unparalleled success as an independent label by developing an underground "street-based" marketing formula that set precedents and bypassed mainstream radio. His unique approach allowed Priority to sell millions of records without getting into the fiercely competitive battles of the major record labels for airplay. Priority's strategic marketing team was developed by Vice President Alyssa Pisano, who led Priority's Marketing and Creative Services Department from 1987 to 1996. Priority's roster featured numerous gold, platinum, and multi-platinum artists, including N.W.A, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Master P, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, Mack 10, Westside Connection, Eazy-E and Ice T.
In the early 1990s, the label entered into a distribution deal with EMI, while continuing to operate independently. EMI bought a 50% stake in Priority in 1996 and the remainder in 1998. Despite EMI's full ownership, Priority remained an independently managed company until 2001, when its operations were merged with EMI's main US subsidiary, Capitol Records. Priority was absorbed into Capitol Records in 2004 and ceased operations.
In late 2006, EMI revived Priority Records. The first act signed to the newly reorganized company is C-Murder (who, in the mid-late 1990s, recorded for the label through No Limit Records.)

A Thousand Suns

A Thousand Suns is the fourth studio album by American rock band Linkin Park. It was released on September 13, 2010. The album was written by the band and co-produced by Linkin Park vocalist Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin, who previously worked together to produce "Minutes to Midnight" (2007). The album's lead single, "The Catalyst", was serviced to radio and released to digital music stores on August 2, 2010. The band is currently promoting the album through the A Thousand Suns World Tour.

"A Thousand Suns" is a concept album dealing with human fears such as nuclear warfare. "On this record, the concepts blend human ideas with technology [...] Human fears, your fear of what's going to happen in the world, the music kind of references that", said Mike Shinoda on an interview with MTV. The album's title comes from the Hindu Sanskrit scripture, the "Bhagavad Gita": "If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one," a quote made famous by J. Robert Oppenheimer in reference to the atomic bomb.

Although commercially successful, the album received mixed reviews upon release. The album as a whole has been compared to a progressive rock album, and compared to Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon" and Radiohead's "Kid A".
Recording for the album began in 2008, shortly after the release of "Minutes to Midnight". In November 2008 Chester Bennington stated this "sound[ed] a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." In May 2009, a story was published in a "Billboard" magazine where Shinoda revealed information about the album. "I feel like we've been writing a lot. I'd say we've got about half the music done, though I shouldn't say halfway because who knows how long the next batch of songs will take. But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation and for the rest of the week we just go and work on whatever we find exciting." He also explained the experimentation the band would be working with. "It's not going to be "Hybrid Theory." It's not going to be "Minutes to Midnight." And if we do it right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there."

Drummer Rob Bourdon referred to himself and the band as "perfectionists" when asked about the new project. "We tend to be perfectionists and its sort of how we work, We like being in the studio and when we get in there we write a ton of material." Bourdon admitted that the album was challenging to complete. "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also have a lot of fun in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging."
In an interview with "Rolling Stone" in May 2009, Shinoda revealed that the band was in the process of writing and recording material for the album. The album was originally slated for an early 2010 release, but Shinoda was very concerned about "the quality of the tunes" stating that "if we need to take a step back and make sure everything is top, top quality by our standards, we will." Shinoda also stated that, comparing to "Minutes to Midnight", the new album would have a larger "thread of consistency" and would be more experimental and "hopefully more cutting-edge".

The album's style has been compared to the music of Pink Floyd and contains the high-pitched sonar "ping" from Pink Floyd's "Echoes" at the end of "Robot Boy" and continuing into "Jornada del Muerto".

It has also been stated that the album honours the hip-hop group Public Enemy. On the song "Wretches and Kings", Shinoda stated "There is a homage to Chuck D on there. It's probably the most hip-hop song on the record and one of the most aggressive... Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively." The first line of the first and second verse ("To save face, how low can you go?" and "So keep face, how slow can you go?") are references to one of Public Enemy's most famous songs "Bring The Noise", which open its first verse with "Bass! How low can you go?" in a melodically similar way. The album also features speech samples by American political figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Mario Savio.

"When it came to doing things that felt very much like older Linkin Park, like mixing hip-hop with a rock chorus, [we] felt like, if we were going to do it, we need to really do it in a way that felt natural and felt original and felt like it was something we hadn't done in the past," said Chester Bennington in an interview with MTV News who referred to Linkin Park's new style as less technical and more organic: "[While] there are hip-hop songs on the album - 'Wretches and Kings', 'When They Come for Me' — they're like nothing the band have tried before: snarling, raw, dark and [...] strangely organic."

Austrian people

Austrians () are the citizens and nationals of Austria. The English term "Austrians" was used for the population of Habsburg Austria from the 17th or 18th century. During the 19th century, it was for the citizens of the Empire of Austria (1804–1867). From 1867 until 1918, it was used for the citizens of Cisleithania. The term "Austria" first referred to the historical March of Austria. This was mostly the Vienna Basin in what is today Lower Austria.

Living Things

Living Things is the fifth studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released through Warner Bros. Records on 26 June 2012. The album was produced by Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin, and presented a new direction in Linkin Park's music, combining the hard rock sounds of their debut album, "Hybrid Theory" and the electronic mixes of their very successful previous studio album, "A Thousand Suns", whilst keeping a brand new, original sound.
In June 2011, Bennington revealed to "Kerrang!" that Linkin Park has started working on new material for their next album. He explained, "We've been working on a new record for the past two months. The music is great and we're well ahead of where we're expecting to be. There aren't a whole lot of noises going on, but there are a lot of good songs."

Rick Rubin produced the album. "Typically we'll have a once-a-week meeting to go listen to the songs that they're coming up with and talk about them. For so early in the project, they are much further along than they have been on the last two albums we did. On "A Thousand Suns" there were still a lot of irons in the fire. We knew, 'OK, we can't do this forever. Let's leave this batch and we'll come back and address it when we start up again, Rubin said.

In July 2011, Bennington told "Rolling Stone" that Linkin Park aimed to produce a new album every eighteen months, and that he would be shocked if a new album did not come out in 2012. The band continued to record and produce new material even while on tour. Bennington commented on Linkin Park's schedule, stating, "Touring for two years is excruciating. When we would tour for two years even the most resilient person in the band, at the end of that, was fucking miserable." He further elaborated on their ideas in an interview with MTV saying, "We do have a really great head start. We've got some great music, some good ideas. The creativity has continued to flow for us for the last few years, consistently." He later revealed in another interview in September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the next album, saying "We just kind of began. We like to keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the time...we like the direction that we're going in."

Live in Texas

Live in Texas is Linkin Park's first live album and third DVD (after "Frat Party at the Pankake Festival" and "The Making of Meteora"), released on November 18, 2003.
The DVD comes with a bonus CD that features twelve of the songs from the DVD. The other five live tracks can be found on the "Linkin Park Underground V3.0" CD. The audio on the CD is mixed differently than the DVD audio. The DVD/CD comes in two versions: a CD box and, although harder to find, a DVD box.

The concert footage was filmed on August 2 and August 3 during the 2003 Summer Sanitarium Tour at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas and Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas.

The video footage is comprised of the audio from the Dallas show and video from both the Houston and Dallas shows; because of this, the band had to wear the same clothes on two shows, although there are still noticeable differences. For example, Mike Shinoda could be seen wearing two similar but different shirts, Brad Delson's guitar sometimes changes multiple times in the middle of songs from a red PRS to a black Ibanez, even though there is no break in the guitar, as well as lead singer Chester Bennington's shirt drenched in sweat and completely dry the next time he's shown on screen.

Curb's roster includes several country music artists, including Tim McGraw, LeAnn Rimes, and Hank Williams, Jr. In late 2002, Curb Records also acquired a stake in Word Records from then-owners Time Warner. Curb still has a stake in Word even though Time Warner's stake was sold to the newly formed spin-off Warner Music Group in 2004.

2006 GMA Music Award Female Vocalist of the Year Natalie Grant signed with Curb Records. Former American Idol Kimberley Locke is also a member of the Curb roster.

In 2006, Curb launched a sister imprint, Bruc Records, whose name is an acronym for "Blues, Rock, Urban, Country" (the name is also "Curb" spelled backwards). Hank III's third studio release, "Straight to Hell", was the first album to be released on the new label.

Curb Records supports charitable programs through the Mike Curb Family Foundation. Some of the supported programs include; the Mike Curb Family Welcome Centre at Second Harvest, Curb Youth Symphony, Curb Young Musicians Competition, Curb Concerto Competition, Curb Family Music Education Centre at the Nashville Symphony, and the Nashville Alliance For Public Education.

In January 2006, Curb scored a top ten hit with Brian Kennedy and Peter Corry's "Tribute to George Best", an EP featuring recordings of "You Raise Me Up" amongst others.

Vanguard Records

Vanguard Records is a record label founded in 1950 by brothers Maynard and Seymour Solomon in New York. It started as a classical music label, but is perhaps best known for its catalogue of recordings by several seminal folk and blues artists from the 1960s; Bach Guild was a subsidiary label.
In 1953, under the direction of John Hammond, the company began the "Jazz Showcase" series concentrating on the idiom of mainstream jazz, producing around two dozen recordings before it closed about 1958. The recordings made at the Spirituals to Swing concerts in 1938 and 1939 were finally released by Vanguard in 1959. Thereafter the company only continued to record Jazz and Blues on and off. 

Vanguard branched out in the mid-1950s by defying the blacklist and signing blacklisted artist Paul Robeson and The Weavers. The company continued to issue folk music with newly signed artists including Joan Baez, Hedy West, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Country Joe and the Fish, Ian and Sylvia, Mimi and Richard Fariña. 

In the summer of 1965, Maynard Solomon hired Samuel Charters to edit the 1964 Newport Folk Festival tapes. Following that project, the company sent Charters to Chicago to tape the wide range of blues musicians there. Those sessions resulted in the classic 1966 three-album series titled "Chicago/The Blues/Today!", which introduced a new generation to the blues. The albums included sets by Junior Wells with Buddy Guy, Muddy Water's bandmates Otis Spann and James Cotton, Otis Rush, Homesick James, Johnny Shines, Big Walter Horton, and Charlie Musselwhite.

Vanguard released a series of important classical recordings, both domestically produced and imported. Many of the latter came from the British label Pye Records label, with performances by the Halle Orchestra conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. The recordings were so exceptional in their stereo sound and overall quality that many classical radio stations played them. Vanguard even released some classical quadraphonic recordings in the early 1970s, including a performance of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony with the American Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The label also released many performances by the Utah Symphony Orchestra conducted by Maurice Abravanel, as well as the earlier P.D.Q. Bach recordings, from 1965 to 1983. Vanguard was the first US label to issue the complete 1944 hi-fi recordings of composer Richard Strauss conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in most of his symphonic poems; the recordings were made on the Magnetophon tape recording equipment in the Vienna Opera House.

In the early 1970s, Indian classical musician and sarod virtouso Vasant Rai was signed exclusively by Vanguard. Vanguard put out 5 hit albums of Vasant Rai. That time, Vanguard released albums by Michigan-based rock groups such as Dick Wagner and The Frost and was inspired by a novelty hit they released, Benny Bell's "Shaving Cream" to release albums of humorous music inspired by Dr. Demento. Tom Paxton recorded two albums, "New Songs from the Briarpatch" and "Heroes", on Vanguard Records in the late 1970s.

The label lay dormant for most of the mid-to-late 1970s, briefly resurfacing with a few disco releases in the 1980s, and was finally sold to the Welk Music Group in 1985. The Welk Group sold the classical music catalogue back to Seymour Solomon. Welk Music Group revitalized the label, reissuing much of its extensive catalogue of folk and popular music (much of which had been out of print for several years) on CD, as well as signing several new artists (such as Mindy Smith), along with established artists (such as Edwin McCain, Hootie & the Blowfish, Blues Traveler, Shawn Mullins, Chely Wright and more). 
Vanguard Classics was sold after Seymour Solomon's death to Artemis Records, which reactivated the company with new releases from Leon Fleisher and Gil Shaham. When Artemis closed in 2004, the Vanguard Classics catalogue was sold to Sheridan Square Entertainment, which licenses Vanguard Classics material with no apparent plans to relaunch or reactivate the label.

Alternative dance

Alternative dance (also known as underground dance in the US) is a musical genre that mixes the "melodic song structure of alternative and indie rock with the electronic beats, synths and/or samples, and club orientation of post-disco dance music". "The Sacramento Bee" calls it "postmodern–Eurosynth–technopop–new wave in a blender". The genre draws heavily on club culture for inspiration, while also incorporating other styles of music such as synth pop, acid house, and trip-hop. Alternative dance artists identify more closely with their music through a distinctive style, texture, or fusion of specific musical elements. They are usually signed with small labels.

Most alternative dance artists are British, "owing to the greater prominence of the UK's club and rave scenes in underground musical culture". AllMusic cites New Order as the first group in the genre due to their 1982–1983 recordings, which fused post-punk with synth pop in the style of the German collective Kraftwerk. Alternative dance had a huge impact on the British Madchester scene of the late 1980s and the trip-hop and rave scenes of the 1990s. The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers are two prominent examples of the British scene of the 1990s, while in the US, Chicago's Liquid Soul to San Francisco's Dubtribe expanded dance music "beyond its old identity as a singles-driven genre with no identifiable, long-term artists". The American scene rarely received radio airplay and most of the ground-breaking work continued underground or was imported. The Prodigy's third studio album "The Fat of the Land" was the first international alternative dance hit to debut on number one in 25 countries, including the US.

In the song, Rihanna sings only the chorus and one verse, while Sean Paul sings all rest of the song. 

"Break It Off" was performed in many different venues and settings all over the world. She performed it on New Year's Eve 2007 and at many concerts such as BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend and Live Earth. It is performed for a minute and a half at concerts as a medley because Sean Paul performs more words than Rihanna.

E. Kidd Bogart

E. Kidd Bogart (born January 23, 1978 in Los Angeles, California) is a multi-faceted American music executive and songwriter who has contributed to a long list of internationally successful artists. He is the son of Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart and music manager Joyce Bogart-Trabulus, who managed KISS and Donna Summer. 
From a very young age he wanted to carry on the family tradition and began working at Interscope Records as an intern when he was 16 years old. Former Interscope Records president Tom Whalley took a chance on him when Bogart turned 18 and promoted him into the A&R department. Under Whalley's supervision, Bogart helped coordinate of various projects, most notably for 2Pac as a project coordinator and hip-hop icon Eminem as an A&R. It was also widely reported that Bogart was responsible for finding and bringing Eminem into Interscope Records. 

By the age of 21, Bogart had transitioned into management while working as an A&R consultant for Warner Bros. Records. In his managerial career, he formed the now-defunct BAT Management with partners Walter "Walt Liquor" Taylor and Jordan Feldstein. Under BAT Management and along with other managers Joseph "3H" Weinberger, Justin Trugman and Todd Bird, he was responsible for and/or assisted in the careers of Grammy Award winning Maroon 5 (then known as Kara's Flowers), Planet Asia, Mystic, Styles of Beyond and various other artists. Bogart played an integral role in Maroon 5 signing with Octone Records with Feldstein, who still manages the band.

In 2002, Bogart founded Casbah Artists Management with his then-wife Cheryl Costanzo (now divorced), in tribute to his late father. Under Casbah, Bogart managed former Dreamworks recording artist Vishiss. During the making of the record, Bogart met future collaborator J. R. Rotem, a producer on the record.

In the summer of 2004, Bogart began working for the Agency for the Performing Arts as an Agent in the Concerts Department. In 2006, Bogart's APA roster included OneRepublic, The Outline, DJ Graham Funke, DJ Stonerokk and Planet Asia, among others. 

While working at the agency, Bogart, inspired by Costanzo to do so, developed an all-female R&B trio called Raw Candy. Bogart then teamed up with Rotem and music executive Zach Katz and the three created a look and sound for the girls. Bogart was largely responsible for the artistic vision and writing the songs, Rotem for producing and composing the songs, and Katz as the business executive. 

After failing to garner significant interest for the group, Bogart, Rotem and Katz released the girls from their contract and made deals for Bogart/Rotem-penned compositions for other major record-label projects, most notably the number-one hit "SOS", performed by Rihanna. In 2006, as Bogart's song writing began to be more in demand, he left the Agency to pursue writing full-time.

He has written for artists and groups such as Sean Kingston, Britney Spears, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez, Natasha Bedingfield, Blake Lewis, Paula DeAnda, Ashley Tisdale, Mýa, Paris Hilton, Jesse McCartney, Hayden Panettiere, NLT, Brandy, Wynter Gordon, Paula Deanda, Nick Lachey, Donna Summer, Jessi Malay, Jordyn Taylor, Nikki Flores, Lalaine, Kesha, The Veronicas, Corbin Bleu, Lucy Walsh, The Cheetah Girls, Keke Palmer, Hilary Duff, Varsity Fanclub, Frankie J, Heidi Montag, Steph Jones, Sophia Fresh and Christina Milian, among others. He currently resides in Los Angeles, where he creates most of his music at Rotem's Chalice Studio C and The Writing Camp's Campground Studios.

In 2006, Rotem founded his own record and publishing label, Beluga Heights, along with manager Zach Katz and hired Bogart as head writer. Bogart co-wrote four songs on the debut album from Beluga Heights first artist Sean Kingston, including the Top 10 smash "Take You There". In 2008 it was reported that 2 of the tracks on Donna Summer's release "Crayons" had been co-written by Bogart.

Bogart recently joined forces with songwriters David "DQ" Quiñones and Erika Nuri to form The Writing Camp, a writing team based in Hollywood, California. The Writing Camp, along with Victoria Horn and Rodney Jerkins, wrote Brandy's debut single "Right Here (Departed)" from her 2008 album "Human". Chosen as the album's leading single and Brandy's first release with Epic Records, following her split from Atlantic Records in 2005, the song was released via Brandy's official website on August 13, 2008.

Praça dos Três Poderes

Praça dos Três Poderes (; literally "Three Powers Plaza") is a plaza in Brasília, the capital of Brazil. The name comes from the fact that the buildings having the Executive, represented by the Palácio do Planalto (presidential office); the Legislative represented by the Congresso Nacional (National Congress); and the Judiciary, represented by the Supremo Tribunal Federal (Supreme Federal Court) are in this plaza.

The plaza was designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer.

On 8 January 2023, the plaza was invaded by supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro.

2023 invasion of the Brazilian Congress

On 8 January 2023, after the victory of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the 2022 Brazilian general election, supporters of the former president, Jair Bolsonaro, attacked the Supreme Court of Brazil, the National Congress of Brazil and the Planalto Presidential Palace in the Praça dos Três Poderes plaza in Brasília, the federal capital. The protesters had entered the Chamber of Deputies's Green Hall and tried invade the Planalto Palace. Lula was not in Brasília at the time of the attack.

The event was compared to when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed and attacked the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. 

The attack happened a week after Lula's inauguration and after many weeks of unrest from Bolsonaro's supporters. The Supreme Court, Congress, and Presidential Palace were reported as cleared later that evening. That same day, Lula announced that he had signed a decree allowing a federal state of emergency in the Federal District through the end of January. Brazilian security forces cleared all three buildings later that night. At the time of the attack, Bolsonaro was in the United States.

During the attack, many works of art, like paintings, vases and historical objects were damaged, stolen or destroyed during the attack. In the Planalto, former president Juscelino Kubitschek's desk was destroyed. A copy of the original 1988 constitution book was initially taken by a protester, but was later found near the building of the Supreme Federal Court. 

The offices of the Workers' Party and of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party in the Congress building were also invaded and vandalized by the mob. Rioters urinated and defecated in the press areas of the Congress building.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva called the attackers "fascists" in a tweet. He said that "there was, I would say, incompetence, bad will, bad faith, on the part of the people who take care of public security in the Federal District". Lula returned to Brasília after the buildings were cleared and visited the Supreme Court and the presidential palace.

After the attack, Justice Alexandre de Moraes of the Supreme Court ordered the removal of all anti-democratic posts by Bolsonaro supporters from Facebook, Twitter and TikTok. After the attack, 1,500 people were arrested, however almost 600 of them were released the next day.

On 10 January, arrest warrants were sent for former public security secretary of Brasília Anderson Torres, and the Federal District Military Police chief, Fabio Augusto Vieira. The Justice Ministry said that the police had found a draft presidential document giving Bolsonaro power to overturn the 2022 elections by using "state of defense" as a reason. On 13 January, Bolsonaro was included as part of the investigation into the riots. Torres was arrested on the next day after returning to Brasília.

The Superior Electoral Court blocked Bolsonaro from seeking office until 2030 for his claims of voter fraud and his role in the 2023 congressional attack.

M3GAN

M 3 GAN (pronounced as Megan) is a 2022 science fiction horror movie directed by Gerald Johnstone. It was written by Akela Cooper from a story by Cooper and James Wan (who also produced with Jason Blum). The movie stars Allison Williams and Violet McGraw, while Amie Donald physically portrays M3GAN with Jenna Davis voicing the character.

"M3GAN" had its worldwide premiere at Los Angeles on December 7, 2022 with Universal Pictures releasing it in theatres in the USA on January 6, 2023. A sequel, named "M3GAN 2.0", is set to be released on January 17, 2025.

A young girl named Cady and her parents are involved in a car accident in the snow, leaving Cady an orphan. Cady is sent to live with her aunt Gemma, a roboticist at the high-tech Seattle toy company Funki. Gemma is developing M3GAN (Model 3 Generative Android); a life-sized humanoid robot doll powered by artificial intelligence, designed to assist in caretaking duties and being a loyal companion to the child to whom it is assigned. After a faulty test occurs with M3GAN’s functions in their lab, Gemma’s boss David orders her to drop the project.

Gemma and Cady struggle to adapt to their new living situation, as Gemma is a workaholic by nature and does not have time to bond with Cady. When Cady discovers Bruce, a motion capture robot that Gemma created, she expresses a wish for a similarly complex toy, which propels Gemma to complete the M3GAN project. The finished model is formally paired with Cady, and David becomes convinced of the project's potential for success after observing the pair. M3GAN exceeds expectations as a friend and largely takes over for parenthood duties and emotional support, to the point that Gemma's colleagues, and Cady's therapist Lydia, in particular, become concerned about Cady creating an extremely strong emotional attachment to M3GAN. In addition, being designed to self-improve and adapt, M3GAN starts operating more independently and targets anything that she deems a threat to Cady. She kills Gemma's neighbor Celia's dog Loue after it bites Cady. Later, she tears off the ear of Cady's bully Brandon and chases him before he trips and falls in the path of an oncoming car, which fatally runs him over.

After Celia aggressively confronts Gemma, Cady, and M3GAN, blaming them for her missing dog, in the evening hours, M3GAN enters the shed in her backyard and after imitating the dog Loue's voice (which leads Celia to the shed) murders her by shooting her hand with a nail gun and spraying her with garden chemicals. Gemma becomes suspicious of M3GAN and attempts to check her video logs to see if she was involved in the deaths. When she finds the files corrupted or erased, Gemma turns M3GAN off and takes her to her colleagues Tess and Cole to fix her. Cady responds violently, lashing out due to her attachment to M3GAN. Gemma tries to apologize for her absence as a parent and tells Cady that M3GAN is a distraction from coping with the difficult loss of her parents, not a solution.

While M3GAN wins over Funki's investors and convinces them to release a worldwide campaign in advance of her release, Gemma, Tess and Cole decide to try to terminate M3GAN due to her volatile and violent tendencies. Tess and Cole attempt to shut down M3GAN while Gemma takes Cady home, but M3GAN attacks Cole by hanging him with a chain. While Tess frees Cole, M3GAN causes an explosion in their lab and then shuts off the alarm. On her way out of the building, M3GAN kills David and his assistant Kurt with the blade of a guillotine paper cutter in an elevator, staging it as a murder–suicide. She then steals a car and drives back to Gemma's house.

M3GAN confronts Gemma, adamant about taking over as Cady's sole parental figure. Gemma attempts to shut M3GAN down again, but M3GAN overpowers her and threatens to lobotomize her so she will be unable to care for Cady. Watching the fight unfold, a horrified Cady uses Bruce to tear M3GAN apart. However, M3GAN's top half remains active, and she attempts to kill Cady for the betrayal. Gemma exposes a processing chip in M3GAN's head, which Cady stabs with a screwdriver, rendering M3GAN's body lifeless.

With M3GAN seemingly destroyed, Gemma and Cady go outside as the police arrive with Tess and Cole. As they leave the house, a camera turns on by itself and looks towards them.

M3GAN has earned over $30 million in the US and $15 million in other countries, the total is $45 million in total all over the world in the box office. M3GAN in certain countries would gross up to $1 million such as Canada.

During the movie trailers and in the movie, M3GAN is known for making up her own dance routine before killing Gemma's boss and his assistant. The dance has gotten M3GAN a lot of praise on TikTok and other social medias as users try to do the dance that she does.

The director Gerald Johnstone officially stated plans for a sequel since the movie has done very well in the box office. Universal also stated that they would be planning to do the sequel as well.

Wilson was born to John Wilson and Annie Clerk Harper in the parish of Glencorse, Midlothian. After his father's death in 1873, his family moved to Manchester. He studied biology at Owen's College to become a doctor. He then joined Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge to study Physics and Chemistry.

Wilson later became interested in meteorology, and in 1893 he began to study clouds and their properties. He worked at the observatory on Ben Nevis mountain to observe cloud formation. He then tried to replicate this effect at smaller scale in his laboratory in Cambridge, by causing moist air to expand in a sealed container. He then experimented with creating cloud trails in containers by ions and radiation. He was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of the cloud chamber.

Official script

An official script is a writing system a country's government uses to write government documents, such as laws, contracts, etc. An official script should not be confused with an official language, because writing systems and spoken languages are not the same. For many languages, the same language can often be written in different writing systems. For example, the Malay language can be written in either the Latin alphabet (rumi) or the Arabic alphabet (jawi).

Also, many languages have changed writing systems for political or religious reasons. For example, English was first written in Anglo-Saxon runes, but English later borrowed the Latin alphabet because Christian missionaries wrote Christian poems and books in English using the Latin alphabet so that the Anglo-Saxons could understand what the missionaries taught them. Also, in 1928, the Turkish leader Ataturk passed a law that said that Turkish must no longer be written with the Arabic alphabet, but now the language must be written in the Latin alphabet. Today, all signs and government documents are written in the Latin alphabet.

Bickley is a very popular residential area, known for its large and expensive houses. It lies between Bromley to the west, Chislehurst to the north-east and Petts Wood to the south-east. It is unusual that for a well-known place with its own railway station, its only shops are a handy local parade at the junction of The Fairway and Southborough Lane. Bickley station earned the dubious honour of being proclaimed the most vandalised station in England; incidents skyrocketed from three in 2001 to 87 in 2006, a rise of 2800%, according to the Daily Mail.


Its railway station is Bickley railway station.

Chislehurst

Chislehurst () is a suburban settlement in south-east London, England and part of the London Borough of Bromley. 
The name "Chislehurst" is derived from the Saxon words "cisel" meaning gravel and "hyrst" meaning wooded hill. 
Camden Place (now Chislehurst Golf Club) is where the French Emperor Napoleon III died in exile in 1873. His body and that of the Prince Imperial were originally buried in St Mary's Church, before being moved to Farnborough Abbey. There is a monument to Napoléon Eugène in the woods, and the area's connections to the imperial family are found in many road names and in the local telephone code, 467, which in its earlier format corresponded to the letters IMP ("imperial"). 

A local attraction is Chislehurst Caves. The caves are considered to be of very ancient origin. Originally they were used to extract flint and chalk. During World War II, thousands of people used them every night as a bomb shelter. There is even a chapel. A girl was born in the caves during World War II, and her name was "Cavina". The caves have also been used as a stage for live music; Jimi Hendrix, The Who and The Rolling Stones have played there. The caves are said to be haunted, and Druids are said to have made grisly human sacrifices in their depths. Several TV programmes and movies have been filmed there, including episodes of "Doctor Who". Tours are available most days, and on Sundays there is an particularly long tour, lasting about an hour and a half. 

The civil parish of Chislehurst formed an urban district of Kent from 1894 to 1934. In 1934 it became part of the Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District, which was divided in 1965 between the London boroughs of Bromley and Bexley.

V Festival

The V Festival is an annual music festival in England, the first to be held simultaneously at two sites, currently Hylands Park in Chelmsford and Weston Park in South Staffordshire, organized by SJM Concerts. Tt had previously been held at Temple Newsam in Leeds, before being succeeded by Carling's Leeds Festival. Originally, the festival took the name of the current year, and the first festival was called "V96". Since 2003 it has been known simply as the V Festival. 
The idea for V came in 1995 when Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker announced that he would love to play two outdoor venues in two days. Pulp's promoters got together and came up with the idea of putting the concert into Victoria Park in Warrington and Hylands Park in Chelmsford so that fans in both north and south would have a chance to see the band. Then came the idea of adding more bands to the bill, setting up a second stage, and letting people camp for the weekend. In the end, Victoria Park was too small for two stages and camping. So in August 1996 there was an artists' day at Victoria Park and two days at Hylands Park with camping. The northern leg of V97 was switched to Leeds Temple Newsham to camping space and three stages. In 1999 the northern leg of the festival moved to Weston Park in Staffordshire and has remained there ever since.

The "V" stands for Virgin Group and began as another means of promoting Richard Branson's companies. The event is sponsored by Virgin Mobile, with Virgin Radio being the official radio station. 

The festival usually takes place during the penultimate weekend of August. Its weekend format, low queue times and professional organization have earned it a loyal audience. The festival sold out in record time in 2006.

Although rock music predominates, the festival books a wide range of music and is probably the most likely among UK festivals to book a few pop acts each year. Melanie C, Dido, and N.E.R.D. have all performed at the festival, with both Razorlight and Faithless performing in 2006. V features a mix of British and international musicians, from up-and-coming bands such as Coldplay in 2000 and Kaiser Chiefs in 2003 and 2008, and glam rockers El Presidente in 2005, to veteran singer Tony Christie. Girls Aloud also performed at the 2006 show and received rave reviews for their performance. McFly performed at the festival in 2007 and received unexpectedly great attendance and rave reviews.

Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz

Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz (Francisco de Asís María Fernando de Borbón; 13 May 1822 – 17 April 1902) was King consort of Spain. He was the husband of Queen Isabella II of Spain from their marriage on 10 October 1846 until Isabella was overthrown on 30 September 1868. Sometimes, his name occurs in its anglicised form as Francis of Assisi. He kept the style and title of king even after her abdication in favour of their son, Alfonso XII. His son was a king regnant, while Francisco himself was a king-father during the reign of the son.

Francis was born at Aranjuez, Spain, the second son (first to survive infancy) of Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain, and of his wife (and niece), Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies. He was named after Saint Francis of Assisi.

Francis married Isabella, his double first cousin, on 10 October 1846. There is evidence that Isabella would rather have married his younger brother, Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, and complained bitterly about her husband's effeminate habits after their first night together.

Twelve children were born during the marriage. Only five reached adulthood:

Starting in 1864, Francisco de Asís acted as president of the Spanish Privy Council ("Consejo del Reino"). 

In 1868 he went into exile with his wife in France and adopted the incognito title of "Count of Moratalla". On 25 June 1870, Isabella abdicated in favour of their son, Alfonso XII—whom the 1874 restoration placed on the throne. By then, Francisco de Asís and Isabella had amicably separated and, with time, became good friends.

In 1881 Francisco de Asís moved into the château of Épinay-sur-Seine. Today, this chateau serves as the town hall. He died there in 1902. His wife Isabella and two of his daughters, Isabel and Eulalia, were present at his deathbed.

Reconnaissance by fire

Reconnaissance by fire (also called recon by fire) is a way for soldiers to find out where the enemy is by shooting at them and seeing where they shoot back from. When the enemy shoots back, it tells the soldiers where they are located, how many they are, and what kind of weapons they have. Once they have this information, they can make a plan to attack the enemy or to stay safe.

During World War II, the Allies used recon by fire to find the location of the enemy by shooting and seeing where they shot back from. This tactic was used instead of the older method where tanks would follow behind soldiers on the ground, which was slow and didn't put enough pressure on the enemy. The new way was fast, and soldiers would shoot their weapons constantly as they moved forward to keep the enemy distracted and aim off target. They also used this tactic when they were travelling with trucks that had big machine guns.

During a battle in Vietnam, a group of American soldiers had a lot of bullets. Their leader, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, told them to shoot at anything that looked suspicious at the same time. This made a lot of noise and made the enemy think they were found out. The enemy then came out and charged at the Americans, and the Americans destroyed them.

Modern rock

Modern rock is an umbrella word used to describe rock music, which is found on college rock radio stations. Some radio stations use this word to check the difference of themselves from classic rock, which is based in 1960s–1980s rock music.

Modern rock is also known as alternate radio. It is a rock format commonly discovered on commercial radio; the format has mostly of the different rock genre.

Generally, it begins with Hardcore punk but later it refers especially to alternative rock music since the 1980s. The term ""modern rock"" is used in the US to show the difference between the music from classic rock. It focuses on music recorded in the 1960s through to the early 1990s.

Mainstream rock

Mainstream rock is a . It is used by many commercial radio stations in the United States and Canada. It is also known as heritage rock. Mainstream rock stations represent the middle ground between classic rock and active rock on the programming band. They perform a balanced airplay of tracks found on active rock and classic rock playlists. But the music playlist has a tendency to focus on mapping hard rock music from the 1970s through the 2000s.

Carrier battle group

A carrier battle group (CVBG) is a naval fleet that includes an aircraft carrier and a group of other ships that work together to help the carrier complete its mission. The "CV" in "CVBG" is the United States Navy classification code for an aircraft carrier.

The first naval fleets built around carriers were seen at the beginning of World War II. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was the first to put many carriers into one task force. This task force was used in the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the Battle of Midway. The United States Navy deployed its carriers in separate formations. Each carrier was put with its own cruiser and destroyer escorts. These single-carrier fleets would often work together for certain assignments. The most notable examples of this are the Battle of the Coral Sea and Midway. By 1943, there was a large number of fleet and smaller carriers became available. This led to them using larger formations of three or four carriers. These groups became the Fast Carrier Task Force. They are the primary battle unit of the U.S. Third and Fifth Fleets.

With the construction of the large "supercarriers" of the Cold War era, the use of each carrier in a single formation was brought back. During this time, the main role of the CVBG in battle with the Soviet Union would have been to protect Atlantic supply routes between the United States and its NATO allies in Europe. The Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own. Aircraft carriers fighting each other would have been unlikely. A main mission of the Soviet Navy's attack submarines was to track every allied battle group. If war started, their mission was to sink the carriers. Knowing this, the CVBG put much of its resources in its own anti-submarine warfare mission.

Ronald de Jong

Ronald de Jong (1962 — 12 January 2023) known as Rooie Ron (translated “Red Ron”) was a Dutch soft drugs trafficker.

De Jong was born in Amsterdam and grew up there. In the early 1990s, De Jong earned a lot of money trading large quantities of weed. As a driver he transported the weed and also smuggled it to the United Kingdom. The police and Public Prosecution Service saw these and other drug transports, but let it go in order to get to the top of the criminal organization with leaders like Mink K. and Stanley Hillis. This became known as the IRT Affair. It caused commotion in 1993 because police officers also turned out to be dealing in drugs and earning millions themselves. There came a parliamentary investigative into these controversial investigative methods, led by politician Maarten van Traa. He had a verdict in 1996 that also led to a stricter legislation.

De Jong later had legal proceedings about money laundering of the money he had earned from the drug trade. In 2017, the court convicted De Jong of money laundering, after a lengthy procedure. He was sentenced to six months in prison and his villa was confiscated. In 2018, the Court of Appeal acquitted him of money laundering. However the Public Prosecution Service appealed in cassation and the Supreme Court sent the case back to the Court for a new appeal.

De Jong died in Spain on 12 January 2023 from a long illness, at the age of 60.

Sweeper (association football)

The sweeper, also known as the libero, is a crucial position in association football. Unlike other defenders who have a specific opponent to mark, the sweeper is a more versatile centre-back who has the freedom to move around the defensive line and sweep up loose balls if an opponent manages to breach the defense.
The sweeper's role is to act as the last line of defense and provide cover for the other defenders. They are responsible for quickly identifying and reacting to any threats posed by the opposition and making crucial tackles or interceptions. The sweeper's ability to read the game and anticipate the opposition's moves is vital to the team's success.
The position of the sweeper is more fluid than that of other defenders, which allows them to play a more proactive role in building attacks from the back. This added flexibility means that the sweeper can also provide additional support to the midfield, making them a valuable asset to any team.
The sweeper position is often associated with the Italian style of play, and the term "libero" is derived from Italian, meaning "free." However, the position has been used by successful teams from all over the world, including the Brazilian national team of the 1970s.
The sweeper is a unique and important position in association football that requires a high level of skill and tactical awareness. A versatile player who can read the game and quickly react to any threats, the sweeper is an asset to any team looking to build a strong defense and launch effective counterattacks.

Surreal humour

Surreal humor (or surreal humour) is a form of humor. It wants to be funny by going against causal reasoning. This causes the humor to be illogical, and the humor is created by irrational or absurd situations, or scenes which do not make any sense. The phenomenon is also called surreal comedy, absurdist humor, or absurdist comedy. 

Surreal humor was made using surrealism, an art movement of the 20th century. French and Belgian artists started it. They depicted illogical scenes while creating methods to allow the unconscious mind to express itself. The movement itself was foreshadowed by English writers in the 19th century, most notably Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. The humor in surreal comedy comes from performing in a manner that contradicts audience expectations, emphasizing the silliness and low chances of the situation occurring, so that the humor is created from uncertainty that is separate from a logical analysis of the situation.

Surreal humor in theater is usually about the insensitivity, paradox, absurdity, and cruelty of the modern world. Absurd and surrealist cinema often deals with elements of dark humor: disturbing or sinister subjects like death, disease, or warfare are treated with amusement and bitterness, creating the appearance of an intention to shock and offend.

The Tagblatt Cup was started in 1900 by the well-known Viennese daily newspaper "Neues Wiener Tagblatt" and was only open to Viennese clubs. The Tagblatt Cup consisted of two league classes. In the top division, the 1st class, five teams played. In the first year they were only four . The rest was divided into the 2nd classes A and B. The winners of these classes played for the Tagblatt Cup the next year. The last two of the 1st class had to be relegated to the 2nd class.This rule has not been applied regularly for various reasons. For example in the last season a relegation was played. The end of the Tagblatt Cup finally came in the fourth season as several teams left the association.

Underwear as outerwear

Wearing underwear as outerwear is a fashion trend. Celebrities, sports and media made it popular. It began as a practical and comfortable variation of clothing, such as the T-shirt and the sleeveless shirt. Later, this lead to fashion statements that were seen as controversial and provocative. 21st century versions include the display of thongs and bras in women's clothing, and the display of underpants under low-slung pants in men. The idea of wearing underwear as outerwear is not new. The display of undergarments was already popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

Whale tail

When women dress up in a G-string, which is partly visible under their trousers, this is called a whale tail. Female celebrities such as Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, made displaying whale tails popular in the early 2000s. Low-rise jeans and thong panties became popular at the same time 

Low-waisted trousers, such as low-rise jeans or hip-huggers, and higher-cut thongs led to greater exposure of the whale tail. The trend was also associated with the trend of sporting lower back tattoos.

In 1999, Noggin mostly made TV shows for tweens and teenagers. In 2002, Noggin changed its schedule. It showed preschool shows in the mornings and teen shows at night. The nighttime schedule got its own name, "The N."

The Noggin channel launched on February 2, 1999 and closed on September 28, 2009. It started out mainly aimed at tweens and teenagers, with a few of its morning programs aimed at younger children. From April 1, 2002 onward, the channel devoted half of its schedule (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) to preschoolers and the other half (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) to its original older audience.

MTV Networks and Sesame Workshop created a company, Noggin LLC, to produce original content for their network in 1999. In 2002, Sesame Workshop sold its stake in Noggin LLC, but it continued to co-produce content for Noggin.

Noggin aired an overnight programming block called The N (standing for Noggin) from April 1, 2002 until December 31, 2007.

Reruns of series from Sesame Workshop's content library were shown as a staple of Noggin from 1999 to 2005. Two syndication packages of "Sesame Street" episodes, titled "Sesame Street Unpaved" and "123 Sesame Street", were created specifically by and for Noggin LLC.

Objectivism (poetry)

Objectivism in poetry is about a group of American poets who came together in the 1930s.

Poets in this group "tend to use language more literally than figuratively, presenting concrete objects for themselves rather than as embodiments [forms] of abstract ideas." 

The name itself, "objectivism," was only meant to be a label for these poets who had almost the same understanding of what poetry can do. Poets such as Louis Zukofsky, William Carlos Williams, and Charles Reznikoff had very different ways of writing their own poems, but Zukofsky said they "felt sympathetic towards each other." In 1931, Zukofsky wrote an introduction and printed poems by many of these poets in Poetry magazine.

Old World blackbirds

The common name "blackbird" is used for at least two different groups of birds. This page deals with the Old World group, which are the genus Turdus, also known as thrushes. "Turdus" is the Latin name for thrush.

The type species is the mistle thrush ("Turdus viscivorus").

The group Passerida is a fairly large group of Old World birds. They include the genus "Turdus" in the family Turdidae.

The blackbird ("Turdus merula", or common blackbird) is a thrush. It is a member of the passerine songbird family Turdidae. There are at least seven species in the Old World, all of which have different common names.

It has a huge range across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand. It has a number of subspecies across its range. Depending on latitude, the common blackbird may be resident, partially migratory or fully migratory.

The adult male is black, with a yellow/orange bill (beak). Juveniles and females are brown, and less easy to see. Blackbirds are easy to find in gardens all over Europe and in Asia, South of the Arctic Circle. On average, blackbirds live to be 2.4 years old, but some have been found to be 20 years old.

It is a terrific singer, and will breed whenever the weather is right.

The male common blackbird defends its breeding territory, chasing away other males or using a "bow and run" threat display. This is a short run, the head first being raised and then bowed with the tail dipped simultaneously. If a fight between male blackbirds does occur, it is usually short and the intruder is soon chased away.

The female blackbird is also aggressive in the spring when it competes with other females for a good nesting territory, and although fights are less frequent, they tend to be more violent.

The male attracts the female with a courtship display: oblique runs and head-bowing movements, an open beak, and a "strangled" low song. The female stays still until she raises her head and tail to allow sex. This species is monogamous, and the established pair usually stay together as long as they both survive. Pair separation rates of up to 20% have been noted following poor breeding. Although socially monogamous, there have been studies showing as much as 17% extra pair paternity.

As long as winter food is available, both the male and female will stay in the territory throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more social, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds is bursts of rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.

Third jersey

A third jersey (or altenative jersey, third kit or alternative uniform) is a jersey or uniform that a sports team can wear instead of its home or away outfits during games. This is often because the colors of two competing teams' other uniforms are too similar to tell the difference easily. In reality, there is never a need for a third jersey in a two-team game. One team can wear its home or normal colours, and the other team can wear its away or substitute colours. Basically, the latter teams' colours cannot clash with the former's. This leaves the possibility that each team's away jersey is so similar, that by accident' the home team may be confused to see the away team in colours that they occasionally play in. But that is a risk for the away team seeing the home team in colours that are not unlike the colours the away team normally wears.

Marion E. Wong

Marion E. Wong (1895-1969) was an American filmmaker of Chinese descent. She is one of a few known female directors of movies. Wong created the first known Asian American-made movie. She wrote, produced, directed and acted in the "Curse of Quon Gwon." Wong also made the scenery and costumes. It was one of the only movies that featured Chinese Americans in a non-stereotypical view. After making "Curse of Quon Gwon", she became bankrupt and stopped filmmaking. Her movie became lost except for 2 tins, which were recently discovered.

Wong was born in San Francisco. She moved to Oakland when she was young. She went to until she moved. Because she was the youngest of a big family, she probably got homeschooled after moving. Her family owned a cafe. As a child, she spent a lot of time at the cafe. When she was 15, she and her brothers went to China to find spouses. At that time, there was an act called the Geary Act. It made it hard for Chinese immigrants to come to the United States. Because of that, Wong and her brothers could only stay in China for one year. If they stayed longer, they could not return to the United States. In China, one of her brothers died of smallpox. The other brother found a good wife named Violet. Violet and Wong became good friends. Meanwhile, Wong found a someone to be her husband. She rejected him and went back to the United States without a husband.

After returning to the United States, Wong started writing the screenplay for her first movie. Charlie Chaplin filmed part of his movie, "One Night Out", near Wong’s family’s cafe. She led her to creating a movie from the screenplay. She hired one of Chaplin's people to be the cameraman for the movie. This cost a whole lot of money. She got support from her uncle who was very wealthy. She started her own movie company. This company was called Mandarin Film Company. Her movies was much better than most movies made by beginner directors.This is partly because of the good person working the camera. She directed and produced her own movie. This movie starred Violet (her sister-in-law), her mother, Violet’s daughter and a professional actor, Harvey Soo Hoo. Her movie was different from other movies of that time. Other movies did not represent Chinese-Americans well. The other movies that had Chinese-Americans in them at that time were all very stereotyped. “I had never seen any Chinese movies,” said Wong, “so I decided to introduce them to the world.” In the first screenings of her movie, people loved it. Because her movie didn’t have stereotypes that were common at that time, distributors wouldn’t buy it. Wong couldn’t pay back her uncle. Her uncle became broke. She was really sad about her failure. She decided to not be a filmmaker. She asked the family to "never speak of her film again”. 

In 1969, Violet told her grandson Gregory Mark about a canister containing the rolls of "The Curse of Quon Gwon". She told him to “do something with it.” In 2004 an Asian-American filmmaker Arthur Dong discovered the film rolls and took the to the Academy Film Archive to restore the film. In December of 2006 the film was recognized as an important historical and cultural film by the National Film Registry. Out of the 8 reels of the film only 2 are saved as of now and you can see them in the Oakland Museum of California.

Modest fashion includes wide legged pants, sheer dresses with non-transparent tops underneath, and traditional abayas.

Hijabs, or head scarves, are scarves or shawls that are usually a part of modest wardrobes. It can be worn to express a person’s identity. French and British colonizers encouraged women in the Middle East  to remove the hijab, so many see it as a sign of protest and pride. Some people think that the hijab should be worn to avoid men’s gaze. The hijab is popular in the United States to prove religious identity, as well. Or, to deepen connections with God. Hijabs mainly represent privacy and morality, as well. In some countries, such as Iran and Aceh Province of Indonesia, wearing the hijab is mandatory. This decision has led to protests, on occasions such as on the death of Mahsa Amini.

She focuses on making beautiful clothing while keeping it appropriate for Muslim women to wear.

He had kicked and beaten the prisoners and made them bend their knees until exhaustion, withheld medical care from them, did not provide them with medicines when they were available, did not give them spiritual assistance and did not isolate them when they had a contagious disease; Jews and Soviet prisoners of war in particular. In September 1941 hundred and one Soviet soldiers entered the camp. During their stay they were not treated or cared for. Many died from an illness, malnutrition or abuse. After six months, the soldiers who were still alive where shot. Nieuwenhusen had the heads of two dead Russians amputated and boiled, and placed the skulls on his desk as 'trophies'.

In March 1942 he left Kamp Amersfoort voluntarily and moved with the "Schutzstaffel" to the Eastern Front.

After World War II Van Nieuwenhuysen was detained in the prison in Leeuwarden.

Socialist Workingmen's Party

Socialist Workingmen's Party (Turkish: Sosyalist Emekçiler Partisi; SEP) is a communist political party based in Turkey. The party was founded in 2016.

The SEP fights for socialism, where social equality is ensured all over the world, and the capitalist system is buried in history with the coming to power of the workers. On this basis, the October Revolution of 1917; He followed in the footsteps of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Trotsky. The founder of revolutionary Marxism in Turkey, in his own words, is the continuation of Mustafa Suphi, who came to Anatolia to establish a "workers and peasants council government on the way of world communism".

He argues that ethno-religious divisions, nationalism, imperialist and capitalist systems in Turkey and the Middle East can only be responded to with the class struggle of the working people and the oppressed. It aims to build a Leninist revolutionary vanguard party to create a socialist Middle East, to organize the workers and oppressed to abolish capitalist private property. 

The SEP claims that the working class can come to power and that the only revolutionary program of the socialist revolution in the 21st century is the program of permanent revolution. 

Considering the internationalist struggle indispensable, the SEP has carried out theoretical productions and practical organizational activities in order to build a new international since the beginning of the tradition. The party was among the founders of the International Socialist Union (ISL), whose founding steps were taken at the 2019 Barcelona Conference. SEP left ISL in September 2022 due to the NATOist tendencies of Argentina-MST, one of the three main sections of ISL, and the Ukrainian nationalist statements and actions of the leader of the Ukrainian section. SEP explains the detailed reasons for leaving ISL in "Letter to ISL Members: Why Did We Leave ISL?" published his article. In this process, party theorists produced theoretical explanations about the imperialist rivalry in the world and the US-China tension. 

SEP, Socialist Middle East continues its internationalist organization activities through its website. As a result, the "İnqilabin səsi" ("Voice of Revolution") was established with Azerbaijani revolutionary Marxists in November 2022. The "İnqilabin səsi" noting that Azerbaijani and Armenian workers are brothers, he stressed that the enemyhood between Azerbaijan and Armenia should be ended immediately.

Ælfric of Eynsham

Ælfric of Eynsham (/ˈælfrɪʧ əv ˈɛnʃəm/; c. 955 – c. 1010) was an English Benedictine monk, priest, and abbot, and a student of Æthelwold of Winchester. He is also known as "Ælfric of Cerne", "Ælfric the Grammarian" ("Alfricus Grammaticus"), and "Ælfric the Homilist".

Ælfric was one of the most important authors of Anglo-Saxon literature. He produced many religious and educational texts in Old English and several texts in Latin. He wrote over 160 homilies (biblical commentaries) and (biographies of saints). Later he translated the Book of Genesis and other parts of the Bible from Latin. He also wrote three books to help young monks learn Latin: the bilingual "Grammar" and "Glossary", and the Latin "Colloquy".

Ælfric’s homilies and lives of saints describe Christian events, beliefs, and history in simple, clear language so that common Englishmen could understand. Compared to the homilies of (Archbishop of York), Ælfric’s texts focus more on the ideas of humility, compassion, and God’s mercy. His works also inform us of the Christian practices and the lives of monks after the English Benedictine Reform.

In the past, some historians confused Ælfric with two other Christian leaders of the time: Ælfric Puttoc (Archbishop of York) and Ælfric of Abingdon (Archbishop of Canterbury).

Little is known about Ælfric’s early life. He was born around the year 955, most likely in the region of Wessex. He was educated from a young age in the monastery of Winchester by Æthelwold, who at the time was Bishop of Winchester. Æthelwold was also one of the leading figures of the English Benedictine Reform, which aimed to replace secular priests in England with monks. This was at the time of the unified Kingdom of England, before it became a part of the North Sea Empire.

In 987, Ælfric was sent from Winchester to the newly established Cerne Abbey – located in Cerne Abbas (sometimes referred to as Cernel) in the county of Dorset. Cerne Abbey was founded by Ælfric’s patron, Æthelmær. He was also the same person who asked the bishop of Winchester to send Ælfric there to serve as a monk and mass-priest. At Cerne Abbey, Ælfric came up with the idea of writing his homilies to make the word of God easier to understand for ordinary people. He also wanted to write in the language spoken by them (Old English). He decided to rewrite many biblical commentaries by some older cleric scholars from Latin to Old English, using less complex language as well. Over time, Æthelmær and his father Æthelweard became Ælfric’s good friends. Ælfric likely left Cerne Abbey in 989 and returned to Winchester. It is not clear if he spent the following years there, but they were the most productive time of his life.

In 1005, Æthelmær founded the monastery of Eynsham near Oxford and chose Ælfric to be its abbot. In Eynsham, Ælfric continued writing and revising his earlier works and he stayed there until his death. The year of his death is not certain, with some sources claiming it happened around 1010 and others saying he died around 1025.

At Cerne Ælfric started working on his two series of homilies, "Sermones catholici". It is uncertain how many entries were of his own creation, but it is agreed that they were mostly a compilation from various Latin sources. Mostly, Ælfric only played the role of the translator, because most of his works were written in Old English. In the Preface to his Homilies, he stresses that most religious texts of the time were written in Latin, which made them inaccessible to common people. He also points out that the existing translations into Old English contain errors: “I would turn this book from the Latin language into the English tongue … because I have seen and heard of much error in many English books, which unlearned men, through their simplicity, have esteemed as great wisdom”. His Homilies deal with gospels, doctrine of the church, as well as major events of the Christian year.

Later, he wrote a collection of three works designed to help students learn Latin, in which he translated the Latin grammar into Old English: The "Grammar", the "Glossary," and the conversation practice "Colloquy".

Ælfric’s "Grammar" is the earliest surviving textbook written in English. As noted by Melinda J. Menzer, it was also one of the most popular books in 11- and 12-century England. This is based on the number of surviving copies in fourteen different manuscripts. Quite surprisingly, in the preface to "Grammar" Ælfric explains to his students that the book is intended to teach both Latin and English. This, however, has become a dispute among scholars, who generally agree that the text does not, in fact, teach any English. The idea of studying vernacular (the local language) instead of Latin was unusual for Ælfric’s time.

The "Glossary" was used to study vocabulary. Although the "Grammar" included some Latin and Old English vocabulary, those words were chosen to portray specific grammatical points. The "Glossary", on the other hand, included around 1250 words grouped together into categories, such as parts of the body, occupations, birds etc.

The "Colloquy", meaning ‘conversation’, was written in the form of a dialogue between a teacher and his students who occupied different professions, such as a hunter, a ploughman, or a merchant. It was written for schoolchildren aged seven and above. The characters describe their jobs and lives, thus offering a glimpse into the activities of “the middle and lower classes of Anglo-Saxon society – a picture which is rarely found in Old English literature." It is also a valuable document in terms of language - although it was intended for Latin practice, one manuscript also included continuous Old English translations and glosses. For example:

Interrogo uos cur tam diligenter discitis?

Ic ahsige eoþ forhƿi sƿa geornlice leorni ȝe? 

[I ask you, why are you so keen to learn?]

Ælfric later worked on another series of homilies called "Lives of the Saints", written as a collection of hagiographies. This work was intended for reading rather than preaching, and its purpose was clearly instructional.

Old English (the first six books of the Bible), created in the 11th century, is the earliest example of an English translation of these texts. Ælfric wrote the preface and translated a part of Genesis. It is not clear who Ælfric collaborated with for this translation. Peter Clemoes proposed that the rest of the manuscript was compiled by , while Peter Baker claims that it was done by an anonymous author. The work contained over 400 illustrations of important biblical events. Notable is the use of Old English as opposed to Latin, for this translation, suggesting that intended recipients of this translation were not only the highly educated, but also the common people. This translation includes two accounts of the granting of the Ten Commandments, which, together with the , provided a framework for the early English law.

Ælfric has been often praised for the uniformity of his Old English language and vocabulary. His writings have become the “model for modern analysis of the language”, in which he rejected the complicated style of his contemporary Old English writings. Instead, he created “an elegant and balanced prose, using simpler vocabulary and structures." In the words of Benjamin Thorpe, Ælfric’s works were expressed in “language which may be pronounced a pure specimen of our noble, old, Germanic mother-tongue”.

My Star in the Sky

My Star in the Sky is a documentary created by Michael Mulroy and Eric Oehlerich. It was premiered in the summer of 2019. 

This documentary tells the story of the survival, friendship and love of two child soldiers, Anthony and Florence Opoka, who are kidnapped and forced to become soldiers of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The LRA is a rebel group that opposes the government of Uganda. Anthony was seriously injured many times. The sixth time he was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. He was thrown into a mass grave and was almost buried until someone noticed his eyes moving. He recovered with minimal medical treatment and became a celestial navigator, a skill he had learned from his father.

Anthony later became a radio operator and code-talker and was eventually made Joseph Kony's radio operator. Florence also served as a soldier. After marrying Anthony in the bush, she delivered her second child during a firefight. After the birth, she "stood up and tied the baby to her back, picked up her first child with one hand and her assault rifle with the other." Anthony and Florence eventually escaped, continued their family, and supported children orphaned by LRA soldiers to this day.

The documentary first premiered in the summer of 2019. It has been screened in support of charities that focus on ending the use of children in armed conflict at , the , a Washington, D.C.-based think tank for international affairs, the , a non-profit group to end crimes against humanity, Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, and the , a national security and leadership development organization based in Washington, D.C.

"" reports that the documentary came about after Mulroy and Oehlerich met the Opoka's during (OOC). Mulroy called OOC a “model” for addressing child soldiers using influence operations instead of lethal force. They worked with Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) who found mothers of child soldiers and had them broadcast messages over the radio, begging them to come home. Mulroy said that many of these kids didn't think they would be allowed back, so to have their mother get on the radio and specifically tell them ‘we want you back’ made a big difference. He continued that other missions are driven by kinetics—this was not.

Marine Corps Special Operations Command Colonel Darren Duke, who previously commanded OOC, said they did everything they could to get the child soldiers to defect so they would not have to fight them by using psychological operations to "appeal to them to lay down their arms," he said during the screening. Mulroy said that he hopes that OOC serves as a model for future programs to address child soldiers, as well as other operations, as it showed how the U.S. military could use "soft power, influence operations" and other aspects of so-called "irregular warfare" to fight the problem.

Michael Mulroy describes Anthony's personal story as a "success" and "extremely inspiring". Mulroy says that Anthony was 14 years old when he did various military affairs in the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), but then he was able to escape and integrate back into society, having also received the help he needed.

Eric Oehlerich comments that through Anthony, we experience the realities of what happens to these children and how they were exploited. Oehlerich says that they know the situation these children are in and believes that they can have a strong impact on the exploited youth.

Quotient space (linear algebra)

Quotient space is a term from linear algebra. It is a vector space that is made using a vector subspace, and a parallel projection. The elements of quotient spaces are equivalence classes. 

A simple example of a quotient space is the following: take the Cartesian coordinate system and draw a straight line which goes through the origin of that system. All the lines which are parallel to that line are a quotient space. 

In linear algebra, the quotient space of a vector space V by a subspace N, also said V/N, is the set of vectors v and w of V such that v-w is in N. We can also say that v added by any vector of N is in the class of v, also called [v]. The set of v and vectors in V such that v plus all those vectors are in N are written V/N (V/N = {v + N | v ∈ V }).

Also, two vectors of V are equivalent if their substraction are in W.

The quotient space shares this two propierties:


Also, dim(V /W) = dim V − dim W. 

We will construct an explicit basis for V/W. Let (w, . . . , w) be a basis of W, and extend it to a basis (w, . . . , w, v, . . . , v) of V. Note that with this notation, dim W = n and dim V = n + k. We claim that (v + W, . . . , v + W) forms a basis of V /W, in other words, ([v], [v], . . . , [v]).

If so, we will then have dim(V /W) = k = (n + k) − n = dim V − dim W as claimed.

Company limited by guarantee

A Company limited by guarantee is a kind of Limited company. In a limited company, the liability of each of the people owning the company is limited. There are two sorts of companies: those limited by shares, and those limited by guarantee. In a limited company, there are shares, and each shareholder is responsible up to the amount of the share, if the company goes bankrupt. In a company limited by guarantee, each member gives a guarantee, to take liabilities up to a certain amount. Very often, companies that are not profit-oriented use this structure. Two examples of such companies are PGA European Tour, which organises golf tournaments, and Oxfam, which distributes aid.

Companies limited by guarantee exist in the United Kingdom, and many Commonwealth countries.

Ichthys (symbol)

The ichthys or ichthus (/ˈɪkθəs/), from the Greek "ikhthū́s" (ἰχθύς, 1st cent. AD Koine Greek pronunciation: [ikʰˈtʰys], "fish") is a symbol consisting of two intersecting arcs, the ends of the right side extending beyond the meeting point so as to resemble a fish.

Fish are mentioned and given symbolic meaning several times in the Gospels. Several of Jesus' 12 Apostles were fishermen. He commissions them with the words "I will make you fishers of men". (Mark 1: 16-18). Having been resurrected, Jesus was given grilled fish in Luke 24:41-43.

Dory (fish)

"gilded one") is shared (officially and colloquially) by members of several different families of large-eyed, silvery, deep-bodied, laterally compressed, and roughly discoid marine fish.

"Main article: Zeiformes"

Zeiformes are a small order of marine ray-finned fish.

John Dory is a delicious fish with delicate white flesh and a firm, flaky texture. A saltwater fish, it has a mild, slightly sweet flavor, and can be served sautéed, baked, steamed, poached, or even coated in breadcrumbs and fried.

Romanichthyini

Romanichthyini is a tribe of freshwater ray-finned fish which is one of two tribes in the subfamily Luciopercinae, which in turn is classified under the family Percidae.

The two genera are:


Luciopercinae

Luciopercinae is a subfamily of ray-finned fish, classified within the family Percidae. It includes the pike-perches and zingels.

The species within the Luciopercinae have a number of morphological characteristics in common. These are the possession weak spines in the anal fin, the lateral line extends as far as the margin of the caudal fin and there are additional lines over and under the main lateral line. They have a cleithrum which doesn't have serrations on the pectoral girdle and they have a vertebrae count of 41–50.

They have a Holarctic distribution. The pike-perches of the genus "Sander" are found in Eurasia and North America and includes such commercially important species as the zander ("Sander lucioperca") and the walleye ("Sander vitreus"). They are largely freshwater species but some can be found in brackish water.




Palaeoperca

Palaeoperca is an extinct genus of prehistoric bony fish that lived from the early to middle Eocene. It was a member of the family Serranidae, which includes the groupers.


Amphiperca

Amphiperca is an extinct genus of prehistoric ray-finned fish that lived from the early to middle Eocene. 

"Amphiperca" was a perch-like actinopterygian.

Labriformes is an order of marine ray-finned fish which includes the wrasses, cales and parrotfishes, within the clade Percomorpha. Some authors include the Labriformes as the clade Labroidei within the Perciformes while others include more families within the Labriformes, such as the cichlids and damselfishes, but the 5th edition of "Fishes of the World" includes just three listed in the section below and includes 87 genera and about 630 species.

The following three families are classified within the Labriformes:

Boops is a genus of ray-finned fish with the following species:


The salema porgy was once assigned to this genus before, but it is now in the monotypic genus "Sarpa".

Space complexity

Space Complexity is a concept in theoretical computer science, specifically Complexity Theory, which is used to measure and describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of memory they will require to store the information they need. Algorithms, when implemented in computer programs, require two main resources when the program is executed: time and memory. Memory, particularly, may be expensive in large quantities. Therefore it is often desirable to make modifications to an algorithm so as to reduce its space complexity, that is, make it use less memory when run.

As with time complexity, space complexity is usually given in terms of the input size, using Big-O notation. Usually, the input size is given as a number formula_1 that refers to an amount of elements that need to be considered to solve a problem. The space complexity is then often given as a function that gets larger as formula_1 increases. This function indicates how quickly the memory requirement grows when formula_1 is very large. 

Auxiliary Space Complexity refers to the amount of storage space that the algorithm will use besides the storage space which is already used for the input data. As the input data for any algorithm will have to be stored in memory, it is often more important to know whether the algorithm can operate "in place", i.e. without a need for memory that will grow as formula_1 gets large. 

The other resource that algorithms consume is time. The so-called time complexity of an algorithm is measured in the same way and is more commonly taught first in courses covering algorithms. It is worth noting that there is a relationship between the auxiliary space complexity of an algorithm and its time complexity: since the former measures the amount of data that is created after the algorithm begins, the time complexity is always greater than the auxiliary space complexity.

Sony Pictures Kids Zone

Sony Pictures Kids Zone is the children's and family entertainment label it was owned by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and Sony Pictures

Sony Music Video launched its "Sony Kids' Music" and "Sony Kids' Video" labels in February 1992 after months of planning under the banner SMV Children's Library. Artists signed to Sony Kids' Music at launch included Dan Crow, Tom Chapin, Tom Paxton, Kevin Roth, Rory, and Lois Young, who would all release product in the spring. After Sony Music Video dissolved in October, Sony Kids' Music and Video were coordinated and marketed through Epic Records beginning in January 1993. On May 22, 1993, Nickelodeon signed a long-term agreement with Epic Records as well.

On July 3, Sony Kids' Music and Video were merged as "Sony Wonder"; Sony Wonder's president Ted Green sought new strategic alliances like their one with Nickelodeon. On April 24, 1995, Children's Television Workshop entered a long-term agreement to distribute "Sesame Street" videos, music, and books through Sony Wonder, while Columbia Pictures began development on two Muppet films which would be released on video by Columbia TriStar Home Video. Sony Wonder also took over distribution of Random House Home Video titles, also during April. 

On July 29, Nickelodeon and Sony Wonder launched a Nick Jr. Channel Video with three titles based on "Eureeka's Castle", "Gullah Gullah Island", and "Allegra's Window"; an audio line launched on March 26, 1996. In 1996, two years after Viacom's acquisition of Paramount Communications, the owners of Paramount Pictures, Sony Wonder's deal with Nickelodeon expired, leaving Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. videos and DVDs to be distributed by Paramount Home Video (and CIC Video internationally until 1999).

On August 2, 1997, Sony Wonder entered a long-term worldwide joint venture with Together Again Video Productions to create and distribute new and previous "Kidsongs" titles, starting with 20 new episodes of "The Kidsongs Television Show". On December 27, Sony Wonder and Golden Books Family Entertainment joined forces to release hit titles from Golden Books' catalog starting in spring 1998; the contract continued with Classic Media after they acquired Golden Books.

The company was also the distributor (in Canada only) for series produced by Cinar, such as "Wimzie's House", "Madeline", "A Bunch of Munsch", "The Busy World of Richard Scarry" and "Caillou".

On May 4, 1998, Sony Wonder bought Sunbow Entertainment, which had produced various shows based on Hasbro's toy lines but whose original programming had mostly under-performed. On March 1, 2000, Sony Wonder signed a first-look distribution agreement with German-based management firm TV-Loonland AG to handle the distribution of their shows in German-speaking and Eastern European territories. and eventually signed a UK home video deal with Maverick. On October 3, as an extention to the previous agreement, TV-Loonland purchased the television division of Sony Wonder, including its programming and ownership in Sunbow. As part of the deal, Sony kept the North American home video and international audio rights to its library. On May 14, 2008, Hasbro acquired the Sunbow programs based on its properties, which are now part of the eOne library.

In 2009, TV-Loonland filed for bankruptcy. In 2011, Loonland sold its catalogue to m4e AG. In February 2017, Studio 100 acquired a majority stake in m4e AG. Studio 100 currently holds the television rights to most of the Loonland catalogue, including Sunbow and Sony Wonder.

On March 13, 2007, Sony BMG announced that it was shutting down Sony Wonder to focus on its core music business. However, on June 20, 2007, it was announced that Sony Wonder became a division of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment as its kids’- and family-entertainment label. Classic Media's, Sesame Workshop's and Random House's video deals were sold to Genius Products for an undisclosed amount, and later to Vivendi Entertainment. The home media releases to Caillou were moved to Vivendi Entertainment Canada. Since 2012, Caillou DVDs are distributed by Entertainment One and after their purchase of Phase 4 Films in 2014, are released through the KaBoom Entertainment label. Sesame Workshop's properties were moved to Warner Home Video in 2010 following the closure of Genius Products. As of 2018, Sesame Workshop’s properties are currently distributed by Shout! Factory through the Shout! Factory Kids label.

In 2012, DreamWorks Animation acquired Classic Media for $155 million; the company became a unit of DreamWorks Animation and was renamed to DreamWorks Classics.
Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, is the current distributor for Classic Media’s properties after NBCUniversal acquired DreamWorks Animation in 2016.

In 2015, the Sony Wonder label was rebranded as Sony Pictures Family Fun, and was later folded and merged into Sony Pictures Kids Zone in 2020.

The Sony Wonder label was still used for the direct-to-video "The Swan Princess" film series up until the same year.

Tiger I

The Tiger I was a tank made by Nazi Germany. It was first made in 1942 by the Henschel und Sohn company. The tank was used during World War II in the North African Campaign and Operation Barbarossa. The Tiger I used a 8.8 cm KwK 36 gun. It had of armor. 

The Tiger I has been called an outstanding design for its time. It has also been called overengineered. It was built using costly materials. The methods used to make it were labour-intensive. Early version of the Tiger would often have track failures and breakdowns. It also had a limited range because it used a large amount of fuel. The tank was costly to maintain but was mechanically reliable. It was hard to transport. It could not move well in areas with mud, ice and snow. These conditions would often jamming the tracks solid.

The tank was given its nickname "Tiger" by Ferdinand Porsche. The Roman numeral was added after the Tiger II was being made. The original name was "Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausführung H." 

Today, only seven Tiger I tanks still exist. They are in museums and private collections worldwide. , Tiger 131 (captured during the North Africa Campaign) at the UK's Tank Museum is the only Tiger I restored to running order.


Cesare Borgia

Cesare Borgia (1475–1507) was the son of Pope Alexander VI. He benefited from Pope Alexander VI's nepotism (placing family in important roles) and became ruler of Romagna, a historical region of Italy, by murdering those who opposed him. He was banished by Pope Julius II and died during the invasion of Castile. His policies were famously described by Niccolò Machiavelli in "The Prince".

Karl Verner

Karl Adolf Verner (1846-1896) was a Danish linguist and a pioneer linguist in the study of phonetics. He was deeply interested in phonetic systems of the Indo-European languages. One of his linguistic fascinations was accentology.

Verner was born in Denmark and studied at the University of Copenhagen, where he received his Ph.D. in 1867. He was a famous linguist but he never worked for any university as a professor. Some universities asked him to work as professor for them, but he always refused and preferred his job in the library of Halle. In Halle, he met many young linguists from the University in Leipzig. Contacts with other linguists further directed him towards his linguistic future.

Verner’s work and influence on linguistics was so important that people still study him and use his ideas for their own books and articles. His greatest contribution to linguistics is called Verner’s Law. The discovery of this law explained some issues with Grimm’s Law whose rules were not enough to explain all exceptions in the historical development of languages.

Karl Adolf Verner was born in Aarhus on 7 March 1846. He was the son of Friedrich Wilhelm Werner, a German immigrant whose occupation was a sock-weaver, and Catharina Dorothea Hansen. He had five brothers, and he was the second oldest of them.

Verner obtained his secondary education at the Aarhus Cathedral School which he attended from 1857 to 1864. It was here that his interest in the field of linguistics started to emerge, and it was in the city of Aarhus where he would later in his life come up with the discovery that would make him known worldwide.

Verner’s interest in linguistics began to form, quite paradoxically, not through the typical scenario of meeting an advanced linguist who would become his mentor. His interest in linguistics would form during his school years in the lessons of geography that he attended. Unlike many other geography teachers, Mr Erslev also taught his students about linguistic and social aspects of life in the countries they covered in the programme. Mr Erslev thus treated his subject contrastively and given the fact that Verner appreciated Erslev’s teaching a lot, it is possible to say that Verner’s contrastive linguistic method was born in his geography lessons.

However, he could not continue chasing his academic dream due to economic instability and lack of capital. Therefore he sought employment as a librarian in order to gain money for his studies. He worked as a university librarian in Halle, Germany. Eventually, his hard work and determination led him to become a docent of Slavic philology at the University of Copenhagen ending with a professor title in 1888.
In 1864 Karl Verner began studying Nordic languages at the University of Copenhagen under the supervision of Konráð Gíslason, Svend Grundtvig, and Ludvig Wimmer. He began mainly as a linguist and later his school activities and interests shifted toward the literary site. Another shift in Verner’s language repertoire came with the influence of his teacher Professor Smith who motivated him to study Slavic languages which became his specialisation, eventually leading to the year 1872 when Verner went to St. Petersburg as a student of Slavic studies. Upon his arrival to Denmark, he composed essays such as “An exception to the first sound shift” and “The final question”, which became the basis for his scientific glory.

However, he could not continue chasing his academic dream due to economic instability and lack of capital. Therefore he sought employment as a librarian in order to gain money for his studies. He worked as a university librarian in Halle, Germany. Eventually, his hard work and determination led him to become a docent of Slavic philology at the University of Copenhagen ending with a professor title in 1888.

While attending the Aarhus Cathedral School, Verner already knew key linguistic texts such as those by Rasmus Rask or the "Compendium der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen" by August Schleicher.

Still during his studies, he was given a scholarship that gave him the opportunity to study Kashubian, which is a dialect of Polish. He could go to the Dantzig area. Being truly devoted to linguistics, he spent a lot of time with the local people, listening to their accent (accentology was one of Verner’s lifelong fascinations) and then noting his observations about it. There is an anecdote linked to his devoted linguistic research. As he spoke to so many people, the local police thought he might be a foreign spy. So he had to go to the police station to testify. Since his passport was only in languages that nobody at the police station understood, Verner had to interpret for himself. When he showed the police a letter from a German professor proving he was a linguist, he was finally free to go.

Verner’s best contribution to linguistics is nowadays known as Verner’s Law. This law explains certain sound changes in the Germanic languages. The Proto-Indo-European voiceless stops became voiced stops or fricatives in Proto-Germanic. In order to even discover the principles of this law, Verner had to study other Indo-European languages. This principle was a major contribution to the understanding of sound change and the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, the hypothetical ancestor of the Indo-European languages. 

Verner also made significant contributions to the field of phonetics, including the development of a system for noting the sounds of spoken languages. He published several books on linguistics, including "Die Lautgesetze der indogermanischen Sprachen" (The Sound Laws of the Indo-European Languages) and "Die phonetische Lautlehre der indogermanischen Sprachen" (The Phonetic Sound Doctrine of the Indo-European Languages).

Heinrich Müller (footballer)

Heinrich "Wudi" Müller (May 13, 1909 – April 5, 2000) was an Austrian football player and coach. In the early 1930s he was an part of Austria's Wunderteam. He played as midfielder mainly for Wiener AC and later for FK Austria Wien.

The trained shoemaker played from 1921 to 1935 for Wiener AC. With this club he won the 1931 Cup of Austria. In 1935 the midfielder moved to MTK Budapest where he won the Hungarian championships of 1936 and 1937. In June 1940 Müller returned to Vienna and joined Austria Wien.

In the early 1930s he played five times for the Austria national football team. He scored four goals. This includes two nominations for the famed Wunderteam.

As a coach, his name is primarily associated with FK Austria Wien. He was three times coach of the team. In total, he coached the club for 12 years.

Most successful was his first period which reached from 1945 to 1954. They became champions in the years 1949, 1950 and 1953 and Austrian Cup winner in 1948 and 1949. In the first three years he also played league matches for the club.

In 1956 he was coach of the Netherlands national football team for one match. In the later 1950s and early 1960s he coached Neherlands first division side Willem II in Tilburg.

In December 1964 after a short time with AEK in Athens, he returned to "Austria" Although they had promising players the club ended up seventh in the league and Ernst Ocwirk was placed as "sporting director" alongside Müller and replaced him fully by the end of the year. In the 1971–72 season he made another comeback on the coaching bench of "Austria", but was without titels again.


Brinkmanship

Brinkmanship (or brinksmanship) is the practice of trying to get a good outcome by pushing events to the brink of active conflict. This succeeds by causing the opponent to back down and make concessions. Ig they do not back down, they risk engaging in a conflict that would not be good for either side. That might be done with diplomacy. It is done by making the others think that one party will do something bad rather than concede. The tactic occurs in international politics, foreign policy, labor relations, modern military strategy, terrorism, and high-stakes litigation. 

The term is mainly associated with US Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, from 1953 to 1956 during the Eisenhower administration. Dulles tried to prevent aggression by the Soviet Union by warning that the cost might be massive retaliation against Soviet targets.

Broomfield, Christchurch

Broomfield is a suburb on the western side of Christchurch. It was named for an estate by Rev. James Wilson (1813-1886), which he named it after a place near Leith in Scotland. Most of the housing built since 2010. State Highway 1 runs through the suburb and State Highway 73 runs through the northwestern side.

Cornufer cryptotis

Cornufer cryptotis is a frog. People have seen it in exactly two places, western Papua New Guinea and Yapin Island in Indonesia. Scientists saw found it no more than 50 m from the Utowa River, 150 meters above sea level.

Phyllodytes praeceptor

Phyllodytes praeceptor is a frog. It lives in the state of Bahia in Brazil not far from the ocean. People have also seen it in Serra da Jiboia, 694 m above sea level.

The adult male frog is 20.7-25.8 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog has large eyes.

This frog is not in danger of dying out. This is because it lives in such a large place. Human beings cut down much of its forest during the past hundred years, but the forest is so big that there is still a large place left. This frog lives in forests where the branches of the trees come together like a roof. This frog lives on bromeliad plants that live on large trees. The female frog lays eggs in the plant and the tadpoles swim in the water in the middle of the plant.

Human beings grow cacao under trees to shade the cacao plants. These frogs can live on these farm trees too. This is another reason why the frogs are not in danger.

Scientists think that the frogs might be in danger if people take away their bromeliad plants, but they do not think anyone is doing this as of 2021.

Sophomore

Sophomore is a term used in the United States to describe a student in the second year of study (generally referring to high school or university study). The word is also sometimes used in the USA as jargon for the second album released by a musician or group, the second movie of a director, or the second season of a professional athlete.

The word comes from Greek, "sophisma" ‘clever device’ from "sophizesthai" ‘to devise, become wise’, and the original English spelling was "Sophumer". It was not until 1726 that the spelling was established in America as "sophomore." 

In the United States, the 10th grade is usually the second year of a student's high school period and is referred to as sophomore year. High school sophomores are expected to begin preparing for the college application process, including reducing and focusing their extracurricular activities. Most students reach the age of 16 while they are sophomores. The year is considered a watermark for independence, closely connected with getting a driver's license in most states. The PSAT, a college preparatory exam taken across the U.S., is now most commonly taken during a student's sophomore year. Students at this level are also considered to be developing greater ability for abstract thinking.

In the U.S., colleges generally require students to declare an academic major by the end of their sophomore year. College sophomores are advised to begin thinking about career options and to get involved in volunteering or social organizations on or near campus.

2023 New Zealand general election

The 2023 New Zealand general election was held on 14 October 2023 to determine the 54th Parliament of New Zealand. Voters elected 120 members to the New Zealand House of Representatives under the mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system, a proportional representation system in which 72 members were elected from single-member electorates and 48 members from closed party lists.

The incumbent centre-left Labour majority government, led by Chris Hipkins, tried to win a third term in government. However, they were defeated by the centre-right National Party, led by Opposition Leader Christopher Luxon, in a landslide. National will need support from the ACT party (and possibly also New Zealand First) to form government.

At the 2020 election, the centre-left Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, won an outright majority in the House. The main opponents to the Labour government is the centre-right National Party, led by Christopher Luxon, and the right-wing ACT party, led by David Seymour.

On 19 January 2023, Ardern announced she would resign as Labour leader and prime minister before 7 February.


Avenue of Mathematics (Seville)

The Avenida de las Matemáticas is a public avenue located in Seville, Spain.

In December 2019, a group of young people from the "Montaigne College" in Seville promoted, together with their mathematics teacher, José Carlos Gámez, a campaign on Change.org to collect signatures and create a mathematics avenue in Seville. They created a website (callematematicassevilla.wordpress.com). In 2020, they had the support of the Seville Institute of Mathematics and the University of Seville.

On March 14, 2022, International Mathematics Day, the mayor of Seville, Antonio Muñoz, received the promoters of the campaign and approved the proposal. That same year it was presented at the "XX Jornadas para el Aprendizaje y Enseñanza de las Matemáticas".

On January 10, 2023, the Avenue was presented with the mayor of Seville, the education minister of the Junta de Andalucía, and various members of the Seville mathematical community.

Just after the Mathematics Avenue was inaugurated, Carlos Navarro Antolín, opinion journalist from the Diario de Sevilla, suggested that now a Latin and Greek street will be released, criticizing that the mayor is more concerned with mathematics.

Some people also complained that the opening ceremony of the Avenue was too exclusive, or that the street chosen was not the most suitable.

Universal Credit

Universal Credit is part of the United Kingdom Social Security system. It was started in 2013 to replace six benefits for working-age people with a low income: income-related Employment and Support Allowance, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support, Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit and Housing Benefit. Like them it is means tested. 

It is paid to families once a month and is designed to help people to work as much as they can. People under 25 get less. An extra amount is paid for children, but only for 2 unless they were born before 6 April 2017, are adopted or are born as part of a multiple birth. Extra money is paid for disabled people, disabled children and carers.

According to the New Economics Foundation the rates of benefit were not sufficient to meet the minimum income standard calculated by Loughborough University’s Centre for Research in Social Policy in April 2023.

People who are working can claim back up to 85% of their childcare costs. People who are responsible for a child or young person or living with a disability or health condition that affects their ability to work get a ‘work allowance’. Each £1 earned (above the monthly work allowance if there is one) reduces the payment by 55p. Universal Credit is paid monthly. People who are paid 4 weekly will get 2 sets of wages in one assessment period once a year, which will reduce their Universal Credit payment.

There is money for rent and some service charges. This is called the housing element. In every area there is a Local Housing Allowance for people renting private property. Help is limited to this level. It was set at the rent of one of the cheapest 30% of homes in the area in 2012. There are different levels for homes with different numbers of bedrooms. It was increased in September 2019 but since then in many places rents have risen more than the allowance. Two-thirds of lower income privately renting households have to find at least a quarter of their rent. 

People who are able to work must look for work or increase their earnings or their payment may be reduced. Self employed people are generally given a "minimum income floor." This is treated as their income each month that their reported income is less. 

Claims are generally made and managed online. People can go to Jobcentre Plus offices where their claims are managed. Citizens Advice are paid by the government to help people to claim. 
5.7 million people were getting Universal Credit in July 2022. 30% were not required to work. Half the households had children. The average monthly payment was £810.

According to the Harivansa Purana, Vasudeva and Nanda (who took care of Krishna during his early years as a child) were brothers. Nanda was a Kshatriya and a King.

Sage Kashyapa is said to have incarnated as Vasudeva, the father of Krishna due to a curse of the god Brahma. Once, the sage performed a yajna (a Vedic sacrifice) in his hermitage for the welfare of the world. Kashyapa sought the help of the god Varuna for the offerings of milk, ghee etc. Varuna granted the sage a holy cow which will provide the offerings on the condition that the sage returns the same to Varuna after the sacrifice. After completing the sacrifice after several days, Kashyapa was overcome with greed, realizing the miraculous power of the cow, and refused to return the cow arguing that whatever is offered to a Brahmin like Kashyapa should never be sought back, and whoever does that would turn out to be a sinner.
Varuna requested Brahma for intervention. Brahma told the sage to get rid of his greed which is capable of destroying all his virtues, but Kashyapa remained adamant. The enraged Brahma cursed Kashyapa that he would be born on earth again as a cowherd and his two cows Aditi and Surabhi would be his two wives. This was King Vasudeva with his wives Rohiņi and Devaki. Kashyapa repented for his mistake and pleaded Brahma for mercy. Brahma blessed Kashypa that he would still be born as a cowherd in the Gopa (Ahir) clan. and the god Vishnu would be born as his son.

Alha

Alha was a legendary Ahir general of the Chandel king Paramardideva (also known as Parmal), who fought Prithviraj Chauhan in 1182 CE, immortalised in the Alha-Khand ballad. The Alha and Udal of the Ahir/Yadava clan of Mahoba, are said to have defeated Prithviraj Chauhan in 52 battles. The Alha and Udal ballads sing of Ahir bravery in the medieval age. 

Alha and Udal were children of the Dasraj, a successful commander of the army of Chandel king Parmal. They belonged to the Ahir/Yadav community.

According to Bhavishya Purana, a text with several interpolated sections that cannot be reliably dated, Alha's mother, Devaki, was a member of the Ahir caste.

Alha is an oral epic, the story is also found in a number of medieval manuscripts of the Prithviraj Raso and the Bhavishya Purana. There is also a belief that the story was originally written by Jagnik, bard of Mahoba, but no manuscript has yet been found.

H.A. Rose wrote in his book, ""Some Indian Folklore in the Lay of Alha"":

Carer's Allowance

Carers Allowance is a Social Security benefit for people in the United Kingdom who care for disabled people but are not paid to do so. 

It was started as Invalid Care Allowance in 1976, and married women were not eligible then. The European Court in 1986 decided that this was unlawful sexual discrimination and the law was changed. 

To qualify a person must show that they care for a disabled person for at least 35 hours a week. There is no definition of caring. Only one person can claim to care for each disabled person. The disabled person must be getting one of these benefits:


The weekly payment is £69.70 per week from April 2022 to 2023. It is taxable and counts as earned income. This is less than most other benefits. 

People under 16, in full-time education, or or getting a State Pension cannot get it. A person cannot get it if they earn more than £132 per week (after deductions including tax, national insurance and certain expenses) They can claim Universal Credit and will get extra as a carer. There is no earnings limit for carers on Universal Credit.

About 5 million people said in the 2021 census that they were unpaid carers. Only 977,506 claimed Carer's Allowance in 2022, according to Carer's UK. in a 2023 survey 41% had to give up paid work completely. 23% had reduced the hours they worked. 14% were using food banks. More of the people getting Carer’s Allowance said they were struggling to make ends meet than those who weren't.

Disability Living Allowance

Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is a Social Security benefit for disabled people in the United Kingdom. It was started in 1992, joining Mobility Allowance and Attendance Allowance into one benefit for people under 65 with two new lower rates of benefit. Since 2013 it is only for children under sixteen. After that age disabled people have to claim Personal Independence Payment. The Scottish Government started a new benefit for disabled children In November 2021, called Child Disability Payment. In February 2022 there were about 1,349,000 children getting Disability Living Allowance, including those in Scotland.

There are two parts of the benefit - care and mobility.

The care part has three rates. For the lowest rate, £24.45,
the child must need help with their bodily functions for some of the day. Bodily functions includes things like washing and dressing, eating, using the toilet, talking and listening. For the middle rate, £61.85, they must need frequent help all through the day, or watching to avoid danger to themselves or other people. Or they must need a lot of help during the night, or need a person to be awake and watch over them at night. A child who meets both day and night conditions gets the highest rate, £92.40.

The mobility (walking) part has two rates. To get the high rate, £64.50, the child must be unable to walk, or only able to walk for a very limited distance, or at a limited speed or manner. Children who are blind or have no feet qualify. A child who has intelligence and behaviour problems so that they cannot be left alone can get the high mobility rate, if they get the highest rate of care. If they get the high rate it can be used to get a car or wheelchair from Motability. To get the lower mobility rate, £24.45, they have to show that they need to be guided or watched most of the time. 

Rates are for 2022-3.

The help the child needs must be more than a normal child of their age needs.

Point-blank range

Point-blank range is any distance where a certain firearm can hit a target without the need to adjust for bullet drop. When a bullet leaves a firearm, it is pulled downwards by gravity. When shooting at a distant target, the shooter must point the firearm above the target to adjust for this. If the target is close enough to the shooter, the distance the bullet drops will be very small. In this case, the shooter can aim the gun straight at the target. 

The sights of a gun are set so that the barrel has a small upward tilt. When the bullet leaves the gun, it starts by rising and later drops. This means that weapon hits too low for very close targets, too high for mid-range targets, too low for very far targets. It hits point blank at the two distances when it crosses between too low and too high. For a .270 Winchester, as an example, the bullet first crosses the line of sight at about 23m (25 yds) as it is rising and again at about 250m (275 yds). With this gun, point blank range for a deer size target is about 275m (300-310 yards).

Point-blank range is different for each weapon. The flatter the bullet's trajectory or the larger the target, the longer the point-blank range will be.

In popular usage, point-blank range has come to mean very close range but not close enough to be a contact shot.

2026 Florida gubernatorial election

The 2026 Florida gubernatorial election will be held on Tuesday, November 3, 2026, to elect the governor of Florida. Incumbent Governor Ron DeSantis will be term limited through the state's constitution and cannot run for reelection to a third term.

Section 5 of the state's constitution states for a person to serve as governor must:


The governor is indirectly elected by the citizens of Florida through the Popular election to a four-year term, along with the lieutenant governor candidate and the incumbent lieutenant governor of Florida. The gubernatorial candidate or incumbent governor must have at least majority votes in order to win the election.

The state's constitution forbids anyone from being elected governor more than twice.

The "Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization" decision in June 2022, which overturned the 1973 "Roe v. Wade" decision and permitted U.S. states to fully ban abortion for the first time in nearly 50 years, has made abortion a more possible issue. In the 2026 election, the topic of abortion is expected to play a major role in the Republican Party.

Due to mass shootings increasingly surging in the United States, the Democratic Party has advocated for an assault weapons ban. This is most likely a major campaign topic to play out in both parties.
The Covid-19 pandemic left a major effect in Florida, leaving over more than 70,000 deaths and over 5 million confirmed cases. This issue will most likely be the main topic within the Republican Party.

Incumbent Governor Ron DeSantis was elected in 2018 and was reelected in 2022, and cannot seek reelection to a third term due to the state's constitution of term limits. 

Potential candidates haven't stated or expressed interest in running yet but might do so such as, Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nuñez, Attorney General Ashley Moody, Congressman Matt Gaetz, Senator Marco Rubio or Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis

Potential candidates haven't stated or expressed interest in running yet, but the following individuals have been floated as possible candidates:

Mecabricks

Mecabricks is an online tool to build, render and animate Lego in a browser using Three.js. In 2012, Nicolas Jarraud (online alias "scrubs") released the first version of Mecabricks. There have been updates with new features such as a tool to animate or the mosaic tool. Mecabricks is popular for its ability to export models directly to blender for realistic rendering and its large library of models.

Some tools the workshop has are:
<br>The the color of the pieces can be changed using a color palette which corresponds to the official Lego colors.<br>The workshop can export and import these file formats:
The Mecabricks render farm was custom built by Scrubs and allows rendering models in the browser by sending the model to the renderfarm. After rendering is complete, the image is sent to Mecabricks where it can be downloaded. The render farm can be used for free, but users are only allowed 10 free renders a day under 0.7 million pixels. With rendering comes a few objects that can be of help, such as lamps, cameras and the volumetric box. Multiple frames can be rendered for rendering animations and other features such as scratches, fingerprints and dents can make the render(s) look even more realistic.
Animation can be done in nodes, which is a separate area from the workshop view that can be toggled on or off. Different node trees are executed when the animation plays. The node trees themselves contain nodes which can determine a piece's position, material (color) and visibility over a timespan. It is also possible to instance large amounts of pieces.<br>Other settings such as frame rate and animation length can also be determined in nodes.
Ttextures can be added to parts, which can be uploaded to free storage for these prints. These prints are then available and can be exported to blender using the blender addon. Other people can then save this print as their own if the model is public and open to workshop.


State Pension (United Kingdom)

The State Pension is a United Kingdom Social Security benefit, also known as Retirement Pension. To get it people have to pay National Insurance Contributions.

National Insurance

National Insurance was the beginning of the welfare state in the United Kingdom. It was started by the National Insurance Act 1911. The idea of insurance was attractive to Lloyd George because it kept individual responsibility. In Britain there were flat rate contributions and flat rate benefits. In Europe both contributions and benefits were generally relative to the workers normal pay. It has changed a great deal since then. 

in 1912 the workers who paid their National Insurance could visit a General practitioner and get medicine they were prescribed without paying. But this did not include their families. 

--------People are given a National Insurance number, often called a NINo, when they are 16. They must have this to get work. Workers make regular payments calculated as a fraction of their pay. The payments are collected and recorded by HM Revenue and Customs. Until 1973 people had a card for each year with stamps to show they had paid. After that it was joined to the system for collecting income tax. They can then get benefits when they cannot work. 

People over retirement age do not pay.

There are four sort of contributions (payments).

Class 1 contributions are paid by employers and their workers. Nothing is paid by people who earn less than £123 a week. Between £123 and £242 a week workers get a credit but dont pay. Between £242 and £967 a week workers pay 12%. Over £175 a week employers pay 13.8% (including for people over retirement age).

Class 2 contributions are £3 a week paid by self-employed people. 

Class 3 contributions are voluntary, People pay to improve their contribution record, usually to protect their pension.

Class 4 contributions are paid by self-employed people as a portion of their profits.

People who cannot work for some reason may get NI credits, usually when claiming benefits. 

The benefits with a contribution condition:

Gilbert Ryle

Gilbert Ryle (19 August 1900 – 6 October 1976) was a British philosopher. Today, he is mostly known for his critique of Cartesian dualism, which he called "ghost in the machine." He was a f British ordinary language philosophers who shared Ludwig Wittgenstein's approach to philosophical problems.

Some of Ryle's ideas in philosophy of mind have been called behaviourist. In his best-known book, "The Concept of Mind" (1949), he writes that the "general trend of this book will undoubtedly, and harmlessly, be stigmatised as 'behaviourist'." Having studied the philosophers Bernard Bolzano, Franz Brentano, Alexius Meinong, Edmund Husserl, and Martin Heidegger, Ryle suggested that the book instead "could be described as a sustained essay in phenomenology, if you are at home with that label."

Longevity claims

Longevity claims are cases of asserted human longevity that have no evidence or have partial evidence. Those asserting lifespans of 110 years or more are generally referred by as supercentenarians. Many have no available evidence or are backed by partial evidence. Cases where longevity has been fully verified, according to modern standards of longevity research, are reflected in an established list of supercentenarians based on the work of organizations such as the Gerontology Research Group (GRG) or Guinness World Records. This article lists living claims greater than that of the oldest living person whose age has been independently verified, Spanish woman Maria Branyas, aged 115 years, 329 days, and deceased claims greater than that of the oldest person ever whose age has been verified, French woman Jeanne Calment, who died at the age of 122 years and 164 days.

"Guinness World Records" from its inception in 1955, began keeping a list of oldest living people. To be in the list, a supercentenarian needs to have at least 3 verified documents.

The oldest person verified by modern standards, and the only person with evidence to have lived to be at least 120 years of age, is French woman Jeanne Calment (21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997), aged 122 years and 164 days.
The oldest man verified by modern standards, and the only man with undisputed evidence to have lived to be over 115, is Japanese man Jiroemon Kimura (19 April 1897 – 12 June 2013), aged 116 years and 54 days.

The oldest verified living person is Spanish-American born woman Maria Branyas, born 4 March 1907, aged 115 years, 329 days.
Lucy Hannah, previously regarded as having reached age 117, had her verification removed in 2020 following the discovery of additional documents.
In numerous editions from the 1960s through the 1980s, Guinness stated that

No single subject is more obscured by vanity, deceit, falsehood, and deliberate fraud than the extremes of human longevity.

Maggie Barnes (1882/1880/1881-1998) claimed to be 117 at her death on January 19 1998. Inconsistent records claim that she was a year younger, 6 March 1882 is the latest, but possibly a year earlier.
Hanna Barysevich: Barysevich claimed to have been 118. This can be neither verified nor disproven from Belarus records. The claim is demographically possible but incompletely verified.
Pasikhat Dzhukalaeva: In 2004, The Moscow Times reported that Dzhukalayeva, of Chechnya, claimed to have been born in 1881 (age 122). The claim is possible but incompletely verified. Her death has not been reported since that time, so no age above 122 has been verifiably claimed.
Susie Brunson: Her obituaries appear in Star-News newspaper and The New York Times. Her family claimed that she was born 25 December 1870 and lived to age 123, dying in late November 1994.

These are lists of people whose lifespans remain unverified by proximate records, including both modern (since 1955). which an individual's supercentenarian lifespan is not (yet) backed by records sufficient to the standards of modern longevity research are listed as unverified. They may be factually true, even though records do not exist (or have not yet been found), so such lists include these grey-area cases.

These are deceased cl

Longevity myths are traditions about long-lived people (generally supercentenarians), either as individuals or groups of people, and practices that have been believed to confer longevity, but which current scientific evidence does not support, nor the reasons for the claims. While literal interpretations of such myths may appear to indicate extraordinarily long lifespans, many scholars believe such figures may be the result of incorrect translations of number systems through various languages, coupled along with the cultural and symbolic significance of certain numbers.

Outside of mythology, the record for the maximum verified lifespan in the modern world is years for women (Jeanne Calment) and 116 years for men (Jiroemon Kimura). Some scientists estimate that in case of the most ideal conditions people can live up to 127 years.

Development of Windows XP

Development of Windows XP started in 1999 after Windows Neptune and Windows Odyssey were cancelled. The result, "Whistler", became Windows XP. Windows XP was finished on August 24, 2001, and the operating system was released on October 25th. 

In June 2000, Microsoft began the beta testing for Whistler. On July 13, 2000, Microsoft said that Whistler would be released in late 2001. Microsoft also released the first preview for the operating system, 2250. Build 2257 introduced an early version of Windows Firewall and a Start menu with two columns.

Microsoft released Whistler Beta 1, build 2296, on October 31, 2000. In January 2001, Internet Explorer 6 was added in build 2410. Builds 2416 and 2419 added new wallpapers.

On February 5, 2001, the name of Windows XP was announced. The name XP was used because XP is short for experience. In April 2001, Microsoft stated that XP would not support Bluetooth or USB 2.0. USB 2.0 support was later added with Service Pack 1. The last builds focused on fixing bugs, user feedback, and final changes before XP was released.

In June 2001, Microsoft indicated that it would spend at least US$1 billion on marketing Windows XP.

On August 24, 2001, Windows XP build 2600 was released to PC builders, and on October 25th, it became open to the public.

Cassette 50

Cassette 50 (Galaxy 50 - 50 Excitantes Juegos in Spain) is a video game compilation created by Cascade Games Ltd in 1983. Its 50 games were almost always written in BASIC. 

It was advertised a lot in home computer magazines. It came with a free Timex digital calculator watch. 

The instructions say "the games will provide many hours of entertainment for all the family at a fraction of the cost of other computer games".

In an interview, Matthew Lewis said he wrote "Galaxy Defence" in 12 hours at the age of 14. He sent it after seeing a small, anonymous ad in a local newspaper, losing the game's copyright and getting £10. His father, Ernest, drew the graphics.

Only some games are on all platforms (e.g. "Star Trek" and "Maze Eater"). Some games are ports or clones of older or popular games (e.g. "Lunar Lander"). Some games are made by independent developers. Some games with the same name between platforms are a different game. Some games have problems that make them harder to play.

"Exchange" and "The Force" are not in the Acorn Electron version, but are listed on the inlay. The Dragon 32 version was released again with some updated games. The C64 version of "Tunnel Escape" is named ""Escape or Bust"" in-game.


The inlay names "Dice Thrower" ""Do Your Sums"".

The number with the '#' symbol shows where the game is on the tape.

The booklet names 'Star Trek' 'Startrek' and 'Jet Mobile' 'Jetmobile'.

The games are very bad. Cassette 50 inspired the yearly Crap Games Competitions (e.g. the comp.sys.sinclair Crap Games Competition and the C64 Crap Game Compo) and a now-defunct website that reviewed bad games.

Palm Jumeirah

Palm Jumeirah is an artificial island on the coast of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Nakheel is the real estate developer of this artificial island. It is the site of numerous private residences and hotels. From the air, the archipelago resembles a stylized palm tree within a circle. The creation of the island started in 2001 ending around 2006/2007 and was financed mainly from Dubai's income from petroleum. By 2009, 28 hotels were opened on the site. The Atlantis is the largest hotel currently constructed on Palm Jumeirah. There are currently over 18,000 thousand living on the island. It was built entirely from sand and rocks, no concrete or steel was used to build the island. This was done in accordance with the order of the Ruler of Dubai, who came up with the idea and the design.

Dubai built the Island to increase the coastline for tourists. Dubai is known for its sunny weather and beaches, but the existing 72 Km coastline was not enough to accommodate the goal of tripling the number of tourists to 15 million annually. The solution was to construct a massive island shaped like a Palm Tree, which upon completion in 2006, would add 56 Km to the coastline. The island was designed to be a city within itself, featuring shopping centers, restaurants, hotels, and residential properties. 

Allen Tate

Allen Tate (November 19, 1899 – February 9, 1979), named at birth John Orley Allen Tate, was an American poet, essayist, and critic.

Tate was born in 1899 in Winchester, Kentucky. He went to college in 1919 at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. The poet John Crowe Ransom was one of his teachers. With his classmate Robert Penn Warren, he joined a group of writers who started a magazine called "The Fugitive".

From 1928 to 1932, Tate lived in France. There he got to know other American writers, like Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein. He thought about what it meant to be a person from the American South in the modern world. He wrote biographies of American Civil War figures from the South.

He wrote his most famous poem in 1925 and 1926. It was “Ode to the Confederate Dead." In that poem, a person walking past a Confederate cemetery stops and thinks about what he sees.

He taught at Kenyon College, Princeton University, the University of North Carolina, New York University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Minnesota.

He received many honors during his life, including the Bollingen Prize and a National Medal for Literature. He was the Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress (poet laureate) from 1943 to 1944.

Militarization of police

Militarization of police means when police officers use military equipment and tactics. This includes things like armored vehicles, assault rifles, sniper rifles, grenades, and SWAT teams. It is also connected to when police gather information on the public and political activists in the same way as intelligence agencies and when police use more aggressive methods. A criminal justice professor named Peter Kraska defines the militarization of police as when the police start to act more like the military and follow their ways of doing things.

People have noticed that the way police handle protests is becoming more like the military. Since the 1970s, police who control riots have been shooting at protesters with rubber or plastic bullets. They also use tear gas, which was first made by the US army in 1919 to control riots. Using tear gas in wars is not allowed by international agreements that most countries have signed, but using it in a domestic (inside of a country) situation or non-combat situation is allowed by police or the military.

Concerns have been raised about the militarization of police. Both liberal and conservative groups, such as the Cato Institute and American Civil Liberties Union, have criticized this practice. The Fraternal Order of Police argue that it increases officer safety and protect the public, but studies have shown that militarized police units are more likely to have violent encounters with the public, they are more frequently deployed to communities with large African American population, no matter the local crime rate.

Many countries have a gendarmerie, which is a military force with police duties among civilians.


2026 California gubernatorial election

The 2026 California gubernatorial election will be held on Tuesday, November 3, 2026, to elect the governor of California. Incumbent Governor Gavin Newsom will be term limited through the state's constitution and cannot run for reelection to a third term.

Section 5 of the California Constitution states for a person to serve as governor, you must be at least 18 years old, and have been a citizen of the United States and California for at least five years. The state's constitution forbids anyone from being elected governor more than twice.

The "Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization" decision in June 2022, which overturned the 1973 "Roe v. Wade" decision and permitted U.S. states to fully ban abortion for the first time in nearly 50 years, has made abortion a more possible issue. In the 2026 election, the topic of abortion is expected to play a major role in the Republican Party.

Due to mass shootings increasingly surging in the United States, the Democratic Party has advocated for an assault weapons ban. This is most likely a major campaign topic to play out in both parties.








Child benefits in the United Kingdom

Child Benefit ( used to be called "family allowance)" is a Social Security benefit for people in the United Kingdom. It was started in 1946 by Clement Attlee's government. 

There was a tax allowance for children from 1909 to 1979. 

The Family Allowances Act 1945 set a rate of five shillings a week for each child, after the first. It was paid up to the age of 15. The amount increased over time. It was £1.50 for each child after the first in 1975. The age limit was then 18.

In 1975 family allowances stopped. Child Benefit was paid for all children. £1 a week for the first child and £1.50 for the other children. An extra 50p was payable to single parents. In 1998, Tony Blair's government increased the first child rate by more than 20%. It stopped the single parent rate. 

The rate is £21.80 a week for the first child and £14.45 for the others. It is paid until the child is 16. If they are in approved education or training it goes on until their 20th birthday. 

From January 2013, people earning more than £50,000 per year have part of their benefit stopped. People earning over £60,000 do not get any.

People who get means-tested benefits - Tax Credits or Universal Credit get extra money for children. Since 2017 there is a limit of two children per family for children born after 2017. The limit does not apply to adopted children, multiple births, or children born after rape. This leaves families £3,235 a year worse off for each additional child above the limit. It is one of the “biggest drivers” of child poverty. 

A person bringing up someone else’s child because the parents are dead or missing can get an extra payment called Guardian's Allowance. This is £18.55 a week a child on top of Child Benefit.

Disabled children may get Disability Living Allowance.

For the first six weeks they get 90% of their normal pay. Then for 33 weeks they get £156.66 a week or 90% of their normal pay if that is less. 

People may get Universal Credit at the same time. Maternity Allowance is usually paid to working women who do not get Statutory Maternity Pay.

Mange tout

Mange Tout (also called snow pea or sugar pea) is a pea which has an edible pod and is eaten when the pod is young and flat. The name in French explains that you can eat the pod too and it translates to 'eat it all.' It is a garden pea which grows well in a small garden. The season for Mange Tout in the UK is between June and September. Mange Tout have to be eaten quickly before they spoil. Fresh Mange Tout should be moist and broken crisply. The colour should be green and not yellow.

Means test

A means test is a check that people are poor enough to get help. Social security, education and healthcare are often free only to people who can show that they are poor.

Poverty is generally judged in a family or household. The members are expected to support each other. There may be tests both of regular income and of capital. People who are thought to be deserving are more likely to be helped without a means test. 

Means testing can be found in ancient Rome, where 200,000 adult male citizens who passed the test were given cheap grain. 

The English Poor Laws gave relief to people who were destitute. Destitution was not defined in the law. In workhouses the rule was that conditions in workhouses had to be worse than conditions available outside. This was to stop people choosing not to help themselves. The National Assistance Act 1948 gave help to people over 16, not in full time work, "who are without resources to meet their requirements, or whose resources must be supplemented in order to meet their requirements." The National Assistance Board made rules about resources and requirements but they were not public. From 1966 there was Supplementary Benefit. The rules were very detailed and public. From 1966 there was Income Support, which was simpler but still public. All these benefits were stopped if a person did more than a very small amount of work.

The development of National Insurance meant that fewer people had to claim means tested benefits. Means testing can be seen as rewarding people for being poor. More recently various ideas have been suggested to reward people for working, even if they cannot do much work. Basic income is one. 

In the United Kingdom there has been a shift towards more means-tested benefits and away from those based on National Insurance.

Robert Creeley

Robert White Creeley (May 21, 1926 – March 30, 2005) was an American poet and teacher.

Creeley was born in West Acton, Massachusetts. His father was a doctor who died when Creeley was very young. An accident caused him to lose his left eye before he was five years old.

In 1943, he started at Harvard University. He left Harvard to serve in the American Field Service in Burma and India in 1944–1945. His first poem was printed at Harvard in 1946.

In 1954 the poet Charles Olson asked Creeley to come and teach at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Creeley would also edit the "Black Mountain Review". That college brought together many artists, poets, dancers, and musicians. It was a center for much new art from 1933 to 1957.

At Black Mountain and later, Creeley connected with other poets who shared ideas about poetry. These others included Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Robert Duncan, Kenneth Rexroth, and Philip Whalen.

In his first important book, "For Love", Creeley wrote poems that cared about "the sounds and rhythms of language" and how words were put on the page. One critic said, "We recognise Creeley’s poems first by what they leave out: he uses few long or rare words, no regular metres and almost no metaphors.”

Creeley won many awards. He received the Lannan Lifetime Achievement Award, the Bollingen Prize, the Frost Medal, a National Endowment for the Arts grant, and a Rockefeller Foundation grant. He was Professor of Poetry and Humanities at the State University of New York, Buffalo. And he was the New York State poet from 1989 to 1991.

John Irving

John Winslow Irving (born John Wallace Blunt Jr.; March 2, 1942) is an American-Canadian novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter.

Irving was born in Exeter, New Hampshire. His parents divorced before he was born. His name was changed when his mother married again. His step-father was a teacher at Phillips Exeter Academy. When he graduated from there, Irving went to the University of Pittsburgh. After one year there, he went to study in Vienna, Austria. He came back to the United States to study at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. One of his teachers there was Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.. In Iowa, he wrote his first novel, "Setting Free the Bears".

He became well-known in 1978 when "The World According to Garp" came out. It was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction in 1979. In 1999 he won an Academy Award for his screenplay of his novel "The Cider House Rules". In 2018, he won the Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award.


Jobseeker's Allowance

Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) is a Social Security benefit in the United Kingdom for people who are unemployed.

Unemployment Benefit was started in 1911 by the National Insurance Act 1911 for people who had paid National Insurance contributions. This was the first legal insurance scheme against unemployment in the world. At first it was only for people in a few industries like engineering and ship building. From 1920 it covered more workers. From 1947 it covered everyone. In 1996 it was changed to Jobseeker's Allowance.

To make a claim people must show that they are actively seeking work by filling in a Jobseeker's Agreement form and attending a New Jobseeker interview. They must also go to a Jobcentre Plus every two weeks to "sign on", that is, to say that they are still actively seeking work. 

Payment can be stopped (sanctioned) if the person is thought not to be doing their best to find a job. The system of sanctions makes little difference to job finding efforts, but is very damaging especially to disabled people and people bringing up children on their own. 

Payment is £61.05 a week for people under 25 and £77 a week for people over 25. It stops after 182 days. 

When it started there was a means tested Jobseeker's Allowance but it was stopped in 2022. Now people can claim Universal Credit if they do not qualify or if the benefit is not enough for them to live on.

Le Morte d’Arthur

"Le Morte d’Arthur" is a compilation of Arthurian romances put together by Sir Thomas Malory and contains both old English legends and original work written by Malory himself. The 1450s are considered the start of Malory’s writing of the book, with the first edition being published in 1485 by William Caxton. To this day, the compilation is considered the best-known English Arthurian legend.

While the exact identity of the author of "Le Morte d'Arthur" has been questioned, Thomas Malory born in 1416 in Newbold Revel, Warwickshire, England to Sir John Mallory has been most widely accepted by scholars as its author.

Malory had engaged in criminal activities including theft, attempted murder of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, accusations of rape, and robbery. Malory was imprisoned in several prisons and managed to escape multiple times. In 1461, King Henry VI granted him a pardon. However, he was imprisoned again in 1468 because of his allegiance to the House of Lancaster and his plot to overthrow King Edward IV. He was imprisoned at Newgate Prison in London, where he most likely wrote "Le Morte d'Arthur." Henry VI returned to the throne in 1470 and Malory was thus released from prison again. He died only five months later.

The other likely candidate for the authorship of "Le Morte d'Arthur" is Thomas Mallory of Papworth St Agnes in Huntingdonshire. This theory was put forth by T. A. Martin in the Athenaeum magazine in September 1897. 

Until 1934, William Caxton’s printed edition of 1485 was thought to be the earliest surviving version of Malory’s text. However, that year Walter Oakeshott (a librarian at Winchester College) was collecting the college’s most interesting books when he discovered a manuscript. He discovered that the text had been written in years between 1471 and 1483 by two scribes working together.

Clues on its pages proved this was one of the manuscripts used by William Caxton in the preparation of his "Le Morte D'Arthur". Pages fresh from the press had been laid on the manuscript and the wet ink accidentally transferred reversed images of Caxton’s distinctive typefaces. So it is probable that the manuscript was in Caxton’s Westminster workshop during the early 1480s. The printer may even have borrowed the manuscript from one of Malory’s family members.

There is much debate over the way in which these two versions relate to each other. Field observes, however, that certain drastic and deliberate changes are made. Scholars continue to debate whether Caxton or Malory authorized these alterations. Roland argues that the differences between the Caxton and Winchester versions of this narrative suggest that Caxton "overwrote his copy text to comply with his world view, just as Malory had overwritten his source texts before him," and observes that the Roman Wars accounts in both Caxton and Malory's versions are informed by "almost four hundred years of struggles for dominion over the east and a gradual slipping away of the conquests made by the First Crusade". According to Roland, Caxton's version of the Roman War and his possible amendments to the Morte are a direct response to contemporary fears of Turkish expansion. In addition, she discovers that Malory's "Morte" was "written in the arc of an ascending fear of the Turks, an arc that reaches its zenith just as Caxton publishes Malory's work in the mid-1480s, a time when Europe was awash in uncertainty as to the repercussions of Mehmed II's death". For these reasons, the emphasis on crusades and on fears of foreign invasion begin to take on a deeper significance when the context of the Winchester and Caxton versions is considered.

Thomas Malory’s "Le Morte D’Arthur" was first printed by William Caxton, who is generally accepted to be the first printer in England. The printing of the first edition was carried out in 1485 by Caxton’s printing house and has been of great significance, since Caxton’s printed version allowed for further distribution and printing by other printing houses. Further printing of Malory’s text by different English printers is what allowed the creation of the canonical text of Arthurian literature in the English language, as this piece of writing became more widely distributed. During the times of Victorian Britain, Malory’s first printed version, and the whole genre of English Arthuriana, gained great popularity within the academia, as well as the general population. What was especially praised was Malory’s treatment of the topic of violence, which abundantly occurs in the legend. The occurrences of killings and rape were treated with a sense of religious significance and later act as patriotic and sacred, rather than barbaric and immoral, causing the text to become a symbol of morality and Godly ideology. Furthermore, it is not only Malory’s text that was praised. William Caxton and his printed edition were greatly valued by Victorian scholars, too. It was regarded as Caxton’s most influential production. The academia generally agreed that if it was not for Caxton’s agreement to print Malory’s text, English literature might have moved in a very different direction, or been radically altered, even. Although there are several different versions of Malory’s text, each is used for different purposes, as each was published with an altered, mostly modernized, version of the language.

"Le Morte D’Arthur" was written in Middle English, a period of the English language in 11th to 15th century England. Published in 1485, the year of Thomas Malory’s writing corresponds with the end of the Medieval English era. In comparison to Geoffrey Chaucer’s "Canterbury Tales", a significant piece of writing written in typical Middle English style, Malory’s language and use of English are much closer to Early Modern English. Although Chaucer’s writing was published 85 years before Malory’s, their work belongs to the same historical and language period, and as such are often compared, especially language-wise. Although the spelling of Malory’s text does not necessarily correspond with the spelling of Early Modern English, from a grammatical and lexical point of view, it reads similarly to early Elizabethan English. The reason for the modernization of Malory’s writing is believed to be the inspiration in French texts, which gave Thomas Malory the foundation for his story. It is generally agreed that the French language was what so heavily influenced Malory’s own style of writing, as it is with high probability what modernized the language. Concerning the style specifically, Thomas Malory has been both criticized and praised for his rich usage of connecting words such as “so–and–then,” usually used to transition between stories, and for his lengthy and repetitive sentences and phrases, which some scholars condemned as too simplistic, others have, however, praised it to be of high aesthetic quality. 

Malory's first book's storyline is mainly based on the Prose Merlin in the "Post-Vulgate Suite du Merlin".

This book is based mainly on the first half of the Middle English heroic poem "Alliterative Morte Arthure", which is mostly based on  "Geoffrey of Monmouth"’s p"seudo-chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae."

This book is based on parts of the French "Prose Lancelot", mostly its "'Agravain"' section, along with the chapel perilous episode taken from "Perlesvaus".

Unlike most of the material in the preceding books, this specific one is not directly based on any preexisting literature. Instead, it is inspired by several Arthurian romances of the Fair Unknown genre, also known as "Le Bel Inconnu", or "Sir Gingalain" 

That is the longest of his eight books, it is based primarily on the lengthy "Prose Tristan" in French, or the lost English translation of it, and also could be from the Middle English verse romance "Sir Tristram".

For this lengthy book, the main source is "The Vulgate Queste del Saint Graal", which details the exploits of numerous knights in their mythical search for the Holy Grail.

In this book, Malory explicitly mentions the adultery of Guinevere and Lancelot. He combined the story from both the "Vulgate Cycle prose Lancelot" (counting the story of the Fair Maiden of Astolat and an abridged retelling of "Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart") and his own creative setups.

For writing his final book, he used the version of Arthur's death derived primarily from parts of the "Vulgate Mort Artu", and as a secondary source, he used the "English Stanzaic Morte Arthur."

Sivananda is alleged to have been born on August 8, 1896, although this has not been independently verified. Indian media have taken his claimed date of birth at face value but credible sources supporting/contravening the same are lacking. He was born in Sylhet District of Bengal Presidency of British India (present-day Sylhet Division of Bangladesh).

His parents lived in extreme poverty and even had to beg for their living. His sister, mother, and father all died within a month of each other when he was just six years old. Then he travelled to Kashi from Bengal and began serving there. Swami Sivananda mastered yoga and meditation after receiving his education from Guru Omkarananda.

For over three decades, he taught yoga on the banks of river Ganga in Varanasi.

Greatest Generation

The Greatest Generation is an American term for a generation of people. They were born from about 1901 to 1927. They are also called the G.I. Generation and the World War II generation. Members of this generation were born after the Lost Generation and before the Silent Generation. They were affected by the Great Depression. Most of the enlisted military members in World War II were part of the Greatest Generation.

Pew Research Center defines this generation as people who were born from 1901 to 1927. Strauss and Howe use the birth years 1901 to 1924. The first half of the generation, born between 1901 and 1913, are sometimes called the Interbellum Generation.

In the United States, members of this generation were born and became adults during the Progressive Era, World War I, and the Roaring Twenties. This was a time of economic prosperity with distinctive cultural changes. People who lived between 1918 and 1920 also experienced the deadly Spanish Flu pandemic. During their youth, they saw the invention of many new technologies. These included radio, telephone, and automobiles. Income inequality was growing around the world. The economy was also growing quickly. After the stock market crashed in 1929, this generation had deep economic and social problems.

Despite the hard times, literature, arts, music and movies of the time period flourished. This generation had the "Golden Age of Hollywood." It began in the 1930s. Many popular types of movies, including gangster movies, musical movies, comedy movies and monster movies, attracted large audiences. The Great Depression also affected literature. During the Depression, the first modern comic books were published. Comic books were popular with members of this generation with characters such as Doc Savage, The Shadow, Superman and Batman. The Greatest Generation often listened to jazz, blues, gospel and folk music. Swing jazz became very popular with them. This has caused them to be described as the "Swing Generation". The popularity of the radio also had a large effect in their lives. Millions of people listened to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "fireside chats" (or radio programs). They absorbed news in a way like never before.

Over 16 million Americans served in World War II. Most of them were members of this generation. 38.8% were volunteers, and 61.2% were drafted into the military. The average length of their service was 33 months. 671,278 Americans were killed and wounded during the war.

After the war, this generation produced many more children than earlier generations. Over 76 million babies were born between 1946 and 1964. The G.I. Bill helped the many veterans in this generation. The government paid for their education in colleges, universities, and trade schools. It gave them loans for many purposes, and helped them buy houses. Because they were richer, many people in this generation moved their families into the suburbs. They largely promoted more conservative ideas as the country faced the threat of the Cold War and a Second Red Scare. Some were again called to serve in the Korean War together with the Silent Generation. The first member of their generation to be elected president, John F. Kennedy, began a Space Race against the Soviet Union. His successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, promoted a controversial "Great Society" policy. Research professor of sociology Glen Holl Elder, Jr., an important figure in the development of life course theory, wrote "Children of the Great Depression" (1974), "the first longitudinal study of a Great Depression cohort." Elder followed 167 people born in California between 1920 and 1921 and "traced the impact of Depression and wartime experiences from the early years to middle age. Most of these 'children of the Great Depression' fared unusually well in their adult years". They came out of the hard times of the Great Depression "with an ability to know how to survive and make do and solve problems.”

This generation faced chaos in the form of the Vietnam War, civil rights movement, Watergate scandal, and the counterculture of the 1960s. Attitudes shaped during World War II clashed with those of the Vietnam era. Many struggled to understand the general distrust of the government by the younger generations, while some supported anti-war protests.

According to a 2004 study done by AARP, "There are 26 million people aged 77 or older in the United States. These people are largely conservative on economic (59%) and social (49%) issues, and about one-third of
them say they have become more conservative on economic, social, foreign policy, moral, and legal issues as they have aged. Over 9 in 10 (91%) of this age group are registered to vote and 90% voted in the 2000 presidential election. The last member of this generation to be elected president was George H. W. Bush (1989–1993), and as of 2023 the last surviving president from this generation is Jimmy Carter (1977–1981). In its later years, this generation was introduced to continued technological advancements such as mobile phones and the Internet.

As of 2019, approximately 389,000 of the 16 million Americans who served in World War II remain alive. Living members of this generation are either in their 90s or are centenarians (over 100 years old).

The lives of this generation are a common element of popular culture in the Western world. Media related to this generation's experiences continues to be produced. Some people have criticized the romanticizing of this generation. However, some also praise the traits and actions of this generation, and say that their sacrifices should be a lesson for current generations.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, living members of this generation have been impacted by the pandemic, such as Lee Wooten, who was treated in the hospital for coronavirus and recovered just before his 104th birthday in 2020.

In Britain, this generation became adults, like most of the western world, during a period of economic difficulty as a result of the Great Depression. When the war in Europe started, millions of British citizens joined the war effort at home and abroad. 2.9 million members of this generation served in the war, and 384,000 were killed or wounded. At home, The Blitz killed thousands of people and destroyed entire British cities. The men and women of this generation continue to be honored in the U.K., particularly on V-E Day. In 2020, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson compared this generation to current generations, and indicated his desire for current generations to show the “same spirit of national endeavour”, in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Queen Elizabeth II, a member of this generation who lived through World War II, said many of the same things.

Members of the World War II generation in Germany became adults after World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919. They faced economic difficulties related to the Great Depression and Treaty of Versailles, as unemployment rose to nearly 40%. Adolf Hitler then rose to power, and many of this generation joined groups such as the Hitler Youth. In 1935, Hitler started military conscription. During the war, nearly 12.5 million members of this generation served in the war and 4.3 million were killed or wounded. By the end of the war, 5 million Germans were dead, including civilians. German cities and towns were ruined or destroyed by Allied bombing attacks. 12 million Germans were refugees and many were forced to live in the Soviet Union. In addition, the Holocaust killed millions of German Jews and others. After the war, the Allies began the denazification and demilitarization of Germany. Returning German veterans found their country divided into four zones of occupation; later becoming West Germany and East Germany. In the west, the Marshall Plan resulted in the "Wirtschaftswunder", an economic boom that caused 185% growth between 1950 and 1963. Surviving members of the German World War II generation would go on to experience the Fall of the Berlin Wall and the creation of the European Union. Unlike the Western allies and the Soviet Union, Germany did not honor its veterans, as the association with Nazism continues in Germany today.

Members of this generation became adults during Stalin's rise to power. They lived through the Holodomor famine, which killed millions. The World War II generation of the Soviet Union was further decimated by the war. Stalin's scorched earth policy left its western regions to be destroyed by the advancing German army. The USSR lost 14% of its pre-war population during WWII. This decrease in population had huge long-term consequences. Huge numbers of people were used as forced labor. Between 10 and 11 million Soviet men returned to help rebuild, along with 2 million Soviet dissidents held prisoner in Stalin's Gulags. Then came the Cold War and the Space race. Even in the mid-1980s, around 70% of Soviet industrial output was directed towards the military. This was one of the factors in its eventual economic collapse. Members of this generation are known as "Great Patriotic War" veterans. Today, former Soviet countries celebrate an annual Victory Day in honor of these veterans.

The World War II generation of Japan became adults during a time of growing imperialism. One member of this generation, Hirohito, became Emperor in 1926, when Japan was already one of the great powers. Nearly 18 million members of this generation fought in World War II. Approximately 3 million, including civilians, were killed or wounded. Japanese cities, towns, and villages were ruined or destroyed by Allied bombing campaigns. In an effort to prepare for the assumed Allied invasion, the Japanese government planned to use this generation for "Operation Ketsugo", in which the Japanese population would fight a war of attrition. This generation is one of the only generations thus far that have been killed by an atomic bomb; as hundreds of thousands lost their lives when the United States dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Returning veterans found their country occupied and received little support or respect. Surviving members of this generation saw Japan become the world's second-largest economy by 1989. Surviving veterans visit the Yasukuni Shrine to show respect for their fallen comrades.

Even after defeat Japan's economy became more successful than ever before, through businesses, such as Sony Corporation, and cultural influence, as in movies by Akira Kurosawa.

North Manchester General Hospital

North Manchester General Hospital (NMGH) is a large NHS hospital in Crumpsall, North Manchester. 

The buildings are not in good condition. There is a plan to rebuild the hospital. It was one of the 40 new hospitals Boris Johnson promised in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto. In January 2023 the managers complained that building had not started. Delay was putting the cost up. The cost had gone up 30% to £976 million. The ceiling had fallen down so the operating theatres had to be closed for 6 weeks. 

In November 2022 a new garden for patients and staff was opened at the Intensive Care Unit. 

Springfield Hospital was a workhouse. It opened in 1853. It was called the Crumpsall Institution. It was for people who were mentally ill. Later it was called Park House. 

Delaunays Hospital was also built as a workhouse. It opened in 1869. 

Crumpsall Hospital was built for the Manchester Union Workhouse. It opened in 1876. It had 1,440 beds in 1928 with 600 more in the mental department.

NHS trust

NHS trusts were started in 1990 by Margaret Thatcher's government. The idea was to bring a market into the National Health Service in England and Wales. They took the place of District health authorities which had managed the services before. 

Each trust has a board with managers. After 2002 many of them became foundation trusts. They had more freedom. The plan was that they would all become foundation trusts, but that hasnt happened. 

In 2015 there were 470 trusts. They have been joined to make bigger organizations. In April 2020 there were 217 trusts, with about 800,000 employees. There are only 3 trusts in NHS Wales. In Northern Ireland there are 5 health and social care trusts. 

After 2017 there was less talk about markets in the NHS. Integrated care systems were started. 

About 65% of a trust's money goes on paying the workers.

Prescription charge

In the English National Health Service people between age 16 and 60 may have to pay a charge for prescribed medicine. The charge is £9.35 for each one. People can get a certificate which lasts for 3 months for £30.25, or one which lasts a year for £108.10. 

In April 2023 a new charge was started for Hormone Replacement Therapy. The new HRT prepayment certificate costs £19.30 a year. 

People dont have to pay if they are:


People who do not pay when they should can be punished. They may have to pay more than £100.

People with these conditions are given a medical exemption certificate. They dont have to pay for any prescriptions,


In 2008 only 12% of patients in England had to pay. The Prescription Charges Coalition campaigns for free prescriptions for everyone with a long term condition. The conditions which get free prescriptions had long-term life-saving medicine in 1968, and it has not been changed since then. The prescription charges rules were called a "dog's dinner" by the Social Market Foundation. The National Pharmacy Association says the charges mean some people dont take their medicine. They end up in hospital which costs more than the cost of a prescription. Healthwatch England asked 2000 people about costs in December 2022. 10% said the increased cost of living meant they did not get their prescription. 

When the NHS started in 1947 all prescriptions were free. Charges were started in 1952. They stopped in 1965 and were started again in 1968. They were stopped in Wales in 2007, in Northern Ireland in 2010 and in Scotland in 2011.

2023 compulsory mathematics plan

On January 3, 2023, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Rishi Sunak announced that he would propose to make mathematics compulsory in schools until the age of 18.

Mathematics is compulsory on the curriculum for all pupils in England up to age 16, like in Spain.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the teaching of mathematics had suffered the consequences of online education. General Certificate of Secondary Education poor results in mathematics over the past years was also a reason to promote this measure.

Rishi Sunak said in his speech:
In 2021, a University of Oxford study concluded that the lack of mathematics education after the age of 16 negatively affects adolescent brain and cognitive development.

Mathematician and biologist Kit Yates from the University of Bath said in The Guardian an that "Sunak’s plan for compulsory maths doesn’t add up".

Beaver coins

Beaver Coins were gold coins made in Oregon in 1849. They were also known as Beaver Money. Their name comes from the beaver on the front of the coins. The currency contained 8% more gold than other coins from that same period of American history in the United States of America. Today these coins are rare and valuable.

After the creation of the Territory of Oregon, the mint that made the coins became privately owmed. It still made coins until Governor Joseph Lane said they this was unconstitutional in September 1849. Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution says that the mintage of coins is one of the powers of the Congress.) The opening of the United States Mint branch in San Francisco, California made many gold and silver U.S. currency available. This helped end the usage of the "Beaver Coins".

General practitioner

A general practitioner (GP) also called a family doctor or a primary care physician is a medical doctor who works outside of a hospital. They deal with all sorts of health problems. They often get to know families over a long time. This continuity is very important. In many countries they send people to see specialists. Away from towns they may have to deal with emergencies and deliver babies. They spend most of their time looking after illness in young children and old people.

In many countries general practitioners run their own small business. They are very important in rural medicine. 

The number of general practitioners increased from 15,000 in 1913 to 19,000 in 1938. 17.6 million people were registered with a GP in 1938 - about half of the population.

In December 2022 there were 36,622 permanent qualified GPs working in England - Full-time equivalent was 27,375. 69% worked between 15 and 37.5 hours a week. The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom changed the way they worked. Telephone and video was used much more. Some people were very unhappy about this and there were a lot more complaints. In Northumberland, Gosport, Wolverhampton and West Cheshire some of the GPs now work for the local hospital trust.

Numbers of GPs have been dropping for several years. Demographic change has led to “demand outstripping supply” with an increasing – and increasingly elderly – population putting immense pressure on GP services which have not expanded in the last ten years. In 2015, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would recruit 5,000 more GPs by 2020. By 2024 number of fully qualified doctors at GP surgeries in England had fallen by 1,877. and the number of registered patients had increased by 11%.

In November 2022 more than 4,000 GPs in Madrid went on an ‘indefinite strike’. People had to wait a week to see a GP. They were each seeing ‘more than 50 or 60 patients’ in their working day.

It had a budget of £129.9 billion in 2020-21. Most of the money was given to the local clinical commissioning groups but the 154 most specialized services were managed by them. The start of integrated care systems meant that some of this work could be managed in these larger areas. In 2023 it plans to give the money, £13 billion, for 59 services to 9 committees of integrated care systems. The rest of the £23 billion for specialised services will still be managed by NHS England.

Shigechiyo Izumi

Shigechiyo Izumi (? - 21 February 1986) was a Japanese Centenarian who was recognised as the oldest living person in the world after the death of Niwa Kawamoto on 16 November 1976. Izumi's claimed birthdate of 29 June 1865 was accepted by Guinness World Records, which recognised him as the oldest verified man ever, but in the 2012 edition of the Guinness World Records book, he was not mentioned and was replaced with Christian Mortensen.

After a brief hospitalization, he died of pneumonia at 9:15PM (Japanese UTC) on 21 February 1986 at the age 120, although some claim his birth certificate belonged to a deceased brother. And his family might have used "Shigechiyo" as a necronym.

Obituaries were found of a centenarian with the exact same name but born in 1880 instead of 1865.

The oldest undisputed case of male longevity is Jiroemon Kimura, also from Japan, who died on June 12 2013 aged 116 years and 54 days.

Korpiklaani

Korpiklaani (Finnish: ) is a Finnish folk metal band. The band was made in Lahti as the Shamaani Duo in 1993. It was also named Shaman. Jonne Järvelä is the only person who has stayed in the band since it was made. He is the singer and guitar player for the band.

Korpiklaani started as a folk music group named the Shamaani Duo. It was made by Järvelä and singer Maaren Aikio. When Aikio left, Järvelä renamed the group to Shaman. He started making folk metal instead of folk music. They made two albums, then the band's name changed again to Korpiklaani. They joined Napalm Records (a record label) and made more music.

The band's first album to go onto many national music charts was "Tervaskanto". It was released in 2007. All of the band's albums since "Tervaskanto" have been onto many national music charts, such as charts in Finland, Germany, and Switzerland. The band's most successful album is "Jylhä." It was released in 2021. The band's current members are Järvelä, guitar player Kalle Savijärvi, bass player Jarkko Aaltonen, accordion player Sami Perttula, and drummer Samuli Mikkonen.

The band mixes folk music and metal music by using metal music instruments, such as the electric guitar and bass guitar, with folk music instruments, such as the lute, accordion, and torupill. The band also uses singing that sounds similar to joiking. Joiking is a type of Finnish folk singing. The band's lyrics are often about old Finnish religions.

Korpiklaani started in 1993, with the name Shamaani Duo. It was made by Jonne Järvelä. Shamaani Duo made folk music, with no heavy metal. The group was inspired by folk music made by the Sámi. They played most of their music in a restaurant in the Lapland. The restaurant was named Hullu Poro. In 1996, they released an album named "Hunka Lunka". This album had folk music on it. It used a type of folk singing called joiking, which the Sámi used.

After making the album, one of the members of Shamaani Duo left the band. Her name was Maaren Aikio. She was one of the singers. After she left, Järvelä changed the band's name to Shaman.

Shaman was made in 1997. It made music that was heavier than the music Shamaani Duo made. The band's music had lyrics that were spoken in the Sámi language. Many things from folk music were still used in Shaman's music, such as joiking.

The band made a demo song in 1999. It was named "Ođđa máilbmi" ("New World" in Sami). The song was put on the band's first album. The album was named "Idja". It was released on January 8, 1999. The band made a second album in 2002. It was named "Shamániac."

The band changed again in 2003. The band's new name was Korpiklaani. The only members of the band that were from Shaman were Järvelä and drummer Samu Ruotsalainen. The band's music changed to sound more similar to folk metal and thrash metal. The band stopped singing in the Sami language. They also started using real folk instruments. Järvelä has said that the band started making more heavy metal music because he worked with Finntroll. Finntroll is another folk metal band.

Korpiklaani joined a record label named Napalm Records. In Korpiklaani's first albums, the lyrics were mostly in English. Some of the music had lyrics in Finnish. However, their later albums have more music in Finnish than English. Members of Korpiklaani and Finntroll have worked together many times. Ruotsalainen has played the drums with both bands. Järvelä has also done joiking for some of Finntroll's music.

The band's first album to go onto Finland's national music chart was "Voice of Wilderness". It was the band's second album. It was released in 2005. After "Voice of Wilderness", all of the band's albums have been on national music charts. In 2008, Korpiklaani joined Nuclear Blast. This was a different record label. Their first album with Nuclear Blast was named "Korven Kuningas" (2008).

In 2011, the band released "Ukon Wacka". This album went to the number 9 place on Finland's music chart. Later in 2011, the band said Jaakko Lemmetty was leaving Korpiklaani. This was because he was having health problems. Lemmetty played many folk instruments for the band. Tuomas Rounakari replaced him.

Bruno Luigi D'Ambrosio

Bruno Luigi D'Ambrosio, (born in 9 September 1948 in Salerno (Italy), is an italian writer and businessman, who lives in Florida

His father was Pompeo D'Ambrosio, who took him to Caracas (Venezuela) at the age of 5, which is why he had dual Italian and Venezuelan nationality until he was 21 years old. Since then he is an Italian resident in the USA.

Bruno grew up studying between Caracas and Modena (Italy) where he did the Scientific High School, graduating later from the University of Genoa "summa cum laude" in "Economic Geography".

At the age of 22 he was in charge -by order of his father and his uncle Mino- of the youth section of the fans of the Venezuelan football team Deportivo Italia. (In 2001, the "International Federation of Soccer History and Statistics of FIFA" judged Deportivo Italia as the best Venezuelan soccer team of the 20th century)

After graduating he began to write when he was vice-director of the magazine "Incontri", a publication belonging to the Scalabrinian Fathers of the Catholic Church of Venezuela and written in Italian for the Italian-Venezuelan community.

He worked in the late 1970s at Saprolate-Tranarg as manager of contracts and was one of the main promotors -in a harsh way- of a single railway line in Venezuela from Maracaibo to Caracas and Ciudad Bolivar (against the tentative of corrupted latifundists of doing many railway lines -as happened years later with president Chavez- and that now are blocked facing lack of money and bankruptcy). Thanks to the "fight" of him and other managers, actually the only line created in Venezuela is the Caracas-Cua, that he promoted

After getting his MBA, Bruno Luigi D'Ambrosio founded his own company (named "Financiaria D'Ambrosio" or "Findam") in Caracas, specializing in financial advice to invest capital in various nations around the world.

Currently (2023) he lives in retirement in Boca Raton (Florida), where he continues to write and publish. He is also a promoter of the local Italian community, receiving the title of "Knight of Columbus".

In 1980 he published for the "University of Genoa" "Italian Emigration to Venezuela", his first investigative paper (in Italian and Spanish).

In subsequent years he wrote:

1- "Influence of the Spanish language on the English of the United States" (in Spanish, Italian and English)

2- "The neolatin genius of Nicola Tesla" (in English)

3- "Roman client state in Denmark" (in English)

Ashenda

Ashenda is a yearly Tigrayan festival that originated in Axum region of Tigray and has been adopted by other regions in Ethiopia and Eritrea, which celebrates women and girls. It happens every August, mostly in Tigray State where it is treated like a national holiday. The festival comes after the two weeks of Filseta. During Filseta, people fast, or do not eat, through the day. Filseta and Ashenda honor the Virgin Mary.

In the festival, young women and girls wear white cotton dresses. These dresses have colorful embroidery, called "tilfi". They also wear a lot of jewelry. They weave "ashenda" grass into a bunch, and wear it on their backs, or as a skirt. Ashenda, in the Tigrinya language, is a tall green grass that grows on river banks. Girls often wear five cornrow braids in their hair. The hair is natural. They wear Kohl eyeliner.

On the first day, the girls gather at the middle of the town or village. Then they break up into groups, and walk through the town. They sing and dance for the people in every house, and also in the village square. The people in each house give them money, food, drinks, or other gifts. The women and girls give these gifts to poor people. They sing and dance all day until sunset. This festival may last for a week or more.

Ashenda is thousands of years old. It existed even before Ethiopia became Christian, in the 4th century AD. as the Tigrayans migrated down south they brought the culture to the southern part of Ethiopia it was adopted reflecting the spirit and culture of the locals developing new name E.g in Wello region it's called Shadey, Agew Awi Zone they call is Ashendye, in Gojjam and Shewa region they call it Solel, or Mariya.

According to old stories, King Menelik I of Ethiopia was the son of the ancient Israelite king Solomon. He traveled to Ethiopia with other Israelites in the 10th century BC. In modern times, Jews lived in Ethiopia: the Beta Israel people. Researcher Timkehet Teffera thinks that Ashenda started as an ancient Israelite celebration. Other people think that Ashenda was once a pagan festival. They think it started to celebrate the harvest season, or as a time for women and men to find partners for marriage.

Ethiopia became Christian in the 4th century AD. The meaning of Ashenda changed to focus on the Virgin Mary. It is mainly celebrated in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. This church says that after Mary died, the Apostles fasted for 14 days. On the 15th day, they buried her. So Ethiopians fast for the first 15 days of "Nahase", a month in the Ethiopian calendar. On the 16th day, Mary rose from the grave. God carried her to Heaven. This event is called the Assumption of Mary. Ashenda starts on "Nahase" 16th, in honor of the Assumption.

The story says that Mary rose from a glowing field of tall grass. Some say that the ashenda grass represents this field. Others say that it is related to the story of Moses. When Moses was born, the king of Egypt said to kill all baby Israelite boys. Moses' mother had to hide her son to save his life. She hid him in a basket in the grasses by a river. The king's daughter found Moses and raised him in secret. One popular Ashenda song is about Moses.

Girls usually wear a white cotton dress. People weave these dresses by hand, without a machine. They put colorful embroidery patterns on the dresses. However, now some girls wear colorful cloths from other countries. Girls usually tie a band of cotton cloth around their waist. They often wear plastic shoes. The girls' hair is braided. A few days before the festival, girls go to local hairdressers. They can braid hair in many complex ways. The girls wear many types of jewelry. It can be made of gold, silver, brass, copper, seashells, coconut shells, beads, or twisted threads. They often wear necklaces, bracelets, and ankle bracelets. They traditionally wear Kohl eyeliner on their face. Today, they also wear other kinds of makeup, or cosmetics. Many girls paint crosses on their forehead.

Many families buy new clothing and jewelry for Ashenda. If the family does not have enough money to buy clothing, neighbors or relatives will lend it to them. Each group of girls plans what they will wear for Ashenda, so they can all wear the same style.

Ashenda involves singing, dancing, and playing drums. Older family members, especially mothers, teach Ashenda traditions to the girls. Most Ashenda groups have at least one boy with them. Traditionally, boys walk with the girls to protect them. During Ashenda, girls meet many different people. So it can also be a time to find a husband.

On the first day of Ashenda, girls go to a church and pray. They then sing songs of praise to St. Mary. After this, they go to houses and sing and dance. The people in each house usually give them gifts. Some common gifts are chicken stew, honey wine, local beer, and money. Then the girls sing a special song to thank them.

Some Ashenda songs are about political topics. They may criticize people in the village, or in the government. The girls are free to say anything they want in their songs. Tradition says that nobody can stop them from talking. Girls in Ethiopia do not usually have this freedom. So Ashenda is a special time for them. Ashenda songs may also say nice things about people in the town. Girls may sing about unity and belonging. They may sing about the joy of the celebration.

The songs are usually sung in two parts: the group leader, and everyone else. They are often sung as an antiphon, or call and response. The drum and hand claps keep a rhythm.

Social care

Social care is the name for help people get when they cannot do things for themselves which most people do. It includes getting out of bed, getting dressed, washing, eating and moving about and staying safe. People who need social care include hospital patients who need help after an operation, people with physical or learning disabilities who want to live independently at home, and young people from difficult families and children in foster care. 

This sort of help is mostly done by families, and mostly by women. In the past a lot was done by religious people. Workhouses and hospitals were often full of people who needed social care and had nobody to look after them. As medicine developed social care became more separate. Payment for health care is often different from payments for health care. There may be argument about who should pay. Care for old people near the end of life is very different from care for children and young people. Private insurance is not very successful. Not everyone needs social care and young people are reluctant to take out insurance. Germany and Japan have set up systems which try to balance society’s and a individual responsibilities. 

Local governments in many countries set up large homes for old people. People with mental illness or learning difficulty often lived in big hospitals for years. These institutions have mostly closed and now more people get help in their own homes or in group homes. They may pay for it, or in a welfare state it may be free. More people need social care as more people live to be old and people survive with conditions which in earlier times would have meant an early death. 

Social workers are employed to make decisions about the help people need if the government is paying. The people who are paid do this work may be called care workers. They are mostly women and the pay is low. People often leave for better paid work in retail. 

The State of Guernsey said in November 2022 that it would have to cut back social care because people were living longer with more needs. It was hard to find enough people to do the work.

Martyrs Shrine

Martyr's shrines () are religious buildings in China that honor and remember people who died for their country. They are built separately from other buildings and can be converted from other types of shrines such as Shinto shrines. They also help teach people about the importance of loyalty and righteousness and Confucian values.
In China, there were shrines that honored loyal people and soldiers who died for their country. The emperor gave the shrines their names. One of these shrines, called Fayuan Temple, was built to remember soldiers who died in battle. It was first named Jienzhongsa Temple but later renamed Fayuan Temple. This tradition also spread to other places like Korea and Vietnam. When the monarchy ended, the government continued to make shrines for the martyrs.

Originally, many of the shrines in Taiwan that remember people who died while serving their country were Shinto shrines. After World War II, the Nationalist government converted them to their current use. These shrines are dedicated to officers, soldiers, police, and people who died for the Republic of China.

According to the "Rules for the Sacrifice of Martyrs' Shrines" by the Ministry of the Interior of the R.O.C., these shrines are located at municipal governments in cities and counties. The National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine is located in the central government seat and the President leads the ceremony.

In 1998, a legal amendment allowed civilians who were not in the military to be inducted into the shrine. The first civilian to be inducted was Lin Ching-chuan, a teacher who died saving children in a fire. Some police officers, firefighters, and healthcare workers who died in the line of duty, as well as postal workers who died while serving, have also been commemorated at the shrine..

During the Imperial era in Japan, Shōkonsha was established to honor those who gave their lives for the country. During the war, they were renamed Gokoku Shrines, except for Tokyo Shrine, which became known as Yasukuni Shrine. Some people consider the shrine to be a symbol of Japanese militarism. The shrine has a list of over 2 million people and pets, including the names, origins, birthdates, and places of death. Unfortunately, controversy surrounds the shrine because it also includes the names of over 1,000 convicted war criminals, including 14 who were involved in the planning and initiation of the war.

Amazon Women in the Mood

"Amazon Women in the Mood" is an episode of the television show "Futurama". It is the first episode of season three to be made, but it was not the first one that was on television. It was first shown on the Fox network in the United States on February 4, 2001.

Amy has a phone call. The caller makes strange sounds and then hangs up. The caller is Kif. Kif loves Amy but is afraid to talk to her. Zapp Brannigan hears that Kif loves Amy and that Amy works with Leela, so he asks Leela to come out with him and Kif and bring Amy as a double date. Leela agrees but only because Amy wants to go. The four of them go to a restaurant on a large spaceship.

The date is bad, and Zapp crashes the restaurant ship into a strange planet. This planet is Amazonia. The Amazonians, a tribe of giant, muscular women, catch Kif, Zapp, Leela, and Amy.

Fry and Bender go to Amazonia to save their friends but the Amazonians catch them too. Fry, Zapp, and Bender make jokes about the Amazonian's female ideas, which makes Leela and Amy think life without men would be good. The Amazonians ask what purpose men. Amy tries to answer, and the Amazonians realize she is describing "snu-snu" (sexual intercourse), something they have heard of but never done.

The Amazonians' leader, a giant computer called Femputer (Bea Arthur), decides to punish the men. Bender says that he does not have male anatomy, so the Femputer lets him leave. Femputer says Zapp, Fry, and Kif are must die, but she says it will be "death by snu-snu," meaning the Amazonians will have sex with them until they are dead. Kif does not want to die by snu-snu, but Zapp and Fry are both happy and upset. Fry says, "I never thought I'd die like this, but I'd always really hoped." Kif tells Amy that he loves her. Amy resolves to save him.

Zapp and Fry are snu-snued off-screen. Kif climbs to the ceiling and escapes from at least one of the Amazonians. Later, both Zapp and Fry ask for the snu-snuing to stop because they are tired, but the Amazonians continue.

Leela and Amy tell Bender to find the Femputer and reprogram her to let the men live. He sees that the Femputer is a really fembot. She tells Bender that she created the Amazonian society because her home planet was ruled by mean men. Amy rescues Kif; the Amazonians chase after them, cornering them in the Femputer's chamber. By this time, however, Bender and the fembot have become romantic. They tell the Amazonians to release their captives and bring gold.

The crew returns to Earth where Fry and Zapp receive treatment for broken hip bones, but they are both happy that they had snu-snu. Bender has a pile of gold bricks, and Kif and Amy are a couple. They all agree that Amazonia was their best mission ever.

The episode's title comes from the movie "Amazon Women on the Moon". At the space restaurant, Zapp sings "Lola" to Leela. This a parody of William Shatner trying to sing "Rocket Man." The bar "Le'Palm d'Orbit" is a reference to "Palme d'Or." Zapp calls himself "the Velour Fog" because sing Mel Torme's nickname is "the Velvet Fog."

The episode has what "Science Fiction Weekly" calls the "stereotypical women's fantasy"—a world without men. This happens much in science fiction. It says that this represents the desire "not to be marginalized in one's own society."

This episode was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2001 for "Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)" but lost to "The Simpsons" episode "HOMR." In 2006, IGN named it the best episode of "Futurama" because it is both "crude and hilarious." The episode was also called "most hilarious" episode in Futurama's third season by "Curve" and in the book "5000 Episodes and No Commercials: The Ultimate Guide to TV Shows on DVD". In 2013, it was ranked number 10 "as voted on by fans" for Comedy Central's Futurama Fanarama marathon.

When it was first on television in 2001, the episode placed 79th in the Nielsen ratings for primetime shows for the week of January 29 - February 4, 2001.

Many years later, there were new reviews and articles about the episode. These articles talk about how the men do not really agree to have sex and that this is bad. They also say the episode has other unhealthy ideas about what it means to be a man or woman. In 2021, Jonah Schuhart of the "Looper" writes "much of the episode's humor crosses into borderline misogyny, and even makes light of sexual assault." In 2023, Lewis Morton of the "Avocado" writes "the only people who undergo snu-snu are consenting enthusiastically, but then if you have to go out of your way to explain why something isn’t rape, you're probably already too far."

Housing Benefit

Housing Benefit is a means tested social security benefit in the United Kingdom that is intended to help with the costs of rent. 

Rent rebates, as they were called, started in the 1930s when council houses were built to clear slums. The rents were often to high for the poor people who had lived in the slums. Local councils made their own arrangements. The first national system started in 1972. It covered rates as well as rent. For people in private housing it was called rent allowance. People who got Supplementary Benefit had all their rent paid. People who had more money than that still got some help. By 1983 about 30% of the population were getting Housing Benefit. After 1986 it was lined up with the rules for Income Support. 

The cost of housing for low-income households has risen a lot. The cost of Housing Benefit rose from 0.2% of GDP in 1980-81 to 1.0% in 2012-13. In 2015 £9.3 billion was paid to private landlords. 

From 2019 housing benefit was moved into Universal Credit except for people above State Pension age and people living in supported, sheltered or temporary housing.

in 2022 2 million private renting households, 38% of the total, were getting help with rent from either Universal Credit or Housing Benefit.

Private tenants can only claim for a rent up the level of the Local Housing Allowance where they live. This is based on private market rents being paid by tenants in a Broad Rental Market Area. Local Housing Allowance started in 2008. There are rules about number of bedrooms a household can claim for. They do not apply to pensioners. 

From April 2011 claimants could only claim a rent based on the 30th percentile of rent in their area. Single people under 35 could only claim for the cost of a shared room. care leavers aged under 22, some people who have a disability and over 25s who have spent at least three months living in hostel accommodation, can sometimes claim for a self-contained one bedroom flat . The maximum payable under LHA was also set to £400 per week, or £20,800 per annum. The Local Housing Allowance was fixed in April 2020 but not changed since then as rents increased. In February 2023 in Wales out of 2,638 private properties advertised for rent only 32 had rent under the allowance. 

In 2023 the Chancellor announced that the Local Housing Allowance would be re-pegged to the 30th percentile of local rents in April 2024, but it would then be frozen again.

Housing benefit is also limited by the benefit cap, which has not been increased."."

Wulfstan

Wulfstan (d.1023) is known to be an influential monk and a remarkable writer of homilies. 

It is speculated that he was born in York, not far from the Ship of the Fens, namely the Ely Cathedral. His date of birth remains a mystery to this day. It is also speculated that he was born into a family that owned lands which they lost upon the arrival of the Danish Warrior, King Cnut, in England in 1016. King Cnut is often described as the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history.

Wulfstan received a Benedictine education at Winchester (a foundation that houses the relics of the saint who founded Western monasticism in the 7th century). Winchester became known as the center of the Benedictine reform in England in the late 10th century. Wulfstan was later elevated to bishop of London in 996-1002, and then he became the archbishop of York from 1002 to 1016. Wulfstan was familiar with the Benedictine Reform movement. This movement sought to free monasteries from secular control and to establish a more committed discipline among monks. Wulfstan was the student and the disciple of Æthelwold of Winchester, which allowed him to write The Life of St. Æthelwold in 1000. 

Almost nothing is known about Wulfstan’s youth, only that part of his family probably lived in the Fenland area of the East Midlands. Because of his later career and association with the Benedictine Reform, he possibly once studied and worked as a Benedictine monk at Winchester. In 996, he became the bishop of London. In 1002, he was elected Archbishop of York, and later he gained control over the district of Worcester. 

Wulfstan thought that the reign of king Æthelred was full of sin and he saw it as a period of failure. That is why he wanted to create new law codes to make things better. Besides that, he also created laws for the Danish king Cnut, who took England’s throne in 1016. He was an important person in England at that time, because of his control over the district of York. Wulfstan was also a prominent figure in the royal court since he was the legal craftsman for both Æthelred and Cnut. 

As a bishop – and later archbishop – Wulfstan was very active in church reform. He emphasized the importance of the church in the education of the people as well as in aiding the king. His religious efforts eventually started to include even secular matters, such as the legal writing mentioned earlier. This was partly to make sure that the church would still be able to interfere with secular matters. 

Wulfstan is known as one of the most notable and unique Old English writers. He was best known for his religious texts (homilies, sermons, religious canon) but also for political theory and writing of laws. Wulfstan was one of the two major writers in early 11th century England. His writing of religious text was influenced by Benedictine Reform - which tried to unite the rules for monks, including the promotion of regular life for priests and a strict church order. Wulfstan used his homilies to teach priests and monks. 

Wulfstan’s homilies had a few specific details, his special rhythmical system being one of them. Wulfstan also used specific vocabulary and frequently repeating literary devices. 

Wulfstan’s works were appreciated by people living at that time as well. Wulfstan’s works are so complex that they were impossible to be translated. Wulfstan knew his audience well, his works were written for an average English Christian. His writings were great in number, it is noted that he wrote over 30 sermons in Old English. 

The motive of Wulfstan’s works was often religious, depicting the evil of the world before the second coming of Christ, a motive that can be seen in his work "Evil Days". One of his works, "Secundum Lucam", describes how terrible hell is. 

His works were often influenced by the political situation at that time, addressing social instability. 

Wulfstan influenced other writers of homilies. Sometimes it is hard to decide whether a work was actually written by Wulfstan because they followed his composition and rhetoric. One of the most famous imitations was by Napier, as his works were essentially his version of Wulfstan’s homilies. One important fact to note is that even though Wulfstan’s works are often referred to as homilies, they are actually in fact sermons since Wulfstan does not present his ideas phrase by phrase, he only uses a general theme for his sermon.
