Sandra Gonzalez of "Entertainment Weekly" commented on the news about the cast leaving. She said: "Indeed, a rolling cast list has done some shows good in the past. I'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the 'new kids' on "Friday Night Lights", which ends its run tomorrow on NBC, but it was a well-done transition. What I loved most was that the new blood (group) didn't (did not) try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. "Glee" could learn a lot from what "Friday Night Lights" accomplished (have done successfully): a seamless, realistic (real) transition (change). The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been "Glee"s strong points, which is not to say they couldn't (could not) be. But the question is: Is "Glee" looking to be the less-attractive comedy cousin of "Friday Night Lights"… or "Saved By the Bell: The New Class"?"

Michele took the role as Rachel because of her characterization. Michele explained: "Not only is she a singer, but she has so much heart—I think it's what we need on TV. A show that is filled with heart and love that is funny. It sends an amazing message to kids about the arts and being who you are." Michele described the first thirteen episodes of "Glee". She described it as: "Rachel's journey of finding herself within the glee club". She also said that "she's learning how to be a team player and work within this group. She's a very strong, driven girl, who's (who is) sometimes a little misunderstood."

"Glee"s costume designer Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costumes. Eyrich told "Entertainment Weekly": "Originally (at first), the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from "Election"—very buttoned-down (someone who is serious in the job they are doing), preppy (someone who looks like a high school student), obnoxious (not very well liked by people), squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen (television) and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls find a way to make it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong."

Michele have stated that she was just like Rachel when she was younger. She also gets inspiration from the movie "Election", and "Gossip Girl" character Blair Waldorf. She has explained: "[Blair] is shady (a mean person), but you still love her. She's still vulnerable (easy to get hurt). That's what I try to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't (are not) considered beautiful, and when I was in high school it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't (does not) matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of that crap won't (will not) matter anyway."

Some songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as digital download singles. They were also on the soundtrack albums, "Glee: The Music, Volume 1" and "Glee: The Music, Volume 2". Rachel has received positive reviews from critics. Michele was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series" in 2010. She also was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for "Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy" in 2010. Robert A. George of the "New York Post" stated "the only female [in Glee] who doesn't (does not) come across as manipulative (easy to tell someone what to do) or vapidly (nothing good about her) helpless" (not able to help her own self). "Chicago Tribune"s Maureen Ryan wrote, "Lea Michele not only has an amazing voice but manages to make her character, spoiled (get's whatever she wants in life) diva Rachel Berry, more than a humorless (not funny) stereotype." Denise Martin of "The Los Angeles Times" commented in her review of the episode "The Rhodes Not Taken": "if there's any justice in the world, Lea Michele will win a Golden Globe and an Emmy for playing Rachel".

In the episode "Hairography", Kurt Hummel gives Rachel a bad make over. Mike Hale of the "New York Times" remembered a popular theme that critics give negative reviews because of the way "Glee" treats its female characters. Hale said that he understands why, but also says that the show equally treats male characters the same. However, he wrote that "it was a bit much when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said she looked like a 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic (really good)." Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh commented: "when we saw Rachel fall for them (Finn and Puck), she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A (best), uber-talented, self-involved (gets into things by herself) know-it-all (a person who believes they know everything) who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose (to show) a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships."

Michele has won a number of awards for her portrayal of Rachel. Michele won the Satellite Awards for "Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical or Comedy Television Series" in 2009. She also won, as part of the cast, for "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 2010, Michele won the NewNowNext Awards for "Brink of Fame: Actor". In 2009, she was nominated for a Teen Choice Awards in the category "Choice TV Breakout Star". That same year, Michele was nominated for a Golden Globe for "Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy". She also was nominated for an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series". She received another Teen Choice Award nomination in 2010 for "Choice TV Actress: Comedy". Michele was included in "Time" magazine's 2010 list of the "100 Most Influential People In the World". Her cover of The All-American Rejects' "Gives You Hell" reached the top 40 on the US "Billboard" 200. Michele is featured as lead singer in 14 of the top 20 selling Glee Cast songs as of 2010. She won the 2012 People's Choice Award for "Favorite TV Comedy Actress".

Michele was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2011. The first for "Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals" ("Don't Stop Believin"). The second for "Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media" ("Glee: The Music, Volume 1"). Michele said of the first Grammy nomination: "I like that it's for 'Don't Stop Believin", which is for the whole cast, so that we all get to go. That's just awesome." She was nominated again for "Best Actress- Television Series Musical or Comedy" at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards. The cast of Glee was also nominated for the "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" award at the 2011 and 2012 Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Tilla Jogian is the highest hill in District Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan. Its height is . It is about from Jhelum city. Tilla Jogian can be seen from the nearby districts. There is as a ruined old temple and water tank on top of the Tilla Jogian.

It is said or claimed by various people that the temple of Tilla Jogian was founded in 100 B.C by the "Kan-Phatta" sect of Hindu "Jogis" and the name of this place is in fact derived from this i.e. 'Tilla' (Hill)and 'Jogian' (of the Jogis). Later, Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism also spent some time here.

Hermaphroditus

In Greek mythology, Hermaphroditus was the two-sexed son of Hermes and Aphrodite. He was a minor god of androgeny, effeminacy and hermaphroditism. He also symbolized the unity of male and female. He was one of the members of the Erotes, a group of winged love gods. His name is the origin of the word hermaphrodite.

According to a myth of Ovid, he was raised by nymphs in a cave on Mount Ida. At the age of fifteen, he traveled to the cities of Lydia and Caria in Asia Minor. It was there that he came upon a pool of fresh water. He undressed and bathed in the pool. Meanwhile, the nymph of the pool Salmacis, fell in love with him. She jumped into the pool and embraced him, not letting go, he struggled to get away from her. Salmacis prayed to the gods that they should never separate and the gods hearing her prayer, merged their bodies together, transforming Hermaphroditus into an androgynous being. Hermaphroditus, in anger of his transformation, cursed the pool so that anyone who bathed in it would suffer the same fate.

The worship of Hermaphroditus originated from Cyprus, under the name of Aphroditus. The cult was introduced into mainland Greece around the late 5th century BC. At rituals and sacrifices to the god, worshipers cross-dressed; men wearing women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing. The god was also identified with the moon, because the moon was thought to be both male and female.

Hermaphroditus was a popular subject in ancient Greek and Roman art. He is often shown alone and sometimes interacting with satyrs and cupids. There is a famous statue called "The Sleeping Hermaphroditus" at the Louvre Museum in Paris. 

Max Payne

Max Payne is a third-person shooter video game made by Finnish developers Remedy Entertainment and published by Gathering of Developers in July 2001 for Microsoft Windows. Later in 2001, ports for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameBoy Advance were published by Rockstar Games. A Macintosh port was published in July 2002 by MacSoft in North America, and by Feral Interactive in the rest of the world. There were plans for a Dreamcast version of "Max Payne", but they were cancelled because of the console had stopped being made. The game was again released in April 2009 as a downloadable game for the Xbox Originals program for the Xbox 360.

The game features a neo-noir type style and uses comic strips (with voice-overs) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game. This is because it is inspired by hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. The game contains many references to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of Ragnarök. Several of the names used in the game are those of Norse gods. The gameplay is very much influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo, and it was the first game to feature the bullet time effect made famous in "The Matrix".

"Max Payne" got very good reviews from critics and was praised for its exciting gun play and use of noir storytelling devices. As of 2012, the "Max Payne" franchise has sold over 7.5 million copies. The game has also won a BAFTA Award.

The game was followed by "", released in 2003. And "Max Payne 3", released in 2012.


Nautiloid

Nautiloids are a large and varied group of marine cephalopods (Mollusca) in the subclass Nautiloidea. They began in the later Cambrian. "Nautilus" is the only surviving genus. 

Nautiloids flourished during the early Palaeozoic era, when they were the main predatory animals. They developed an extraordinary range of shell shapes and forms. Some 2,500 species of fossil nautiloids are known, though only a few species survive today.

Nautiloids are among the group of animals known as cephalopods. The cephalopods are an advanced class of molluscs. The cephalopods also include ammonoids, Belemnites and modern coleoids such as octopus and squid. 

Traditionally, the most common classification of the cephalopods has been a three-fold division into the nautiloids, ammonoids, and coleoids. This article is about nautiloids in that broad sense, sometimes called Nautiloidea "sensu lato".

Cladistically speaking, nautiloids are a paraphyletic group united by shared primitive (basal) features not found in derived cephalopods. In other words, they are a evolutionary grade that is thought to have given rise to both ammonoids and coleoids. They are defined by the exclusion of both those descendent groups. Both ammonoids and coleoids probably descended from bactritids, which in turn arose from straight-shelled orthocerid nautiloids. 

The ammonoids (a group which includes the ammonites and the goniatites) are extinct cousins of the nautiloids which evolved early in the Devonian, some 400 million years ago.

Aphroditus

The worship of Aphroditus comes from Cyprus, a cult of a masculine or hermaphrodite form of Aphrodite. The divinity was introduced into Greece and celebrated in Athens in a cross-dressing ritual.

It is thought that Hesiod's myth, explaining the birth of Aphrodite, born when Cronus cut off the genitals of Uranus and threw it into the sea, originated from the cult of Aphroditus. A terracotta plaque from the 7th century BC found at Perachora in Greece, representing Aphroditus emerging from severed male genitals, suggests this, as there are two different myths of the creation of Aphrodite.

According to Macrobius, Aphroditus was represented in Cyprus with a beard and phallus, wearing female clothing and holding a scepter. At sacrifices to the god, worshipers cross-dressed, men wearing women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing. The cult spread from Cyprus into southern Asia Minor, eventually reaching mainland Greece around the late 5th century BC. In Athens, the iconography of the god took on the "anasyromenos" pose, a female figure lifting her dress to reveal an erect phallus, a gesture that had apotropaic qualities, much like the god Priapus. By the Hellenistic period, the cult and votives had spread throughout Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy.

Gradually over time the cult lost popularity, Aphroditus was also being called Hermaphroditus, which originally meant Aphroditus in the form of a herm or "a herm of Aphroditus". These were marble or bronze sculptures with a head or torso above a plain rectangular pillar, a symbol of fertility. In later Greek mythology, Hermaphroditus came to be known as the son of Hermes and Aphrodite.

Trait (disambiguation)

Trait may refer to:



Trait theory

In psychology, trait theory is a the study of human personality. Trait theorists are interested in the measurement of "traits", which can be defined as habitual patterns of behaviour, thought, and emotion.

Trait (album)

Trait is the first, and only, EP by the industrial rock/metal band Pailhead. The original EP was released in 1988, containing the first four songs in a slightly different order. When re-released on CD in the early 90's, the group's first single ("I Will Refuse" b/w "No Bunny" 12") was added as a bonus.





Trait (computer programming)

In computer programming, a trait is a collection of methods. A trait is used to build a simple model for object oriented programs. A trait is a building block for classes. It makes an easy way to reuse code.

Granger, Indiana

Granger is a city in Indiana in the United States.

Transuranium element

A transuranium element is any chemical element that comes after Uranium in the periodic table. These elements have atomic numbers greater than 92. All transuranium elements are radioactive, and none are found in nature except Neptunium and Plutonium. An element that is radioactive will decay into other elements.

From what we do know about the transuranium elements, as the atomic number goes up, the more radioactive it gets. Some isotopes have very long half-lives, such as Americium-243 having a half life of 7370 years. Others do not, like Tennessine-294 which has a half life of 51 milliseconds. 

The applications of them are used far and wide, like how Uranium and Plutonium are used for fuel and weapons, Curium is used for rovers, Berkelium is used for creating other elements, notably Tennessine, and Americium being used for smoke detectors. Fermium to Lawrencium really don't have uses and after that, what scientists call superheavy elements are Rutherfordium to Oganesson, which also have no uses.

Stupendemys

Stupendemys is a prehistoric genus of freshwater turtle. Its fossils have been found in northern South America, in rocks dating from the late Miocene to the very start of the Pliocene, about 6 to 5 million years ago.

"Stupendemys"'s carapace measured over in length and was also very wide. With a total carapace length of at least 11 feet (3.3 m) it was the largest turtle that ever existed, surpassing even "Archelon". 

Two species have been described to date. "Stupendemys geographicus" from Venezuela, and "Stupendemys souzai", a bit smaller and more slender, from Brazil.

Its weight helped "Stupendemys" stay under water for long periods, grazing on aquatic plants. It was probably a very weak swimmer, unable to move its bulk against a swift current, and probably avoided smaller streams.

Altogether, the fauna of the time had many large herbivores and few terrestrial carnivores. The habitat was mostly low-lying rainforest that was seasonally flooded, as well as floodplains and swampland. The rivers must have been wide and slow-moving.

Carol Greider

Carolyn Widney "Carol" Greider (born April 15, 1961) is an American molecular biologist. She is Professor and Director of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins University. 

Greider discovered the enzyme telomerase in 1984, when she was a graduate student of Elizabeth Blackburn at the University of California, Berkeley. Greider pioneered research on the structure of telomeres, the ends of the chromosomes. She was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, with Blackburn and Jack Szostak, for their discovery that telomeres are protected from progressive shortening by the enzyme telomerase.

Telomerase

Telomerase is an RNA protein which is an enzyme. It adds DNA sequence repeats ("TTAGGG" in all vertebrates) to the end of DNA strands in the telomere regions. 

The telomeres are disposable buffers blocking the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. They are a region of repeated nucleotides containing noncoding DNA. Telomeres are destroyed during cell division, and are remade by the enzyme telomerase.

The function of telomeres is to avoid the loss of important DNA from chromosome ends. Every time the chromosome is copied 100–200 meaningless nucleotides are lost, which causes no damage to the organism's DNA. So, the telomeres are shortened after each replication cycle, and then are restored to their proper length by telomerase. Telomerases carry their own RNA molecule, which is used as a template to elongate the telomeres.

The existence of a compensatory mechanism (a 'fix') for telomere shortening was first predicted by Soviet biologist Alexey Olovnikov in 1973. He also suggested the telomere hypothesis of ageing and the telomere's connections to cancer. 

Telomerase was discovered by Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn in 1984 in the ciliate "Tetrahymena". Together with Jack Szostak, Greider and Blackburn were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery.

Luc Montagnier

Luc Antoine Montagnier (18 August 1932 – 8 February 2022) was a French virologist and joint recipient with Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Harald zur Hausen of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for the discovery made by his team, and particularly Françoise Baré-Sinoussi of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He worked as a full-time professor at Shanghai Jiaotong University.

He has been discredited by his Nobel peers because of the many fake and dangerous theories he tries to spread, such as "" or Papaya Cure for AIDS or Parkinson disease. In 2009 he published two controversial research studies which, if true, "would be the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry".
Homeopaths claim his research as support for homeopathy, but Montagnier himself says it cannot be extended to homeopathy. Many scientists have greeted it with scorn and harsh criticism.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Montagnier also supported the conspiracy theory that SARS-CoV-2 was created and escaped from a laboratory.

He received the Legion of Honour.

Montagnier died on 8 February 2022 at a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France at the age of 89.

The oldest glee clubs in the United States are the Harvard Glee Club, founded in 1858.


Teamwork

Teamwork is when many people work together. They work together to reach a goal. Teamwork helps people to understand others, build friendly friendships, and to get any job done the right way. In health care, teamwork is often practiced to help patients at the hospital. All team members are given a job to do. In teamwork, all work is shared.

Interracial marriage

An interracial marriage is a marriage between two people of different races. In some cases it violates a rule requiring endogamy. In some countries, it was against the law to marry someone of a different race. These countries included, Germany (during the Nazi period), South Africa under apartheid, and some U.S. states in the United States before a 1967 ruling.

The United Nations "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights" which granted the right to marriage "without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion" was enacted in 1948. It is now accepted in principle in most of the world. 

Interracial

Interracial means two people of two different races.


Same-sex relationship

A same sex relationship is a type of relationship between two people of the same sex. The term is associated with the LGBT community. In many countries it is against the law to be in a relationship and have sex with the same gender. Same-sex relationships have been recorded in history. The earliest is from Egyptian royal servants Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum in the 25th century BC. It is often known as the earliest homosexual relationship couple.

Ra.One

Ra.One is a 2011 Indian science fiction superhero movie. It was released on October 26, 2011. The main characters of the it are "G.One", Shekhar Subramaniam (both played by Shahrukh Khan), and "Ra.One" (played by Arjun Rampal). It also stars Kareena Kapoor, Armaan Verma, Shahana Goswami, Tom Wu, Dalip Tahil and Satish Shah in supporting roles. 

In 2010, London, Jenny Nair, an employee of UK-based company Barron Industries, introduces a new technology that allows objects from the digital world to enter the real world using the wireless transmissions from multiple devices. Shekhar Subramanium, who also works for the company, is given a final chance to devise with a video game with a difference. To impress his sceptical son Prateek, and upon the request of his wife Sonia, Subramanium uses his son's idea that the antagonist be more powerful than the protagonist.

Shekhar's colleague Akashi provides the moves of the game's characters, Jenny does the programming and Shekhar gives his face to the game's protagonist G.One, whilst the antagonist Ra.One is faceless and has substantially greater powers than those granted to G.One, including shapeshifting. Ra.One is imbibed with a self-learning artificial intelligence. The game has three levels, and either of the players can only be killed in the third level using a special gun that holds a single bullet. While designing the game, Akashi notices some malfunctions but ignores them. When the game is finally launched, it receives a standing ovation and Prateek loves it so much that he insists on playing it instantly. He logs in under the alias 'Lucifer' and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Akashi. The self-aware Ra.One, being unable to end his turn with Lucifer, becomes determined that Lucifer shall die. When the mainframe fails to shut down, Akashi calls Shekhar, who notices a problem with the game. Ra.One uses the new technology to enter the real world and breaks free and goes to find Lucifer.

Ra One first threatens Akashi and asks him where Lucifer is. When Akashi fails to reply, Ra One abruptly abducts and murders him. After Shekhar finds the dead Akashi, he rushes home; however, he is found by Ra.One. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer. However, Ra.One scans Shekhar's I.D. and, discovering he has lied, kills him. Prateek notices the strange circumstances of his father's death and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He and Jenny attempt to bring G.One to life. Meanwhile, Sonia tells Prateek that the family will return to India. Having taken the form of Akashi, Ra.One chases them, but G.One enters the real world through Jenny's computer and causes a gas explosion which saves them and temporarily destroys Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T., without which Ra.One is weakened. Sonia finds she cannot leave G.One and takes him along with them to India through Shekhar's passport. G.One promises Sonia that he will protect Prateek from any harm. Ra.One returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model, and tracks G.One and Prateek.

During Prateek's birthday party, Ra.One hypnotises Sonia, assumes her form and kidnaps Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in an uncontrollable Mumbai Suburban Railway train. G.One saves Sonia just in the nick of time (though the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus is destroyed) and returns to save Prateek. The game resumes, with Prateek controlling G.One's moves. Following a lengthy fight, both of the characters reach the third level. With little power left, G.One and Prateek trick Ra.One into shooting G.One without his H.A.R.T. attached, which leaves Ra.One helpless. Furious, Ra.One creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to differentiate the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote one of Shekhar's sayings: "If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you". The pair then realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him, and after absorbing Ra.One's remains, transports himself back into the digital world.

Several months later, Prateek and Sonia return to the UK, where Prateek finally manages to restore G.One to the real world, much to his and his mother's joy.

Downtown MRT line

The Downtown Line (DTL), will be the fifth Mass Rapid Transport line in Singapore, the third to be completely underground, and with 3-car trains, the second medium capacity line. Currently in various stages of construction, it will open up in phases, such as Stage 1 in 2013, Stage 2 in 2015 and Stage 3 in 2017. The line is colored blue on the MRT Rail map.

The downtown line starts in Bukit Panjang, where it then passes through the Creative cluster and school belt of Bukit Timah. Along the way, it passes through many food enclaves, such as at Newton. It then passes through the downtown core and financial district before heading east, towards Bedok and Tampenies and the Singapore Expo.

Stage 1 of the Downtown Line was originally planned as the Downtown Extension of the Circle Line since 2005. It was planned to have 6 stations from Bugis and end at Chinatown. It opened on 22 December 2013. The section usually parallels Circle Line from Bayfront to Promenade.

Stage 2 was originally planned as the Bukit Timah Line, and was to terminate at Nicoll Highway, but plans were changed after the Nicoll highway collapse, which deemed the original station unfit for use. It was merged with the Downtown Line in 2005. It opened on 27 December 2015.

Stage 3 was originally planned as the Eastern Region Line, and was meant to relieve congestion on the East West Line. The northern part of the line from Expo to Chinatown was replaced by Downtown Line Stage 3 and opened on 21 October 2017.

Stage 3e is a two station extension that would link the Downtown Line and the Thomson Line at Sungei Bedok. It would be completed around 2024.

Below are the announced station names for all four stages of the Downtown Line.

Lee Hartwell

Leland Harrison (Lee) Hartwell (born October 30, 1939, in Los Angeles, California) is former president and director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. He shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Paul Nurse and Tim Hunt, for their discoveries of protein molecules that control cell division.

When cells divide, they divide in phases called G1 (growth), S (synthesis), G2 (growth), and M (mitosis). Nurse, Hartwell and Hunt together discovered two proteins, cyclin and CDK (cyclin dependent kinase), which control the change from one stage to another. These proteins are called "checkpoints", because they check whether the cell has divided properly. If the cell does not divide correctly, other proteins will try to repair it. If that does not work, they will destroy the cell. If a cell divides incorrectly and survives, it may cause cancer and other serious diseases.

Working in baker's yeast ("Saccharomyces cerevisiae"), Hartwell identified the fundamental role of checkpoints in cell cycle control, and CDC genes such as CDC28, which controls the start of the cycle – the progression through G1.

Formula One car

A Formula One car is a racing car used in Formula One races. They have one seat, which is open to the air. They have aerodynamic wings on their front and rear, and the engine is positioned behind the driver. The regulations governing the cars are unique to the Formula One championship. The regulations say that cars must be built by the racing teams themselves, though the design and manufacture can be done by others.

F1 Cars have technology to make them faster, more drag resistant and safer. Some of this technology is described below.

ERS stand for Energy Recovery Systems. There are two basic types of ERS systems - mechanical and electrical and both recover energy without using fuel and damaging the environment. The rule to use KERS was introduced by the FIA in 2009. It works by storing energy in a flywheel or battery (like the one on the right) that would be lost when braking, and allow that energy to be re-used when accelerating. ERS was introduced in 2014 to activate wherever a driver chose permanently throughout a race weekend

This is used a lot in corners because it controls the wheel spin when under and over steering. They mean simply to which end of the car runs out of grip first as the tyres only have limited amount of grip. In an under steer, the front axle and wheels runs out of grip first and in Over steer the rear end runs out first. When this happens it is like a handbrake skid. Traction Control is the device that tries to keep the car stable by adjusting the wheel movement in these turns.

DRS stands for Drag Reduction System. It is an addition to the rear wing of the car introduced in 2011 Formula 1 season aimed at reducing aerodynamic drag in order to promote overtaking. It is used when a driver is close to somebody in front of him. He will be able to open the rear wing so the car becomes more streamline and aerodynamic so he can overtake his opponent. The device is then disabled as soon as he overtakes his opponent.

Formula One teams do much research into materials. Below are list of materials used in the F1 world, what they are, what they do, where they're placed and why F1 teams choose them over everything else.

Carbon fibre is a very strong and light material that contains carbon fibres. It may sometimes contain other fibres such as Kevlar, aluminium and glass. Although it has a very big price tag, its strength to weight ratio and the good rigidity of it make it a very valuable piece of material. However as is it gets cheaper it is being used in much smaller products like sports equipment, bodies for instruments and also household objects.

Carbon fibre is most commonly used in the bodywork of an F1 car and also the air box, the wings, the engine cover, steering wheel and in the suspension. It is sometimes reinforced with titanium or steel.

It is used over every other kind of material because it’s lightweight, very strong, very stiff and can easily be moulded into any shape. 

Kevlar is another fibre like carbon. Some of its properties are very similar. Kevlar is a very strong and lightweight material. If you have an equal amount of steel and Kevlar, Kevlar would be 5 times stronger than the steel. When it is woven, it is suitable to be underwater. Kevlar is also used by the army as it is a very sturdy material and it is used to make a range of items like helmets.

Kevlar is used in pretty much the same areas as carbon fibre is used. For example it is used in the bodywork, the wings, the suspension and more.

Kevlar is an extremely firm material. As F1 cars go at high speed it adds extra protection to drivers and stops massive damage being done to the cars.

Aluminium is an element. It is very light and hard. It is often used for ships so that ship doesn’t get corroded and it is very stable due to its oxide coating. Aluminium is used in the bodywork and almost every single part of an F1 car. Aluminium is used because it is extremely light and very strong.

Magnesium is another chemical element and is very light and strong. Its main use is to combine with aluminium to make alloys which are extremely light and strong, such as magnalium. It is used mainly in the wheels and some small parts in the engines.

hydrodynamic gold foil is a type of foil which is gold coloured and stops heat from escaping. It is used between the engine and fuel tank. It is used in that certain position so it can stop heat transfer from the engine to the fuel tank.

Structural isomer

A structural isomer or constitutional isomer of a compound is another compound whose molecule has the same number of atoms of each element, but with logically distinct bonds between them. The opposite of structual isomerism is stereoisomerism. There are many words that represents structual isomers.

There are three kinds of constitutional isomers. They are skeletal isomers, positional isomers, and functional isomers. Positional isomers are also called regioisomers. Tautomers are also a kind of functional isomers.

In skeletal isomerism, or chain isomerism, components of the skeleton (usually carbon) are re-ordered to make different structures. Pentane has three isomers. They are "n"-pentane (often called simply "pentane"), isopentane (methylbutane) and neopentane (dimethylpropane).

In position isomerism, a functional group or other substituent changes its position on a parent structure. In the table below, the hydroxyl group can stay in three different positions on an n-pentane chain to make three different compounds.

Many aromatic isomers exist because substituents can be positioned on different parts of the benzene ring. Only one isomer of phenol or hydroxybenzene exists but cresol or methylphenol has three isomers where the additional methyl group can be placed on three different positions on the ring. Xylenol has one hydroxyl group and two methyl groups and 6 isomers exist.

Functional isomers are one of the structural isomers. Two compounds in functional isomerism have the same molecular formula (the number of each atom is the same, like cyclohexane: and 1-hexene:). But, the atoms are connected in other ways so that the groupings are different. We call these groups of atoms functional groups, functionalities, or moieties. Another way to say this is that two compounds that have the same molecular formula, but have different functional groups, are functional isomers.

For example, the chemical formula of cyclohexane and 1-hexene are CH. We call them functional group isomers because cyclohexane is a cycloalkane and hex-1-ene is an alkene.

For two molecules to be functional isomers, they must contain key groups of atoms arranged in particular ways. Some of the best examples come from organic chemistry. CHO is a molecular formula. Depending on how the atoms are arranged, it can represent two different compounds dimethyl ether CH-O-CH or ethanol CHCH-O-H. Dimethyl ether and ethanol are functional isomers. The first is an ether. The carbon chain-oxygen-carbon chain functionality is called an ether. The second is an alcohol. The carbon chain-oxygen-hydrogen functionality is called an alcohol.

If the functionalities stay the same, but their locations change, the structural isomers are not functional isomers. 1-Propanol and 2-propanol are structural isomers, but they are not functional isomers. Both of them are alcohols. The functional group (carbon chain-O-H) is present in both of these compounds, but they are not the same.

While some chemists use the terms structural isomer and functional isomer interchangeably, not all structural isomers are functional isomers.

Functional isomers are most often identified in chemistry using infrared spectroscopy. Infrared radiation corresponds to the energies associated primarily with molecular vibration. The alcohol functionality has a very distinct vibration called OH-stretch that is due to hydrogen bonding. All alcohols in liquid and solid form absorb infrared radiation at certain wavelengths.

Compounds with the same functional groups will all absorb certain wavelengths of infrared light because of the vibrations associated with those groups. The infrared spectrum is divided into two regions. The first part is called the functional group region. Dimethyl ether and ethanol would have different infrared spectra in the functional group region.

The second part of the infrared spectrum is called the fingerprint region; it is associated with types of motion allowed by the symmetry of the molecule and influenced by the bond energies. The fingerprint region is more specific to an individual compound. Even though 1-propanol and 2-propanol have similar infrared spectra in the functional group region, they differ in the fingerprint region.

In simple terms, functional isomers are structural isomers that have different functional groups like alcohol and ether.

As an example of isomer counting, 7 structural isomers exist with molecular formula CHO, each with different bond connectivities and air-stable at ambient temperature. An additional two structural isomers are the enol tautomers of the carbonyl isomers, but these are not stable.

Karl Pearson

Karl Pearson FRS (27 March 1857 – 27 April 1936) was an influential English mathematician. He helped establish the discipline
of mathematical statistics.
"Carl Pearson" became "Karl Pearson" by accident when he enrolled at the University of Heidelberg in 1879. They changed the spelling. He used both versions of his name until 1884 when he finally adopted Karl. Eventually he became known as "KP".

In 1911 he founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London. He was a proponent of eugenics, and a protégé and biographer of Sir Francis Galton.

A conference was held in London on 23 March 2007, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his birth.

Pearson met Charles Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, who was interested in heredity and eugenics. Pearson became Galton's protégé, at times close to hero worship.

After Galton's death in 1911, Pearson started on a massive three-volume biography of Galton. The biography was done "to satisfy myself and without regard to... the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public". It celebrated Galton's life, work, and talent. He predicted (wrongly) that Galton, rather than Charles Darwin, would be remembered as the most prodigious grandson of Erasmus Darwin.

When Galton died, he left much of his estate to University College London for a Chair in Eugenics. Pearson was the first holder of this chair, in accordance with Galton's wishes. He formed the Department of Applied Statistics, which included the Biometric and Galton laboratories. He stayed with the department until his retirement in 1933, and continued to work until his death in 1936.

Pearson's ideas helped build the statistical methods in common use today.



Yutyrannus

Yutyrannus is a Tyrannosauroid dinosaur, an early forebear of "Tyrannosaurus rex".

It lived during the Lower Cretaceous 
124.6 million years ago (mya). It was about 10 meters long and 3 meters tall, and is the largest known dinosaur with direct evidence of feathers. It is forty times heavier than the previous record holder, "Beipiaosaurus". The feathers were long, up to , and filamentous.

The fossil was found in what is now northeastern China. Three fossils of "Y. huali", were all found in the rock beds of Liaoning Province. Because of its size, it is certain that "Yutyrannus" could not fly. The feathers supported other functions, such as temperature regulation and visual signalling.

"Yutyrannus" is known from three nearly complete fossil specimens (an adult, a subadult and a juvenile). They were got from a fossil dealer who claimed all three were found in a single quarry at Batuyingzi in Liaoning Province. They were probably found in a layer of the Yixian Formation.

After the 2007 NFL Draft, he signed with the Dallas Cowboys but was released from the team on September 1.

Matt Moore first played in a regular season game on October 27th, 2007 with the Carolina Panthers after David Carr left the game with an injury. In the last game of the 2008 NFL preseason, Matt Moore was injured and did not play during the 2008 NFL season. During the 2009 NFL Season, Moore started five games and threw 8 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. At the start of the 2010 NFL season, he was the starter but after throwing 4 interceptions in the first 2 games he was replaced by Jimmy Clausen. Then he sat out for three straight games before becoming the starter again after Clausen's poor play. In week 9, he was injured and his season ended.

On July 28, 2011, the Miami Dolphins signed Moore to be Chad Henne's back up. On October 2, Henne was injured and Moore came into the game in the first quarter. He finished the game 17 of 26 for 167 passing yards and 1 interception. He started his first game with the Dolphins on October 19 against the New York Jets.

Lambeosaurinae

Lambeosaurinae is a sub-family of dinosaurs. They are hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs. Dinosaurs in Lambeosaurinae had crests on their heads. The crests had hollow tubes in them. Scientists are not sure what the crest was for. They might have been tubes that let the dinosaur breathe while it was underwater, like a snorkel. They might have helped the dinosaur make sounds.

Capri is an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is on the north side of the Gulf of Naples, Italy. The main town on the island shares the name. It has been a resort since the time of the Roman Republic. The Emperor Tiberius lived here from 26–31 AD.

Features of the island are the Belvedere of Tragara (a high panoramic promenade lined with villas), the limestone crags called sea stacks that project above the sea (the "Faraglioni"), the town of Anacapri, the Blue Grotto ("Grotta Azzurra"), and the ruins of the Imperial Roman villas.

Capri is part of the region of Campania, Province of Naples. Most people on the island live in the town of Capri. The island has two harbours, Marina Piccola and Marina Grande (the main port of the island). The separate "comune" of Anacapri is high on the hills to the west.

The etymology of the name 'Capri' is unclear.

Hypochondriasis

Hypochondriasis (more well known as hypochondria) is mental illness.
It in involves excess worries about having an illness.
This is often the result from having inaccurate perceptions of the human body or mental health.
People with hypochondria are often very worried about their health.
In fact there is nothing wrong with them.
They become unduly alarmed of even the slightest physical symptom in their very bodies.
They can become convinced they are about to become sick, have health problems, or even die.

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (c. 63 BC – 12 BC) was a general of the Roman Empire and a statesman. He was a close friend and brother-in-law of Augustus.

Agrippa's place of birth is not known for sure. It may have been the city of Arpinum. His father was callled Lucius Vipsanius Agrippa (we know this from an inscription on the Pantheon). He had an elder brother, and a sister named Vipsania Polla. The family had not been prominent in Roman public life. 

Agrippa first married Caecilia Attica, the daughter of Cicero's friend T. Pomponius Atticus. They a daughter – Vipsania Agrippina, and perhaps another: 'Vipsania Minor'. Vipsania Agrippina became the wife of Tiberius. 

By his second marriage to Claudia Marcella (oldest daughter of Octavia) he probably had a single surviving daughter. 

His third wife, Julia (daughter of Augustus) bore him three sons and two daughters: Gaius (born 20 BC), Julia the Younger, Lucius (born 17 BC), Agrippina the Elder (born ca. 15 BC), and Postumus Agrippa. The last child was born in 12 BC after the death of Agrippa. Agrippa died in March 12 BC. Agrippa's more famous descendents stem from his daughter Agrippina: they include his grandson Caligula and great-grandson Nero.

Agrippa fought in Caesar's Civil War (49–45 BC), giving help to Octavian against Lucius Antonius. 
Later services include his defeat of Sextus Pompey at Naolochus, Antony and Cleopatra at Actium, and the fall of Egypt. Later he completed of the conquest of Spain and fought in the North and East. For his valuable services he held three consulships (37, 28, 27 BC). He became Tribune of the plebs in 18 BC and renewed in 13, making him Augustus' unofficial co-emperor. He died at the height of his power in March 12 BC.

Edward Calvin Kendall

Edward Calvin Kendall (March 8, 1886, South Norwalk, Connecticut – May 4, 1972, Princeton, New Jersey) was an American chemist. 

In 1950, Kendall was awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein and Mayo Clinic physician Philip S. Hench, for their work with the hormones of the adrenal gland. His Nobel lecture was titled "The development of cortisone as a therapeutic agent". Kendall also isolated thyroxine, a hormone of the thyroid gland, and worked with the team that crystallized glutathione and identified its chemical structure.

Kendall was a biochemist at the Graduate School of the Mayo Foundation at the time of the award. He received his education at Columbia University After retiring from his job with the Mayo Foundation, Kendall joined the faculty at Princeton University, where he remained until his death in 1972.

Riccardo Drigo

Riccardo Eugenio Drigo (30 June 1846–1 October 1930) was an Italian composer of ballet music and opera, a theatrical conductor, and a pianist. Drigo is most noted for his long career as kapellmeister and Director of Music of the Mariinsky Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia. He composed music for the original works and revivals of the Mariinsky choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. Drigo also served as Chef d’orchestre for Italian opera performances of Mariinsky Theatre orchestra. During his career in St. Petersburg, Drigo conducted the premieres and regular performances of nearly every ballet and Italian opera performed on the Tsarist stage. He was considered to be one of the finest theatrical conductors in Europe.

Pierina Legnani

Pierina Legnani (1863–1930) was an Italian ballerina who introduced the 32 fouettés en tournant to the ballet world in 1893. She was born on 30 September 1863 in Milan, Italy. From 1893 until 1901, she was Prima Ballerina Assoluta at the Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg. Legnani trained at La Scala. 

Legnani danced Odette/Odile in the 1895 revised version of "Swan Lake". Her last performance was in Petipa's "La Camargo" on 28 January 1901. She retired to her villa at Lake Como. She was on the examining board of La Scala Ballet School until four months before her death. She died on 15 November 1930.


Johnny B. Goode

"Johnny B. Goode" is a song written by Chuck Berry. The single appears on Berry's 1958 album "Chuck Berry Is on Top". The song was recorded on January 6, 1958 and became the biggest hit of his career. It is played in the 1985 movie "Back to the Future".

Mathilde Kchessinska

Mathilde Marie Feliksovna Kschessinskaya (–6 December 1971 (also known as "Her Serene Highness Princess Romanova-Krasinskaya" from 1921) was a Russian ballerina from a family of Polish origin. She was known in the West as Mathilde Kschessinska or Matilda Kshesinskaya.

Her father Feliks Krzesiński and her brother both danced in St. Petersburg. She eventually attained the highest rank, that of "prima ballerina assoluta". 

Kschessinskaya was also a mistress of the future Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. She had been involved with Nicholas, from 1890, when he was a grand duke and she was just seventeen. She met him with his family after her graduation performance. They stayed lovers for three years, until Nicholas married Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt—the future Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna—in 1894, shortly after the death of his father, Tsar Alexander III.


Saikaidō Seamounts

The Saikaidō Seamounts are an underwater feature in the Philippine Sea. The seamounts are in the northern end of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR). The seabed ridge begins in an area about 900 km from the eastern end of the or ""Bungo" strait" between the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. The ridge creates a line on the ocean floor which runs southwest in the direction of the island of Palau. There is a chain of extinct volcanos on this line.

The Saikaidō underwater mountain chain is southeast of the Japanese island of Kyushu.

This seabed feature is named after "Saikaidō", which was the name given to the southern region of Japan during the Asuka period.

Each of these seamounts is a submarine extinct volcano. The undersea mountain range includes:



Totem and Taboo

Totem and Taboo is a book by Sigmund Freud. Four articles in the magazine "Imago" were combined as a book in 1914. The first article is "The Horror of Incest", the second "Taboo and Emotional Ambivalence", the third "Animism, magic, and the omnipotence of thought", and the fourth "The return of totemism in childhood". It was written partly as a response to Wilhelm Wundt's ideas on psychology, and partly as a response to Carl Jung's ideas. It describes Freud's idea of how the incest taboo began. The last article combines Charles Darwin's idea of an ancient family with William Robertson Smith's idea of human sacrifice being the origin of religious ceremonies, to argue that an ancient group of brothers killed their polygamous father and took his wives and then created totemism as an idea to create conscience and prevent their action from being repeated.


Susan Sontag

Susan Sontag (born Susan Rosenblatt, January 16, 1933 – December 28, 2004) was an American writer and political activist. Sontag was born in New York City to Jewish parents. She grew up in Tucson, Arizona and later in Los Angeles, California.

Sontag married writer Philip Rieff when she was 17. Sontag taught freshman English at the University of Connecticut for the 1952–53 academic year. 

Sontag's first book, "The Benefactor", was published in 1966. Her first film "Duett för kannibaler" was released in 1969. In 2000 she won the National Book Award.

She was openly bisexual. She married writer Philip Rieff (1922-2006) in 1950. Her only child is writer David Rieff (born 1952). The couple divorced in 1959. She was also partners with Cuban playwright María Irene Fornés.

She died of leukemia in New York City. She is buried in Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris, France.

Legally Blonde

Legally Blonde is a 2001 American comedy movie based on a novel. It stars Reese Witherspoon, Selma Blair, Luke Wilson, Matthew Davis, Victor Garber, Jennifer Coolidge and Holland Taylor, and was released on July 13, 2001. The movie got a lot of good reviews and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for and is the 29th on Bravo's 2007 list of "100 Funniest Movies". For her performance, Witherspoon was nominated for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the 2002 MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance. The movie made a lot of money at the box office, and it made almost $142 million worldwide (the budget was $18 million). The movie was later followed by two sequels and a stage play with the same name. It is set in Los Angeles, Southern California and in Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Elle Woods is a sorority sister living at the Delta Nu House at the fictional California University Los Angeles (CULA) (based on the real University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)) where she studies in "Fashion Merchandising" and has a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Elle's boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, the son of a U.S. congressman, breaks up with her the night she expects him to propose for marriage, claiming that he needs "to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn", meaning that Elle is not a serious person for a wife and for his career. Warner will go to Harvard Law School, and Elle becomes determined to be accepted to the school to win him back. Once at Harvard, Elle learns that Warner has a new fiancée, Vivian Kensington, who is a member of the same country club as Warner's family and, like most of her classmates, sees Elle as inferior. Elle is able to exonerate a sorority sister accused of murder at a trial, and tells Warner, who wants her back after her successful legal defense, that she does not need him. Elle gives the speech to the law school class at their graduation ceremony after proving herself and earning the respect of her classmates. She begins a relationship with the former Harvard Law School student and lawyer Emmett Richmond.

Alexander Gorsky

Alexander Gorsky (6 August 1871–1924) was a Russian ballet choreographer and a contemporary of Marius Petipa. He is known for restaging Petipa’s classical ballets such as "Swan Lake", "Don Quixote", and "The Nutcracker". Gorsky "sought greater naturalism, realism, and characterization" in ballet. He valued acting skills over "bravura" technique (a showy display of skills such as many turns or high jumps.) His interpretations of ballets were often controversial and he often used artists outside the dance world to create sets and costumes. Gorsky gave continuity to the plots of Petipa’s ballets and removed excessive choreography that did not relate to the story.

William Smith (geologist)

William 'Strata' Smith (23 March 1769 – 28 August 1839) was an English geologist, who created the first nationwide geological map.

Like another great scientist of his time, Michael Faraday, he was the son of a blacksmith. His geological discoveries were made when, as a young man, he was a surveyor, and so travelled the country. Smith's greatest discovery was that sedimentary rocks of a similar age held fossils of a similar type. So he could identify them when they were at the surface in different parts of the country.

Smith put together the historical geology of Britain (England and Wales) and southern Scotland into a single record. At the time his map was published he was almost unknown to the scientific community. His humble family and education meant he did not mix easily in learned society. His work was plagiarised, he was financially ruined, and he spent time in debtors' prison. It was only later in his life that Smith got recognition for what he had done.

In 1799 Smith produced the first large scale geologic map of the area around Bath, Somerset. Before, he only knew how to draw the vertical extent of the rocks, but not how to display them horizontally. Then, in the Somerset County Agricultural Society, he found a map showing the types of soil and vegetation around Bath and their geographical extent. The different types were coloured. Using this technique, Smith could draw a geological map from his observations showing the outcrops of the rocks. He took a few rock types, each with its own colour. Then he estimated the boundaries of each of the outcrops of rock, filled them in with colour and ended up with a crude geological map.

In 1801, he drew a rough sketch of what would become "The map that changed the world".

In 1815 he published the first geological map of Britain. Conventional symbols were used to mark canals, tunnels, tramways and roads, collieries, lead, copper and tin mines, together with salt and alum works. The various geological types were indicated by different colours; the maps were hand coloured. The map is remarkably similar to modern geological maps of England. He also published his "Delineation of the strata of England" in the same year. In another of his books "Strata identified by organized fossils" (London 1816–1819) he recognised that strata contained distinct fossils. These fossil assemblages could be used to match rocks between regions. This marks Smith as an important figure in the history of stratigraphy.

In 1817 he drew a remarkable geological vertical section from Snowdon to London. Unfortunately, his maps were soon copied (plagiarised) and sold for prices lower than he was asking. He went into debt and finally became bankrupt.

On 31 August 1819 Smith was released from King's Bench Prison in London, a debtor's prison. He returned to his home at 15 Buckingham Street to find a bailiff at the door and his home and property seized. Smith again worked as an travelling surveyor for years. One of his employers, Sir John Johnstone, recognised him and took steps to get him the respect he deserved. Between 1824 and 1826 he lived and worked in Scarborough. There he was responsible for the building of the Rotunda, a geological museum devoted to the Yorkshire coast. The Rotunda was re-opened as 'Rotunda – The William Smith Museum of Geology', on 9 May 2008.


Belgian

Belgian might mean:


Mukeshpuri

Mukeshpuri is the highest mountain in the Nathiagali Hills. It is high. It is in the Abbottabad District, Pakistan. Islamabad is south of Mukeshpuri.

Mukeshpuri is a Sanskrit word. It means "place of quietness". The Jhelum River can be seen from the top of the mountain.

Cybele

In Anatolian mythology, Cybele was the personification of the earth. She was the goddess of nature, fertility, mountains, and wild animals. She is often represented sitting on a throne, flanked by two lions, and wearing a mural crown. In Phrygian myth, she was born a hermaphroditic being named Agdistis, a child of Zeus and Gaia. Cybele had a shepherd consort named Attis, and a priesthood of eunuchs called the Galli. Her cult was adopted by the Greeks and later by the Romans.

Zeus let fall in his sleep seed upon the Earth, which in course of time gave birth to an androgynous being, born both male and female, whom they called Agdistis. But the gods, fearing Agdistis, cut off the male organ. The blood fertilized the soil and there grew up from it an almond-tree. A daughter of the river Sangarius picked an almond and laid it in her bosom, where the almond disappeared. She then had a child, a baby boy named Attis.

Her orgiastic cult dominated the central and north-western districts of Asia Minor, and was introduced into Greece via the island of Samothrake and the Boiotian town of Thebes. Cybele was closely associated with a number of Greek goddesses, firstly Rhea, the Greek mother of the gods (Meter Theon), but sometimes also Demeter (especially in the Samothrakian cult), Aphrodite (on Mount Ida) and Artemis (in Karia). Her main cult followers were the Galli, these were eunuch priests of a feminine nature, who celebrated her festivals with wild dancing, self-laceration, and self-scourging.


Nishinoomote, Kagoshima

The city was established on 1 October 1958.




Attis

In Anatolian mythology, Attis was the eunuch consort of the goddess Cybele. He was the son of Nana, the daughter of the river god Sangarius. Attis died after being castrated and was resurrected by Cybele. He was a god of vegetation and represented the fruits of the earth, which died in winter and grew back again in the spring. He is often shown wearing a Phrygian cap on his head. The cult of Cybele and Attis was adopted by the Greeks and later by the Romans.

Agdistis

In Anatolian, Greek and Roman mythology, Agdistis was a hermaphroditic being, and symbolized the wild and uncontrolled powers of nature. She is the personification of a mountain of the same name in Phrygia.

She was born after Zeus accidentally impregnated the earth goddess Gaia. The gods feared Agdistis because she held all the powers of creation within her body. Dionysus tricked her into castrating herself, and from then on she was known as the goddess Cybele. The blood from her severed gentials fertilized the earth, and from that spot an almond tree grew. One day the nymph Nana picked an almond from the tree, and held it against her chest, the almond vanished and she became pregnant with Attis.

Some ancient writers say Agdistis is the same as Cybele, and worshiped under that name. In many ancient inscriptions, Agdistis is clearly separate from Cybele, but in many others she is listed as an epithet of Cybele. Although primarily an Anatolian goddess, the cult of Agdistis covered a lot of territory. By 250 BC it had spread to Egypt, and later to Attica, Rhamnus around 80 BC (where there was a sanctuary of Agdistis), and later in Lesbos and Panticapeum. 

Galli

The Galli (singular: Gallus) were eunuch priests of the goddess Cybele or Agdistis. They were temple attendants sometimes wandering the streets begging for charity, and in return they told people's fortunes. The Galli wore feminine clothing and grew their hair long, wearing earrings, necklaces, and heavy make-up. At festivals to Cybele and Attis they danced around wildly to loud music and whipped themselves until they bled. The newcomers to the priesthood would voluntarily castrate themselves. 

In Rome, the head of the galli was known as the Archigallus. A number of archaeological finds depict the Archigallus wearing luxurious and extravagant costumes. The Archigallus was always a Roman citizen chosen by Rome's college of priests, and the term of service lasted for life. Along with the institution of the Archigallus came the Phrygianum sanctuary and the rite of the taurobolium, two aspects of the Cybele cult which the Archigallus had responsibility, as well as presiding over the Galli priests.

Demchok

Demchok or "New Demchok" is a small village and military encampment in the Indian-administered part of the disputed Demchok sector south of Aksai Chin, in the Ladakh district of Kashmir. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) passes along the southeast side of the village, following a wadi just upstream from the nearby Indus River. Across the wadi, less than a kilometer away, is the Chinese-administered village, called Dêmqog, in the Ngari Prefecture within Tibet. This village was on an old route linking Ladakh and Tibet, currently closed. The village lies 36.5 km east of Ukdungle.

Though the Kailash Mansarovar is 300 km away, the route there is mostly through plains and there is demand to improve and open a road linking China and Northern Pakistan through Demchok. Islamabad says that this is part of China, however India rejects this and claims the territory to be part of New Delhi's administration.

Carabiniers of Chile

The Carabiniers of Chile, () are the uniformed Chilean national police force and gendarmerie. This institution was created and founded on April 27, 1927. Their main mission is to keep the public order according with the Chilean laws. Since 2011, the institution is under the full control of the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security.

In coordination of this institution, the Investigations Police of Chile works also under the control of the Ministry of the Interior and Public Security.


Lucius Tarquinius Superbus

Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin the Proud) was the seventh and last legendary king of ancient Rome. He ruled Rome from 534–510 BC. Many of the stories about him are legends, and are based on earlier Greek and Babylonian stories.

He used force to become king. He changed the constitution of the Roman Kingdom to give himself complete power and used violence to rule. Many members of the Senate were killed and not replaced. He built large monuments, including a fortified temple. He and his family were forced to leave Rome after a revolt by the people. His son Sextus Tarquinius had raped Lucretia, a married noblewoman. Tarquinius Superbus died in Cumae.

Columbo

Columbo is one of the most popular American crime fiction television series, starring Peter Falk as Columbo. From February 20, 1968 – January 30, 2003, a total of 69 episodes were made.

The show is set in Los Angeles, California. It is done in inverted detective story format; first showing the murderer committing the crime, then Columbo entering the story without knowing who is the murderer, but ending up catching the murderer with the evidences found. Each episode featured a guest star playing the murderer.

A complete series was released on Blu-ray Only in Japan.


Investigations Police of Chile

The Investigations Police of Chile (, or PDI) is the civil police of Chile. It was founded on 1933. The PDI is one of two Chilean police bodies along with Carabiniers de Chile. In their functions, this institution is the first collaborator of the Public Ministry of Chile in terms of criminalistic Investigations.


Chilean Gendarmerie

The Chilean Gendarmerie, (, abbreviated to "GENCHI") is the title of Chile's uniformed national prison service. The service evolved out of Chilean Army units which were given police and prison duties. It is an armed service responsible to the Ministry of Justice. In the actuality, the service is currently led by the General Director of the Gendarmerie Mr. Luis Masferrer Farías, a lawyer appointed to this role by the Chilean president in 2010.

Gokishichidō

The Gokishichidō counted the five provinces in the or capital area as one region. In addition, there were seven in an organizational system which was imported from China in the 7th century. Each of the "circuits" or "do" was a region which had several provinces within it.

Over centuries, the government functions of the Gokishichido became less important. However, the traditional remained cultural markers.

Under the Gokishichido system, the central provinces were considered to be a core region. These lands are called the Kansai region or Kinki or Kinai. The five provinces included:

Under the Gokishichido system, there were seven roads which connected the imperial capital with all of the provincial capitals. The land around each of the roads was called by the same name as the road, including


Good Morning America

Good Morning America is an American breakfast television program hosted through the American Broadcasting Company. The show began on November 3, 1975 and airs between 7am and 9am over all Time Zones in the United States and Canada, and one hour on weekends (beginning in 2004). The show is about news, talk, weather and special interest subjects. "GMA" is produced through ABC News and broadcasted across the Times Square area of New York City.

The show is currently hosted by George Stephanopoulos, Robin Roberts, Michael Strahan, Keke Palmer and Lara Spencer. Amy Robach reads the news while Ginger Zee does the weather. Earlier hosts include Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson.

Biological species concept

The biological species concept gives an explanation of how species form (speciation). A biological species is a group of individuals that can breed together (panmixia). However, they cannot breed with other groups. In other words, the group is reproductively isolated from other groups.

According to Ernst Mayr, a new species forms when an existing species splits. A similar idea had been suggested in the 19th century by Moritz Wagner. Dobzhansky described the role of reproductive isolation in the formation of new species. Once a species lives in two different areas, the geographical isolation makes breeding between the groups reduce or stop. Each group develops features which make breeding between them work less well. Eventually, each group becomes a 'good' biological species, because the two species do not reproduce with each other even when they are together.

This is still considered the most common reason for species splitting, and has the technical name of allopatric speciation. It is contrasted with sympatric speciation where speciation takes place even though all the members live in the same area.

The biological species is the main reason for classifying living things, but applying it in practice is not easy. Good examples of this are the following:

What this is saying is that, in practice, the biological species concept is not sufficient by itself to decide on the classification of animals.

In 1686 John Ray introduced a non-evolutionary biological concept. To him, species were distinguished by always producing the same species, and this was fixed and permanent, though considerable variation was possible within a species.

The idea of a species as a physical type of organism had a long history. This survives as the concept of a type specimen in taxonomy. It was the way Linnaeus worked in his binomial classification, and is still useful for amateur naturalists today.

In the "Origin", Charles Darwin said that species were labels which experts gave on the basis of their observations.

But twenty years before, he had a much better idea. He thought of species as maintained by reproductive isolation. He even says "Hence species may be good ones and differ scarcely at all in any external character". Here he quotes the two sibling species of leaf warbler discovered in England by Gilbert White in 1768. At this early stage in his career, Darwin came very close to the modern biological species concept.

In the last 70 years two ideas have dominated the way professional biologists think about species.

The first is the population genetics concept. This is where a species is seen as a group which can mate together even though they are all to some extent different. It amounts to saying that a species is a gene pool.

The second is the use of DNA sequence analysis to show whether similar-looking species are genetically different from each other. This is especially useful when it is not practical to do breeding experiments.

Sibling species are often called cryptic (hidden) species because their differences can only be seen by analysing their DNA. They are very common in the marine environment.

Many cryptic species exist in all habitats. In the marine bryozoan "Celleporella hyalina", DNA sequence analysis was used to show that more than ten ecologically distinct species that had been diverging for many millions of years.

Evidence from the identification of cryptic species means that older estimates of global species richness are too low. For example, mitochondrial DNA research suggests there are at least 11 genetically distinct populations of giraffes. Similarly, the Amazonian frog "Eleutherodactylus ockendeni" is at least three different species which diverged over 5 million years ago.

Kyushu-Palau Ridge

Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR) is an ocean floor feature in the Philippine Sea. It is named after the nearby islands. At the northern end is the Japanese island of Kyushu. At the southern end is the Pacific island nation of Palau.

The seabed ridge begins in an area about 900 km from the eastern end of the or ""Bungo" strait" between the Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. The ridge creates a line on the ocean floor which runs southeast in the direction of the island of Palau. There is a chain of extinct volcanos on this line.

KPR is southeast of the Japanese island of Kyushu.

KPR was created by movement at the northern edges of the Philippine Plate.



Seamount

A seamount is a mountain rising from the ocean sea floor. It does not reach to the water's surface (sea level), and so is not an island. These are usually formed from submarine volcanoes. They are usually 1,000–4,000 metres (3,000–13,000 ft) in height from the sea floor. 

The peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of metres below the surface, and so are in the deep sea. There are an estimated 100,000 seamounts around the globe, but only a few have been studied. Seamounts come in all shapes and sizes, and follow a distinctive pattern of growth, activity, and death. In recent years, several active seamounts have been observed, for example Loihi seamount in the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain.

Over time, the largest seamounts may reach the sea surface. There wave action erodes the summit to form a flat surface. After they have subsided and sunk below the sea surface such flat-top seamounts are called "guyots" or "tablemounts".

Seamounts are one of the most common oceanic ecosystems in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents attract plankton, corals, fish, and cetacea alike. Their effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are concerns about the effect of fishing on seamount ecosystems. There are well-documented cases of stock decline. 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which literally scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.

Most seamounts are not yet to be studied, or even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies used to collect data. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts. The Muirfield seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses. As they get older, water eats away at their sides. This causes landslides which, in turn, may cause massive tsunamis.



Hazelnut

Hazelnuts are nuts of the hazel genus of tree; they are also called cob nuts and filbert nuts. Filbert nuts are more elongated (twice as long as they are round). These nuts fall from their husks when ripe (that is, seven to eight months past pollination). Hazelnuts are oftentimes used as livestock feed or ground into paste. Hazelnut is produced especially in Greece, Turkey, Italy and the U.S. states Washington and Oregon. Hazelnuts are also used alongside chocolate for chocolate truffles. Moreover, hazelnut are rich in proteins and unsaturated fats.

Hazelnuts can also be used to make hazelnut butter.

Sibling species

Sibling species are species which look alike, but cannot breed with each other.

The classic case is "Drosophila pseudoobscura" and "D. persimilis". They are almost identical, but if flies from one species are put with flies from the other species, they do not interbreed. Another example was the European mosquito known as "Anopheles maculipennis". This turned out to be a cluster of six different species, some of which transmit malaria, and some do not.

Planning

Planning is the way most organizations work to do big projects. It is thinking about what needs to happen, and then making a detailed plan. It may include a schedule.

All humans plan to some extent: it is a fundamental property of intelligent behaviour. In big organisations and government planning is a main activity. It combines forecasting developments with scenarios of how to react to them.

Forecasting is predicting what the future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the future "should" look like.

The "nuts and bolts" of planning are the documents, diagrams, and meetings, the objectives and the strategy to be followed. Beyond this, planning has a different meaning depending on the context in which it is used.

The counterpart to planning is self-organization, when order emerges spontaneously out of seeming chaos.

John Hickenlooper

John Wright Hickenlooper (born February 7, 1952) is an American politician. He is the junior United States Senator from Colorado since 2021. He was the 42nd Governor of Colorado from January 11, 2011 to January 8, 2019. Hickenlooper is a Democrat. He was the mayor of Denver, Colorado from 2003 to 2011.

Hickenlooper announced his candidacy for President of the United States on March 4, 2019. He ended his campaign on August 15, 2019. A few days later, he announced his candidacy for the United States Senate challenging incumbent Senator Cory Gardner. In June 2020, he won the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate race. In November 2020, he won the election. At 68, Hickenlooper became the oldest first-term senator to represent Colorado and the only Quaker member of Congress.

Hickenlooper was born in Narberth, Pennsylvania. He was raised by his mother after his father died young. He is a graduate of Wesleyan University. At Wesleyan, he earned a B.A. in English in 1974 and a master’s degree in geology in 1980.

Before becoming mayor in July 2003, he was a geologist and then a businessperson. Hickenlooper owned several restaurants in the late 1980s. He was one of the founders of the original Wynkoop Brewing Company brewpub.

Hickenlooper has wanted more homeless services since becoming mayor in 2003. He talked about his "10 year plan to end homelessness" at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C..

In 2006, Denver became the first major American city to make legal the private use of marijuana by people over age 21. Hickenlooper was against the marijuana legalization initiative. When the voters approved it 53.49%-46.51%, he said that the vote "reflect[s] a genuine shift in people's attitudes." Currently the Denver Police say the initiative does not overrule the state law, the Colorado Revised Statutes (CRS). Hickenlooper agrees with the Denver Police. The CRS currently treats marijuana possession much like driving faster than the speed limit. The penalty is fines of up to $100 and no jail time.

Hickenlooper formally announced his candidacy for President of the United States on March 4, 2019. He released a campaign video titled “Standing Tall”. Before announcing his campaign, Hickenlooper was widely seen as a possible candidate for President in 2020. Hickenlooper formally launched his campaign on March 7, 2019 in Denver.

In a poll for potential Democratic candidates for the Colorado Senate, Hickenlooper was the front-runner with 61%. On August 22, 2019, Hickenlooper announced his candidacy for the Senate. In June 2020, he won the Democratic nomination. On November 3, 2020, Hickenlooper was declared the winner of the Senate race. 

Hickenlooper's ex-wife, Helen Thorpe, is a writer. Her work has been published in "The New Yorker", "New York Times Magazine", "George", and "Texas Monthly". They lived in Denver's Park Hill neighborhood with their son, Teddy. Hickenlooper told the "Philadelphia Inquirer" that he and Thorpe attend Quaker meetings and try to live by Quaker values.

Gradualism

Gradualism is a process of change by gradual, slow stages. In politics, it is the opposite of revolutions and rapid change. "Gradualism is... sometimes associated with social democracy."

In geology, it is in tune with uniformitarianism and against catastrophism. In biology it is in tune with Darwinian ideas of slowly changing species as opposed to large rapid changes

Gradualism is one of the defining features of political liberalism and reformism. It is against abrupt strokes such as revolutions or uprisings. Instead, change ought to be brought about in small discrete steps.

Martin Luther King, Jr., was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating racial segregation. The government wanted to try to integrate African-Americans and European-Americans slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:

This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.— Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, delivered August 28, 1963 at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC

Charles Lindblom was an influential professor and author who believed in muddling through ("incrementalism") as the right way to go. He pointed out the connexions between the political system, the market-place and democratic freedom.

In the natural sciences, gradualism is a theory that profound change is the product of slow but continuous processes. It is often contrasted with catastrophism. Gradualism was proposed in 1795 by James Hutton to explain geology, and was later was the basis for Charles Lyell's "Principles of Geology". William Whewell called the idea 'uniformitarianism'. It formed the basis of early evolutionary theory.

Charles Darwin was influenced by Lyell's "Principles of Geology". Everything we see from the past is explained by processes we can see going on today. The present is key to the past. So Darwin thought evolutionary must occur gradually, not in jumps ('saltations'), since we do not see big changes going on today. Extreme and rapid changes in an organism would be most likely to be fatal. It is almost universally agreed that complex organs such as the eye must have evolved by many small steps rather than by one or two mutations.

"Phyletic gradualism" is a term coined by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge to contrast with their model of punctuated equilibrium. They proposed that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability or stasis, punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution. Their idea is less accepted today.

The geography and administrative subdivisions of Japan have evolved and changed during the course of its history. Since the late-7th century, the regions of Japan have been grouped according to geographic position.

In the Meiji period, the modern regional system was made by Imperial decree. Japan was divided into regions ("chihō "). A regional council ("chihō gyōsei kyōgisai") was headed by the governor of the most powerful prefecture in the regional grouping. The council also included regional chiefs of central government ministries.
In this time, political development is marked by persistent loyalty to region and locality.

The Kansai region is used as a basic framework for description and comparison.

Since the late-7th century, the "Kinai" region, also known as "Go-Kinai", included the "Five Home Provinces" which surrounded the old capital city of Kyoto. In 645, "Kinai" was created as part of the Taika Reform. These lands are also called the Kansai region or Kinki.

The Kantō region is used as a basic framework for description and comparison.

Since the late-7th century, the "Tōkaidō" region or "Eastern Sea Circuit" was made up of 15 provinces on the Pacific Ocean from Sendai Bay to "Kinai". Fuji-san, Tokyo, Yokohama, and other important or well-known places are in this region. "Tōkaidō" also names a road which connects the provincial capitals of this region on the island of Honshū.

The Tōhoku region is used as a basic framework for description and comparison.

Since the late-7th century, the "Tōsandō" region or "Eastern Mountain Circuit" was made up of 13 provinces. "Tōsandō" also names a road which connects the provincial capitals of this region on the island of Honshū. "Tōsandō" included Musashi Province after 711.

The Chūbu region is used as a basic framework for description and comparison.

Since the late-7th century, the "Hokurikudō" region or the "Northern-land Circuit" was made up of 7 provinces on the Sea of Japan. "Hokurikudō" also names a road which connects the provincial capitals of this region on the island of Honshū.

The Chūgoku region is used as a basic framework for description and comparison.

Since the late-7th century, the "San'indō" region or "Mountain-shade Circuit" was made up of 8 provinces on the Sea of Japan. "San'indō" also names a road which connects the provincial capitals of this region on the island of Honshū.

Since the late-7th century, the "San'yōdō" region or "Mountain-sun Circuit" was made up of provinces on south or 'sunny' side of the mountains. "San'indō" also names a road which connects the 8 provincial capitals of this region on the island of Honshū.

The Shikoku region is used as a basic framework for description and comparison.

Since the late-7th century, the "Nankaidō" region or the "South-sea Circuit" made up of 6 provinces (the island of Awaji, the 4 provinces of Shikoku, and Kishiu on Honshū). "Nankaidō" also names a road which connects the provincial capitals of this region.

The Kyūshū region is used as a basic framework for description and comparison.

Since the late-7th century, the "Saikaidō" region or the "West-sea Circuit" was made up of the 9 provinces of the Kyūshū region. "Saikaidō" also names a road which connected the provincial capitals of this region.

After 1878, the region included the Ryukyu Islands.

The Hokkaidō region is used as a basic framework for description and comparison.

In the late 19th-century, the "Hokkaidō" region or "North Sea Circuit" was made up of the 10 provinces of Yezo. The Kurile Islands became an 11th northern province which was added in 1875.



Hokurikudō

"Hokurikudō" was one of the main circuits of the Gokishichidō system. It was first established during the Asuka period. Over centuries, the government functions of the "Gokishichido" became less important. However, the traditional eight regions, including "Hokurikudō", remained cultural markers.

The "Hokurikudō" road connected the capitals of the provinces in this region.

When the Gokishichidō system was initially established after the Taika reforms, the region consisted of just two provinces: Wakasa and Koshi. During the reign of Emperor Temmu, Koshi was divided into three provinces: Echizen, Etchū and Echigo and Sado Island was added as a fifth province. Later, Noto and Kaga were carved out of Echizen.

"Hokurikudō" has parts of seven ancient provinces.

Vigevano

Vigevano (Avgevan in the local variety of Western Lombard) is a city and "comune" (township) in the province of Pavia, Lombardy, northern Italy, which has many treasures and a huge industrial business. It is in the middle of a district called Lomellina, a great rice-growing centre. Vigevano received the honorary title of city with a declaration of Duke Francis II Sforza on February 2, 1532. Vigevano is well known for its beautiful Renaissance ""Piazza Ducale"", in the middle of the town.

Vigevano dates back to the 10th century AD, when it was one of Lombard king Arduin's favourite places because of the good hunting.

Vigevano was a Ghibelline township, favoring the Emperor and was therefore invaded and taken by the Milanese in 1201 and again in 1275. In 1328 it finally gave itself up to Azzone Visconti, after which it shared the fortunes of Milan. The Church of S. Pietro Martire (St. Peter Martyr) was built, with the neighbouring Dominican convent, by Filippo Maria Visconti in 1445. In the last years of Visconti's control it kept a siege by Francesco Sforza. Once he was settled in power in Lombardy, Sforza made Vigevano the seat of a bishop and provided its revenues.

Vigevano is crowned by the Castello Sforzesco, a stronghold rebuilt 1492–94 for Ludovico Maria Sforza (Ludovico il Moro), the great patron born in the town, who changed the fortification/hunting lodge of Luchino Visconti (who in turn had re-used a Lombard fortress) into a rich noble residence, at the cusp of Gothic and Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci was his guest at Vigevano, as was Bramante, who is credited with the tall tower that watches over the piazza from the Castello Sforzesco. The old castle has a unique raised covered road, high enough for horsemen to ride through, that travels between the new palace and the old fortifications; there is a Falconry, an elegant loggiato supported by 48 columns, and, in the rear area of the mastio, the Ladies' Loggia made for Duchess Beatrice d'Este.

LGBT rights in the Republic of China

The Republic of China (Taiwan) is one of Asia's most tolerant countries as far as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) rights are concerned. The government proposed a bill in 2003 to make same-sex marriage legal. It has so far stalled without passage. If the law passes, the ROC would be the first country in Asia to allow same-sex marriages. In 2017, the ROC's Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex marriage should become legal within two years. The ROC is also described as the most liberal after over 30,000 people went to the Taiwan Pride parade in 2010 and 2011, making it the largest LGBT event in Asia. On May 17, 2019, the Legislative Yuan approved a bill, submitted by the Executive Yuan, recognising marriage for same-sex couples. The bill was signed into law by President Tsai Ing-wen on 22 May and went into effect on 24 May. Taiwan therefore became the first country in Asia to recognise same-sex marriage.

Competition (economics)

In economics, the word competition means that there are at least two competitors (¨players¨) who want to get a share of a market. The market is divided between all the economic players; this means that if a player gets a higher market share, another player will get a smaller share of the market. In his work, The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith says that all players uses the resources they have so that they will get the most profit from these resources. According to Smith, this encourages efficiency. 
Game theory looks at competition, from a mathematical point of view.


Note that competition does not necessarily involve different companies; in the 1920s, General Motors had divisions that overlapped, and that competed for resources. Procter & Gamble introduced the competition between different brands in the 1930s.

Also note that competition is limited: In some areas, there are monopolies, often granted by the state. The state may also apply taxes or pay subsidies as a way to protect its own economy.

Other factors that limit competition include the existence of cartels.

Hotel Mario

Hotel Mario is a puzzle game developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media and Nintendo for the CD-i in 1994. The primary character of the game is Mario, who must find Princess Toadstool by going through seven Koopa hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into many levels, and what the player must do is close all doors on each level. Killing a Koopaling on the hotel's final level takes the player to the next building. After Nintendo decided not to have Philips create an add-on for the Super NES, they gave Philips permission to use five of their characters in games for Philips' CD-i. There wasn't a lot of time for the games to be developed and there was little funding. The games resulting from the license were widely criticized, with "Hotel Mario" being known as one of the worst "Mario"-centered games, due to the animation of the shutting doors, the non-working controls and especially known for the cutscenes that used full motion video. The CD-i was considered a commercial failure and the games became valuable because of their rarity.

The player controls Mario or his brother Luigi in two-player mode. The player has to complete all levels of the seven hotels in the game. The first six hotels contain 10 levels, and the last 2 hotels contains 15 levels. The player to shut every door before time runs out to get to the next level. The game does not show how to shut the doors. Elevators, which work differently depending on the hotel, let the player to go between the five floors of the level. The amount of points the player gets in the game will depend on how fast they can beat the level. Every stage has its own title screen, which is how the game can be saved. The screens are also used to enter hotel levels that were already played and the map of the Mushroom Kingdom, which allows the player to access any visited hotel.

While trying to close the doors, the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if he touches an enemy, runs out of time, runs off the edge of the floor he is on, or if all the doors are open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular "Mario" series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos, and their variations. The opponent on the last level of each hotel is one of the Koopalings, who use different methods to try to kill Mario.

In his normal state, Mario can take one hit from an enemy and kill most of the monsters with a stomp. By opening doors, the player can find power-ups, which grant different powers. A Super Mushroom transforms Mario into Super Mario, making Mario glow and have the strength to take two enemy hits. If the player finds another mushroom while Mario is in the Super Mario form, the item turns into a Fire Flower. When grabbing it, Mario becomes Fire Mario and can throw fireballs to kill enemies. A 1-up mushroom known as "Extra Mario Mushroom" or "Toad" can only be found by Fire Mario. Another way to earn an extra life is collecting 30 coins. The player can also get a Star Man, which makes Mario temporarily able to knock any enemy off the screen by simply touching them.
Bowser has turned the Mushroom Kingdom into a hotel resort for the use of himself and his children. The land is renamed "Klub Koopa Resort" because of this. Each hotel in the area is protected by one of the Koopalings and their henchmen. The hotels represent different building types with many different locations, including a tree, a mine and a cloud. When Mario and Luigi are invited to a picnic by Princess Toadstool, Mario and Luigi enter the Mushroom Kingdom. At the entrance, however, they find a message from Bowser. They find out that Bowser has taken control over the kingdom and established seven hotels there, at one of which Princess Toadstool is being held as a "permanent guest". As they visit the first six hotels, Mario and Luigi find the Princess many times, but on every occasion she disappears out of their sight, ending up in another hotel. They eventually enter another land where Bowser himself lives. With the hotel's owner killed, the brothers run away from the building with Princess Toadstool before it falls apart. The Princess, now able to rule her kingdom in peace, thanks the Mario brothers for saving her, giving them both a kiss.

In May 1991, after failing to develop a CD-ROM-based add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with Sony, Nintendo signed a deal with Philips to develop the add-on. However, after seeing the negative reviews of the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo no longer considered the add-on profitable anymore, and the project was stopped entirely. As part of dissolving the deal, Nintendo gave Philips the license to use five of their characters, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool, to be featured in their games for the CD-i. Philips used the characters to create games for the CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give comments on the look of the characters. The "Mario" characters were going to be used in "Super Mario's Wacky Worlds", but the game was cancelled with only some prototype versions being programmed. While "Wacky Worlds" was planned as a CD-i adaptation of the side-scrolling platformer video game "Super Mario World", "Hotel Mario" was made into a puzzle game in which level areas were limited to a single screen. Unlike the "Legend of Zelda"-related games also for the CD-i, the game was not developed by a third-party company, but by Philips' development team Fantasy Factory.

Many full motion video cutscenes were animated for "Hotel Mario". The videos show Mario and Luigi as they get to the next hotel, telling each other and giving hints to the player such as: "If you need instructions on how to get through the hotels, check out the enclosed instruction book!". The voices of the Mario Brothers were provided by Marc Graue, with Jocelyn Benford doing the voice-over for Princess Toadstool. On top of the full motion video capabilities of the CD-i, "Hotel Mario" made use of the system’s internal clock by showing messages that changed according to the date.

The backgrounds of the hotel stages were designed by freelance artist Trici Venola. After seeing "Hotel Mario"'s first version—which Venola called "mechanical" and "visually no fun"—she and art director Jeff Zoern decided to use elements from Disney and J. R. R. Tolkien to improve the game's visual style. Drawings of the stages were made out of several blocks, each of which featured one detail. The first item Venola created for all hotels was the door. Every building took one week to complete and was designed according to a specific theme. For example, a gothic design was used for Bowser's hotel.

Upon its release, "Hotel Mario" received negative reviews from video game magazines "Electronic Gaming Monthly" and "GamePro". Critics commented that "Hotel Mario"s gameplay was simple yet addicting. "GamePro", while calling the game fun, believed that it would soon bore players, and gave it a fun factor of 2.5 out of 5. When "Electronic Gaming Monthly" named Mario the greatest video game character in 2005, they considered "Hotel Mario" his most embarrassing moment. Similarly, it was considered as the worst Mario game of all time by ScrewAttack, who criticized the game for its audio and controls, as well as for being solely "based on shutting doors." GameDaily included "Hotel Mario" in its list of the worst games starring Nintendo mascots, stating its gameplay lacked identifiable Mario elements mainly used in the series. The game was also listed as the worst 2D platformer in the "Mario" series by N-Europe. The site found the Koopaling battles "uniquely bad", calling the game itself a "steaming turd".

IGN said that "Hotel Mario" was better than "The Legend of Zelda" titles, but noted that closing doors was not "a strong enough hook for an entire game." Chris Kohler of "Wired" magazine saw "Hotel Mario" as "a puzzle game with no puzzles", assuming it was one of the reasons why Nintendo was not impressed by the CD-ROM medium. The game was referred to as "craptastic" by GamesRadar and "little more than a really rubbish version of "Elevator Action"" by Eurogamer.

In its 1994 review, "GamePro" rated "Hotel Mario"'s graphics at 3.5 and sound at 4 out of 5, saying that "the only intriguing aspects of this game are the well-fashioned animated sequences." Years after the game was released, the cut scenes were also criticized among video game websites, and were called "outright terrifying" by 1UP.com. IGN described them as "abysmal" and "a bad flip-book of images printed out of Microsoft Paint. The quality of the voice acting was also questioned. Both 1UP.com and IGN thought the voices were unfitting for the characters and did not achieve the same playfulness as those of Mario and Luigi's current voice artist Charles Martinet. "Hotel Mario" was listed in the Top 20 Worst Mario Games of all time.

Greater flamingo

The greater flamingo ("Phoenicopterus roseus") is the most widespread species of the flamingo family. It is found in the wetlands areas of Africa, southwest Europe, and South Asia. This is the largest species of flamingo, averaging up to 5 feet tall, and weighing 8 lbs. Their wingspan is 4 to 6 feet. Greater flamingos live up to 20 years in the wild. Their diet consists of seeds, algae, and small invertebrates.

The bird lives in mudflats and shallow coastal lagoons with salt water. Using its feet, the bird stirs up the mud, then sucks water through its bill and filters out small shrimp, seeds, blue-green algae, microscopic organisms and molluscs. The greater flamingo feeds with its head down. Its upper jaw is movable and not rigidly fixed to its skull. It was the state bird of Junagadh State.

Bar-headed goose

The bar-headed goose ("Anser indicus") is a type of goose that lives in wetland areas in Central Asia. It has a light grey body, broad wings, and a white face and neck. Its name comes from the two stripes (or "bars") of dark feathers that wrap around the back of its head. Like other geese, its feet are webbed. They can get up to 2.5 feet long and weigh 6.5 pounds. They eat mainly grass, wheat, barley and rice.

The main physiological challenge of bar-headed geese is getting oxygen from thin air to their aerobic muscle fibres so they can fly at high altitudes. Flight is very metabolically costly at high-altitudes because birds need to flap harder in thin air to generate lift. 

Studies have found that bar-headed geese breathe more deeply and efficiently under low oxygen conditions, which serves to increase oxygen uptake from the environment. The haemoglobin of their blood has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to low-altitude geese.

Bar-headed geese have a slightly larger wing area for their weight than other geese, which is believed to help them fly at high altitudes. Birds at high-altitude still need to flap harder than lowland birds.

All this is relevant, since they fly through the high passes in the Himalayas when they migrate to & from the Indian subcontinent.

Müller's Bornean gibbon

The Müller's Bornean gibbon ("Hylobates muelleri"), also known as the grey gibbon, is a primate in the Hylobatidae family. The Muller's gibbon ranks among the smallest gibbons, weighing . It is about tall. The grey gibbons can live more than 40 years in captivity. They eat primarily fruit, leaves, flowers, and invertebrates.

Muller's gibbons can only be found in the tropical rainforest of the island Borneo.

Grey bamboo lemurs grow up to long and weigh up to . The eastern lesser bamboo lemur has a dense, woolly coat that is grey to olive-grey on the upperparts, with chestnut-brown tinges on the head, shoulders, and sometimes the back.

Angola colobus

The Angola colobus ("Colobus angolensis") is an arboreal monkey that belongs to the "Colobus" genus. They have no thumbs, which is not normal among primates. This allows them to shape their fingers into a winging hook. They eat leaves, fruit, and seeds.

Angolan colobus monkeys have glossy, black fur covers much of the body, but contrasts with short, white hair surrounding the face, a u-shaped, cape-like mantle of long white hair that extends down the shoulders and across the lower back, and a bushy white tuft to the tip of the tail. Colobus monkeys typically can weigh 2 lbs and grow over 2 feet long. Their lifespan is 20 to 30 years in the wild.

Colobus monkeys live in the trees of the African savannah and tropical forests.

Bother (song)

"Bother" is the second single from the alternative metal band Stone Sour's first album "Stone Sour". It was originally released as a solo song by frontman Corey Taylor, but the billing was later changed to Stone Sour. The song was one of Stone Sour's first songs to put them into the mainstream. The cover features Taylor's hands and rings, one of them being a Spider-Man ring which is a reference to the song being featured on the soundtrack to the film "Spider-Man" (although the track is credited to Taylor as the performer not Stone Sour) and to Taylor being a fan of Spider-Man. The other has the number 8 on it, representing Taylor's number in Slipknot. Taylor has stated that the song is about when he moved back to Des Moines from Denver, where he hoped to try to move forward with his music.

Croup

Croup (or laryngotracheobronchitis) is a disease caused by a virus and leads to swelling inside the throat. This swelling causes problems with normal breathing. People with croup can have a "barking"cough, stridor (a high-pitched wheezing sound), and hoarseness. Croup often gets worse at night. Taking steroids by mouth can treat the condition. Sometimes epinephrine is used in more severe cases. Hospitalization is rarely required.

Doctors decide if a person has croup after they have eliminated other possibilities (for example, something in the throat). Blood tests, X-rays, and cultures are not needed. Croup is common. About 15% of children between 6 months and 5–6 years old get croup. Teenagers and adults rarely get croup.

The "barking" cough can sound like a seal or sea lion. Crying can make the wheezing worse; wheezing can mean that the airways are narrowed. As croup gets worse, the wheezing can be less. Other symptoms are fever, symptoms typical of the common cold, and the skin between the ribs pulling in when the child breathes. Drooling or a sick appearance can mean a different illness. The virus infection leads to swelling in the throat and air passages that make breathing difficult.

Most croup is caused by a virus infection. Some people call severe laryngotracheitis croup. This disease is caused by a milder virus. 

In 75% of cases, the parainfluenza virus, mainly types 1 and 2, causes croup. Other viruses that can cause croup include influenza A and B, measles, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus . Spasmodic croup (croup with barking) does not have the usual signs of infection, such as fever, sore throat, and increased white blood cell count). Treating spasmodic croup is the same as treating regular croup.

Bacterial croup includes laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. "Corynebacterium diphtheriae" causes laryngeal diphtheria; bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis come from a virus infection, followed by a bacteria infection. The most common bacteria that cause croup are"Staphylococcus aureus", "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "Hemophilus influenzae", and "Moraxella catarrhalis". These diseases caused by bacteria are more severe

Croup is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The first step is to make sure it is not another condition that can block the upper airway, especially epiglottitis (an inflammation of the tissue that covers the trachea or windpipe) , something in the airway, subglottic stenosis (narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords), angioedema (swelling underneath the skin), retropharyngeal abscess (pus in the back of the throat), and bacterial tracheitis (bacterial infection in the trachea).

An X-ray of the neck is not routine, but if it is done, it can show a narrowing of the trachea, called the steeple sign, because the narrow shape looks like a church steeple. The steeple sign does not appear in half of cases.

Blood tests and viral cultures (tests for the virus) can irritate the airway. Cultures of the virus, obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration (using a tube to suck mucus out of the nose), are used to confirm the exact cause. These cultures are used by people doing research. If a person does not improve with standard treatment, further tests can be done to check for bacteria.

Severity

The most common system for describing the severity of croup is the Westley score. This test is used for research, but does not help the person with croup. Points are given for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis (blue skin coloring), stridor (wheezing), air entry, and skin on the chest pulling in. The table lists the points given for each factor; the final score ranges from 0 to 17.


85% of children going to the emergency department have mild disease. Severe croup is rare–less than 1% of cases.

Immunization (vaccines) for influenza and diphtheria can prevent croup.

It is important to keep children with croup as calm as possible. Children often are given steroids, but epinephrine is used in severe cases. If the blood oxygen is under 92%, the child needs oxygen. People with severe croup can be hospitalized for observation. If oxygen is needed, "blow-by" administration (holding an oxygen source near the face of the child) is better than an oxygen mask, because it is less likely to upset a child than an oxygen mask. With treatment, less than 0.2% of people need endotracheal intubation (a tube placed into the airway).

Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and budesonide, can be used to treat croup. People begin to improve a lot within six hours after taking steroids. Steroids work when given by mouth, injection, or breathing them in, but taking them by mouth is best. Most of the time, a single dose is enough. Dexamethasone at doses of 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg appear to be all equally good.

Moderate to severe croup can be helped with nebulized epinephrine(an inhaled solution that widens the airway). While epinephrine reduces croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours. If symptoms improve for 2–4 hours after treatment and no other complications happen, the child typically can leave the hospital.

There is not enough evidence that other treatments for croup are helpful. Clinical studies do not show that breathing hot steam or humidified air is helpful and it rarely is used. Medical professionals do not want people to use cough medicines, which containdextromethorphan and/or guiafenesin. Clinical studies also do not support inhaling heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) to make it easier to breath. Since most cases of croup are viral diseases, antibiotics are not used unless bacteria are also suspected. The antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended for bacterial infections. In severe cases associated with influenza A or B, the anti neuraminidase inhibitors can be given.

Croup caused by a virus is usually a short-term disease. Croup rarely causes death from respiratory failure and/or cardiac arrest. Symptoms improve within two days, but can last for up to seven days. Uncommon complications include bacterial tracheitis (infection of the trachea), pneumonia (lung infection), and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs).

About 15% of children between the ages of 6 months and 5–6 years will get croup. Croup accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions for this age group. In rare cases, children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years have croup. Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females. Croup is more common in autumn.

The word "croup" comes from the Early Modern English verb "croup," meaning "to cry hoarsely". The name was first used for the disease in Scotland. Diphtheritic croup has been known since the time of Homer's Ancient Greece. In 1826, Bretonneau distinguished croup from a virus and croup due to diphtheria. The French called croup from a virus "faux-croup," using "croup" for a disease caused by the diphtheria bacteria. Croup due to diphtheria is now nearly unknown since most people are immunized.

San'indō

"San'indō" was one of the main circuits of the "Gokishichidō" system. It was first established during the Asuka period. Over centuries, the government functions of the "Gokishichido" became less important. However, the traditional eight regions, including "San'indō", remained cultural markers.

"San'indō" is the northern part of southern Honshū. The region is on the Sea of Japan. It is a geographic region which has eight ancient provinces, including

The lands of three prefectures is in the region of "San'indō": Kyoto, Hyōgo and Tottori.

Today, Route 9, the San'in Expressway, and the San'in Main Line of the West Japan Railway Company follow the approximate route of the San'indō.

Otitis

Otitis means inflammation or infection of the ear. It can happen in both humans and other animals. It can affect different parts of the ear:

Symptons include ear wax, ear-ache and headaches. It often affects sinuses and throat also.

Scientists have found signs of ear infections in the bones of humans who lived 15,000 years ago.

Synovial fluid

Synovial fluid is viscous non-Newtonian fluid within the cavities of synovial joints. Synovial means "yolk like". The principal role for synovial fluid is to reduce friction between the articular cartilage of the joints during movement.

Cracking joints

Cracking joints consist of the action of moving joints to the point of producing popping or cracking sounds. This commonly occurs during deliberate knuckle cracking. This usually happens in the fingers. However, it can also happen in hips, wrists, elbows, ankles, knees and toes, particularly if they are moved into unusual positions. Cracking or popping usually happens due to cavitation within the joints, in particular cavitation related to synovial fluid.

Premier of South Australia

The premier of South Australia is the head of the South Australian government. They are the leaders of the political party which has a majority of the seats in the Legislative Assembly. Before the 1890s when there was no formal party system in South Australia, politicians usually held liberal or conservative beliefs. The liberals dominated government from 1893 to 1905 with Labor support, with the conservatives mostly in opposition. Labor took government with the support of eight liberals in 1905 when Labor gained more seats than the liberals. The rise of Labor meant the other groups began to become anti-labor parties. The conservatives merged with the Liberal and Democratic Union (formed in 1906) to become the Liberal Union in 1910. No "country" or rural conservative parties have lasted in South Australian state politics. 

Labor formed South Australia's first majority government after winning the 1910 state election. This was two weeks after federal Labor formed Australia's first majority government after winning the 1910 federal election. 

The first six Governors of South Australia ran the government from 1836 until responsible government was began in 1856.

Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy

The "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" is a dance for a ballerina. It is the third movement in "The Nutcracker pas de deux". This "pas de deux" is from Act 2 of the 1892 ballet "The Nutcracker". It is danced by the principal female dancer. The number was choreographed by Lev Ivanov to music written by Tchaikovsky. 

Choreographer Marius Petipa wanted the Sugar Plum Fairy's music to sound like "drops of water shooting from a fountain". Tchaikovsky found the ideal instrument to do this job in Paris in 1891. It was then that he came across the recently invented "celesta". This instrument looked like a piano. It sounded like bells. Tchaikovsky wrote, "[The celesta is] midway between a tiny piano and a Glockenspiel, with a divinely wonderful sound." He wanted to use the celesta in "The Nutcracker". He asked his publisher to buy one. He wanted to keep the purchase a secret. He did not want other Russian composers to "get wind of it and ... use it for unusual effects before me." 

Tchaikovsky introduced the "celesta" to Russian music lovers on 19 March 1892 when the "Nutcracker Suite" was performed for the Russian Musical Society in St. Petersburg. The instrument is forever identified with the Sugar Plum Fairy. It is heard in other parts of Act 2 of "The Nutcracker" besides the Sugar Plum Fairy's dance. The "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" is one of the ballet's best known musical numbers. It is often "jazzed up" for television commercials at Christmas time. 

There is little information about the Sugar Plum Fairy's original choreography. In the first performances the "presto" at the end of the dance was cut. According to Roland John Wiley, the dance appears to have consisted of short "pointe" steps, "petite batteries", and "attitudes" in various combinations. He describes the dance as having "a sense of dynamic build up: from delicate angularity ... to circular shapes, to plainer but more virtuoso movements"pirouettes" to "rounds de jambe"near the end." 

The first Sugar Plum Fairy was Antonietta Dell'Era. She was a good technician, but Tchaikovsky's brother Modest described her as pudgy and unattractive. Although the Sugar Plum Fairy is the "prima ballerina" of "The Nutcracker", she has very little dancing to do. This was a considered a major defect among early critics. Dell'Era tried to expand the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy in later performances by putting a gavotte by Czibulka into the score. 


Black-and-white ruffed lemur

The black-and-white ruffed lemur ("Varecia variegata") is a threatened species native to the eastern coasts of Madagascar. Including the tail, black-and-white ruffed lemurs are one of the largest of the lemurs in the world, being 4 feet tall and weighing 10 pounds. They can live up to 18 years in captivity. Like all ruffed lemurs, they get their name from the thick fur that surrounds their whole head.

Black-and-white ruffed lemurs mainly eat fruits, leaves, seeds and nectar, and insects. In captivity, some zoos will include biscuits to their meals.

Pear (color)

Pear is a pale chartreuse yellowish color that looks like the color of the outer surface of Anjou or Bartlett pears. 



Lycopod

The Lycopods (Lycopodiophyta or Lycophyta) are the oldest surviving vascular plant division. This is a subdivision of the plant kingdom. Its earliest fossils are from 428–410 million years ago.

The Lycopods include some of the most primitive (basal) living species. They reproduce by shedding spores and have macroscopic alternation of generations. Members of Lycopodiophyta have a protostele, and the sporophyte generation is dominant.

Lycopods differ from all other vascular plants in having microphylls, leaves that have only a single vein rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in ferns and seed plants.

The lycopods, or club mosses, are the main plants in the Carboniferous rain forests. They were only partly eaten by insects and other life-forms. Mostly they formed swamplands which in the course of time became coal measures. In fact most of the coal from the Carboniferous period comes from these swamplands.

There are around 1,200 living species of Lycopodiophyta; they are generally divided into three orders. There are also some extinct groups. There are different opinions as to how the whole group should be classified. Living groups are:


Marie Bashir

Dame Marie Roslyn Bashir (born 1 December 1930) is the 37th Governor of New South Wales, and the first woman to hold the position. She was appointed on 1 March 2001. She was born in Narrandera, New South Wales, and later went to the Sydney Girls High School. She studied medicine and surgery at the University of Sydney, graduating in 1956. She worked in mental health, and became the Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Sydney. She was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1988 for her services to child and adolescent health.

From 1957 until his death in 2018, Bashir was married to former Sydney Lord Mayor Sir Nicholas Shehadie.

Cecil Woodham-Smith

Cecil Blanche Woodham-Smith ("née" Fitzgerald; 29 April 1896 – 16 March 1977) was a British historian. She wrote "The Great Hunger" about the history of the Potato Famine in Ireland. She was critical of the British government's handling of the famine in the book. She was particularly critical of Charles Edward Trevelyan, the man who ran the British government's relief effort in Ireland, and accused him of having anti-Irish racial sentiments.

Solenn Colléter

Solenn Colléter is a French novelist born in Paris in 1974. Graduate from "École nationale de l'aviation civile" ("French civil aviation university" ; promotion 1993), she is the author of "Je suis morte et je n’ai rien appris" ("I am dead and I learned nothing" ; "Éditions Albin Michel") about hazing in university studies.



Surrogacy

Surrogacy means getting pregnant and carrying a child for other persons/person who will become the child's parents\parent after their birth. Some reasons why people may look for surrogacy is if a single man wants a child, pregnancy is too much of a risk, or if a woman can't have children through their own pregnancy. The carrier of the children is called a surrogate mother.

It may or may not involve monetary arrangements between the surrogate and the biological parents. In some countries like China, Japan, Germany and France it is considered illegal. In Australia and New Zealand commercial surrogacy is an offence. India is the main destination for this as surrogacy here is cheaper.


Manicouagan crater

The Manicouagan crater is one of the oldest known impact craters. It is in the Côte-Nord region of Québec, Canada.

It was caused by the impact of a diameter asteroid about 215.5 million years ago, in the Upper Triassic.

The crater is a multiple-ring structure about across. Its inner ring is its most prominent feature. This is a diameter annular lake, the Manicouagan Reservoir, surrounding an inner island plateau. It is the earth's fifth largest confirmed impact crater.

The Manicouagan crater may have been part of a multiple impact event which also formed the Rochechouart crater in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, Obolon' crater in Ukraine, and Red Wing crater in North Dakota. The five craters form a chain, indicating the breakup and subsequent impact of an asteroid or comet, like the impacts of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter in 1994.

Laser argon-argon dating of the glass formed by the impacts, and stratigraphic evidence, support an age of 215 ± 25 mya. The impact places have moved far apart in the intervening 214 million years. Three of the craters—Rochechouart, Manicouagan and Saint Martin—formed a chain at latitude 22.8° N, while Obolon' and Red Wing lay on identical declination paths with Rochechouart and Saint Martin respectively. All of the craters had previously been known and studied, but their paleoalignment had never before been demonstrated. The chance that these craters could be aligned like this accidentally are nearly zero.

−1 (number)

In mathematics, −1 (negative one or minus one) is the additive inverse of 1. That is, if it is added to 1, the result is 0. It is the negative integer greater than negative two (−2) and less than 0.

−1 has some similar properties as positive one. But some are different.

−1 is related to Euler's identity. This is because the identity states formula_1

In computer science, −1 is a common initial value for integers. It is also used to show that a variable has no useful information.

Multiplying a number by −1 is the same as changing the sign on the number. This can be proved using the distributive law and the axiom at 1 is the multiplicative identity, that is, a number multiplied by 1 is the number itself. So, for x real, we have

where we used the fact that 0 multiplied by any real number x equals 0, shown by cancellation from the equation

In other words,

so (−1) · "x" or −"x" is the arithmetic inverse of "x".

The square of −1, i.e. −1 multiplied by −1, equals 1. So, a square of negative real numbers is positive.

To prove this with algebra, start with the equation

The first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1, that is, when added to 1, it gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that

The second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity, that is : formula_7. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation means

The above arguments hold in any ring. Ring is a concept of abstract algebra generalizing integers and real numbers.

The complex number "i" satisfies "i" = −1. So it is a square root of −1. The only other complex number "x" for which the equation "x" = −1 holds is −"i". In the algebra of quaternions, which has the complex plane, the equation "x" = −1 has an infinity of solutions.

A non-zero real number can have a negative number as its power. We define that "x" = 1/"x". This means a number raised to a power of −1 is equal to the reciprocal of that number. The exponential law "x""x" = "x" for a,b non-zero real numbers is true even if a or b is negative.

There are many ways that −1 (and negative numbers in general) can be represented in computer systems. The most common is as two's complement of their positive form. In standard binary representation, this can also represent a positive integer.

There are several types of Japanese saws:




MD5

MD5 is a special algorithm, a mathematical process, used to make computer information secure and safe. MD5 stands for Message Digest, and was made to replace the MD4 standard. 

It is mainly used for security in database systems. The algorithm generates a unique hash code for every piece of data (strings, text etc.). Any change to the data, either deliberate or accidental, will mean the hash code will also change. By comparing the codes, it is easy to see if a change has been made. MD5 was invented by Ron Rivest of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991. An MD5 hash code provides a 32-digit hexadecimal number. By 1996, methods were developed to break the security of an MD5 algorithm. This was done by getting another program to make the same hash number for different sets of data. MD5 is no longer considered acceptable for protecting against intentional malicious changes to data, but it is still considered OK to protect from accidental changes, for example single-bit changes caused by noise on a network connection. An MD5 hash could look like: 9c677286866aad38f8e9b660f5411814. This is the hash of the string "Wikipedia".

Mass gathering medicine

Mass Gathering Medicine is a field of medicine which deals with health effects/risks of mass gatherings, that generate a higher incidence of injury and illness, may be the subject to a catastrophic accident or attack with large numbers of injured or dead persons.

Such factors as the weather, duration of the event, movement of the crowd, containment of the event (fenced/contained or not), availability of alcohol/drugs, the density of the crowd et al., possibility for spreading of communicable diseases all influence the health care at mass gatherings.

Purposes of Mass Gathering Medical Services at an event are: rapid access to the injured or ill patients, effective stabilizing and transporting injured or ill patients, on-site care for minor injuries and illnesses. Mass gathering medicine support requires planning.

The World Health Organization supports Member States hosting mass gatherings.

Administrator of the Northern Territory

The Administrator of the Northern Territory is the person selected by the Governor-General of Australia to act as the governor of the Northern Territory of Australia. The selection of Administrator is made by the Governor-General-in-Council, that is, the Governor-General acting on the "advice" of the Australian government, not the advice of the Government of the Northern Territory.

The Northern Territory became self-governing on 1 July 1978. Now the Governor-General-in Council accepts a "recommendation" from the Northern Territory Government. Unlike an Australian State Governor, the Administrator does not represent the Queen in the Territory. They represent the Governor-General who is the Queen's representative in the Commonwealth. The Administrator's role is to govern the Territory under the law which gave it self-government. The Administrator's constitutional role is almost the same as a State Governor and can be considered the Queen's "indirect" representative in the Territory.

The office of the "Deputy of the Administrator" was created in 1997.

The present Administrator is Sally Thomas, AM.

The Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1846 to 1912. The administrator was known as the Government Resident.

The Australian government took over control of the Northern Territory in 1912.

There was an experiment having an extra Government Resident (Central Australia) in Alice Springs based at The Residency. Alice Springs was known as Stuart Town from 1888 to 1933.

The office of the "Deputy of the Administrator" was established in 1997.


Spring bud

Spring bud is the color that used to be called "spring green" before the X11 web color spring green was formulated in 1987 when the X11 colors were first invented. This color is now called "spring bud" to avoid confusion with the web color.

The color spring bud is also called soft spring green or spring green (traditional).

The first written use of "spring green" as a color name in English (meaning the color that is now called "spring bud") was in 1766.

Septicemic plague

Septicemic (or septicaemic) plague is a deadly blood infection. It is one of the three main forms of plague (the other two being the bubonic and penumonic). It is caused by the bacterium "Yersinia pestis".

Septicemic plague can cause the blood to form small blood clots through the body. Without treatment it is almost always fatal. The death rate in medieval times was 99-100 percent. Septicemic plague is the rarest of the three plagues that struck Europe in 1348, the other forms are bubonic and pneumonic plague. This disease is caused mainly by the bite of an infected rodent or insect. In rare cases it can also enter the body through an opening in the skin or by cough from another infected human. 

In septicemic plague the bacteria grow quickly in the blood, causing severe sepsis. The endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This is tiny clots of blood throughout the body which stops the blood getting to some areas. This causes the cells in the area to die. DIC uses up the bodies ability to make blood clot, so that it can no longer control bleeding. This means there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and coughing up or vomiting of blood (hemoptysis/haemoptysis). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites. These bumps are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the death rate to between 4 and 15 percent. People that get this disease must receive treatment in at most 24 hours or they will die. In some cases, people may even die on the same day they get the disease.


Note: Septicemic plague may cause death before any symptoms occur

The septicemic plague was the least common of the three plagues that occurred from 1348 to 1350. Like the others, the septicemic plague spread from the East through trade routes on the Black Sea and down to the Mediterranean Sea. Major port cities such as Venice and Florence were hit the hardest. The three plagues that are part of the Black Death were a major factor in the Peasant's Revolt of 1381.

Titian

Tiziano Vecellio (sometimes his last name is given as "Vecelli", born around 1490, in Pieve di Cadore near Belluno, died 27 August 1576 in Venice) was an Italian painter. His name in English is Titian. He was one of the leading painters of the 16th century Venetian school; he is also seen as one of the principal artists of High Renaissance painting of the 16th century. When he was alive, he was often called "Da Cadore", after his place of birth.

When he was active, the Republic of Venice had a Golden Age, and was well-off economically. Aged nine, Titian went to Venice. The brothers Gentile and Giovanni Bellini taught him how to paint. In 1513, he opened his own shop, and developed into a successful painter, known all over Europe. In 1533, Charles V made him a nobleman. He also obtained a job as a painter at the court of Charles V. In 1545, Pope Paul III invited him to come to Rome, in 1548 and 1550, Titian accompanied Charles V and his son, Philip II to the Diet of Augsburg. When Titian died of the Plague in the year 1576, he was an old man. He was also one of the most famous painters of Venetian history.

Titian was very productive: in total, he painted 676 works. He did portraits, landscapes, as well as themes from mythology and religious works. All his works are very colorful. This special use of color influenced other painters of the same period a great deal. His works influenced painters such as Peter Paul Rubens, Antoine Watteau and Eugène Delacroix.

Giorgione

Giorgio Barbarelli da Castelfranco ( born 1477 or 1478, died 1510) was a Venetian painter. He is commonly known as Giorgione. He died a little over 30, probably of the plague. Today, only about six paintings can be clearly attributed to him. This makes him one of the most mysterious painters of his time. Together with Titian he was one of the most influential painters of his period. He was one of the first Venitian Painters to use Oil Paints for a medium.


Hamza Ben Driss Ottmani

Hamza Ben Driss Ottmani (10 May 1940 – 30 May 2012) was a Moroccan economist and writer.

Hamza studied Aerospace engineering at "École nationale de l'aviation civile" (the French civil aviation university; promotion 1963) and was an economist graduate from "ENSAE ParisTech."

He is known as a writer. His work focuses on his hometown, Essaouira.

His first book, ""Une cité sous les alizés"" ("a city under the trade winds"), is a historical study of Mogador-Essaouira from prehistory to World War II. He then turned to fiction but retained a strong historical basis.

In ""Si Mogador m'était contée"" ("If Mogador could talk"), the old narrator, Lalla Aïcha, revives twenty stories from the ignored past of the city. ""Le Soldat qui venait de Mogador"" ("The soldier who came from Mogador") tells the story of the trip to Mecca of Si Taieb El Ech Chiadmi Maskali, in 1912. 

""Le Fils du Soleil"" ("Son of the Sun") is a historical novel that tells the amazing story of Mustapha Zemmouri, better known under the name Estevanico, who was a Moroccan from the Azemmour region, was kidnapped by a Spanish man as a slave and brought to America where he became one of the first discoverers of Arizona and New Mexico. 


Ivan Vsevolozhsky

Ivan Alexandrovich Vsevolozhsky (; 1835–1909) was a Russian diplomat, theatre director, librettist, and designer. He served as Director of the Imperial Theatres for Saint Petersburg from 1886 to 1899. He commissioned Tchaikovsky to compose the ballets "The Sleeping Beauty" (1890) and "The Nutcracker" (1892). He wrote the libretti for both ballets with Marius Petipa. Vsevolozhsky designed costumes and scenery for 25 operas and ballets. In 1899, he was appointed Director of the Hermitage Museum. He remained in this post until his death in 1909.

Troy McClure

Troy McClure is a character in The Simpsons voiced by Phil Hartman. He first appeared in the episode "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment". McClure is a washed-up actor, usually shown doing low-level work, such as hosting infomercials and educational movies. He appears as the central character in "A Fish Called Selma", in which he marries Selma Bouvier to protect his career from failing and quash rumors about his personal life. McClure also 'hosts' two episodes named "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular" and "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase".

McClure was based on B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure as well as Hartman himself. Following Hartman's murder on May 28, 1998, the character no longer appeared on the show, making his final appearance in the tenth season in "Bart the Mother". McClure is often cited as one of the series' most popular characters; in 2006 IGN ranked him first on their list of the "Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters".

The Dream of Gerontius

The Dream of Gerontius is a large musical work for choir: three solo singers and orchestra composed by Edward Elgar. It was composed and first performed in 1900. It is an oratorio, although Elgar did not like it being called an “oratorio”, but this is how it is usually described. It is usually thought of as the best choral work Elgar ever wrote.

The words are from a poem by John Henry Newman. They are supposed to be the words of a man called Gerontius who is dying. He imagines what is going to happen to him when he dies: how he will meet God who will judge whether he has been good enough to go to heaven. The angel speaks to him in the poem. There is also a priest, and a short solo for the Angel of Agony. The work is in two parts. Part I is about 40 minutes long and Part II lasts about an hour.

The work was composed for the Birmingham Music Festival of 1900 and the first performance took place on 3 October 1900, in Birmingham Town Hall. There were problems at the first performance: the chorus master died while the work was being learned. Some of the music sounded strange to the choir who found it very difficult. The soloists were not very good, and it was difficult for the conductor, Hans Richter (who was an excellent conductor) to stop the choir from singing out of tune. Richter had not had time to prepare the work properly: he was only given the full score on the day before the first rehearsal. The next year the work was performed in Germany where it was well received.

Another reason why it was slow to become popular in England was that the ideas in the poem were from the Roman Catholic teaching (John Henry Newman was a Roman Catholic Cardinal). This meant that a lot of Anglican cathedrals did not want it to be performed, so changes were made to the text. This new version was used for performances at the Three Choirs Festival until 1910. It quickly became popular in England. It was performed in Chicago and New York in 1903, and then in many other cities.

A few years earlier it had been suggested to the Birmingham Festival that Antonín Dvořák should be commissioned to compose a work on “The Dream of Gerontius”. They decided that the work was “too catholic”.

There are three solo singers in the work. The most important is the tenor soloist who sings the words spoken by the dying Gerontius. There is also a bass who sings the Priest, and a mezzo-soprano who sings the part of the angel. The Angel of the Agony can be sung by the same bass who sings the Priest. The choir sometimes divides into two, and sometimes there is a small group of upper voices called the “semi-chorus”.

Newman's poem tells the story of a soul's journey through death. It is thinking about the unseen world of Roman Catholic theology. The name Gerontius comes from the Greek word "geron", "old man". The name "Gerontius" is not sung in the work, and not everyone agrees on how it is pronounced. The Greek "geron" has a hard 'g' (like in “grass”), but English words that come from it often have a soft 'g', as in "geriatriac". Elgar did not use all the words of Newman’s poem. He leaves out a lot of the meditations in Part 2 which would otherwise have made it very long.

In the first part, we hear Gerontius who is very faithful to God. Sometimes he is frightened but at other times he is hopeful. A group of friends (also called "assistants" in the text) joins him in prayer and meditation. He passes in peace, and a priest, with the assistants, say farewell as he sets off on his journey. In the second part, Gerontius, now called "The Soul", wakes up in a place apparently without space or time, and becomes aware that his guardian angel is there. She is happy that her task (bringing Gerontius to God) is done (the angel in Newman’s poem is male, but Elgar makes the angel female, giving the part to a female singer). They have a long conversation after which they journey to the throne of judgement. They have to pass the demons. They meet a choir of angels who are praising god. The Angel of the Agony pleads with Jesus to spare the souls of the faithful. Finally Gerontius briefly sees God and is judged in a single moment. The Guardian Angel lowers Gerontius into the soothing lake of Purgatory, gives him a final blessing, and promises him he will wake up in glory.

Elgar scored the work for a large orchestra which includes, besides the usual instruments, piccolo, cor anglais, contrabassoon, harp and organ.

Although people usually describe it as an oratorio, it is not an oratorio in the traditional sense: there are no breaks in the music (except between the two parts), and it does not tell a story from the Bible.

The music is written in a late Romantic style which is clearly inspired by Wagner, especially by his opera Parsifal. The opening of “The Dream of Gerontius” is a long orchestral introduction which uses themes that are going to be important in the work. The music of the character Gerontius is sometimes in speech rhythm (similar to recitative) but often very lyrical. Elgar moves quickly from one style to the other. The chorus provides a wonderful reflection on what is happening. The chorus of angels singing “Praise to the Holiest in the Height” is particularly beautiful. The chorus of demons is very difficult to sing. Notably, the moment where Gerontius is judged by God does not feature the choir. Instead, the orchestra has crescendos until climax and then decrescendos.

Flag of Afghanistan

The recognized flag of Afghanistan continues to be that of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Although the Taliban flag, which was used from 1997-2001 until their collapse, has reemerged under the name of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as of 2021.

Afghanistan has had more changes of its national flag during the 20th century than any other country in the world. It has had 20 different flags since the first flag in 1747. In only 4 years (1926–1930), Afghanistan had 7 flag changes - many of these flags were used as the nation's flags for only a few months.

National anthem of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

The "Afghan National Anthem" (; ) was used between 2006 and 2021. The words of the song were written by an Afghan poet named Abdul Bari Jahani, and the melody for his words were created by an German-Afghan composer named Babrak Wassa. It was "de facto" replaced by "This is the Home of the Brave" after the Taliban takeover in 2021.

After the end of Taliban rule in 2001, a new national anthem was made for the "New Afghanistan". According to the 20th article of the new Afghan constitution, it would have the names of the many ethnic groups of Afghanistan. It said the phrase ""Allāhu Akbar"" ("God is the greatest") had to be in it. After a competition, "Millī Surūd" was made the official national anthem in May 2006.

After the Taliban takeover on 15 August 2021, it was replaced by "This is the Home of the Brave". However, in the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup between October and November, it was still played as the national anthem of Afghanistan. The flag of the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was also used. The Islamic Republic anthem and flag were also used in the 2022 CAFA U-19 Futsal Championship.

Similar to Romania, Afghanistan has used a bunch of other anthems in the past. A lot of times is due to the government of Afghanistan changing many times. When the country was ruled by a king, two national anthems were used: "Royal Salute" and "Grand Salute". Then right when Afghanistan was no longer ruled by a king, a new national anthem was used, but only for five years. Soon after, Afghanistan became a socialist republic and a national anthem for that was used. But that came to an end in 1992, when Afghanistan became an Islamic state, so another anthem was used.

During the late 1990s, the Taliban took control over most of Afghanistan and ruled most of the country until late 2001. This was when the United States started a war (against the Taliban and al-Qaeda) right after 9/11. The Taliban were the winners in that war, so as of August 2021, Afghanistan is an Islamic Emirate to this day, and "This is the Home of the Brave" is now the country's national anthem.

President of Afghanistan

The President of Afghanistan was the head of state of Afghanistan. Afghanistan has only been a republic between 1973 and 1992 and from 2001 onwards. Before 1973, it was a monarchy that was governed by a variety of kings, emirs or shahs. There was a civil war from 1992 to 2001.

After the 2021 Taliban offensive and the near seizure of the capital, incumbent President Ashraf Ghani fled Afghanistan to Tajikistan on 15 August 2021. After Ghani fled the country, the Taliban occupied the Presidential Palace. The office was abolished on 6th September 2021.

The constitution of Afghanistan gave the president wide powers over military and legislative affairs. There was a weak national parliament.

Van der Waals force

In chemistry, the van der Waals force is a type of intermolecular force that attracts molecules together. An intermolecular force is a relatively weak force between molecules. Van der Waals forces are the weakest type of intermolecular force. They are named after the Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals (1837–1923).

Negatively charged electrons orbit around molecules or ions. The electrons shift their orbits to create slightly different charges from one end of the molecule to the other as a response to each other. These slight differences are called "partial charges", described by using the variables δor δ. 

Van der Walls force is sometimes used loosely to mean for "all" intermolecular forces. Van der Waals forces are weaker than covalent bonds and usually weaker than hydrogen bonds, but they play a important role in supramolecular chemistry, enzymes, polymer science, nanotechnology, surface science, and condensed matter physics.

It is linked by roads to Kunduz in the east, Kabul in the south-east, Herat to the west and Uzbekistan to the north. The city is a major tourist attraction in Afghanistan because of its famous shrines as well as the Muslim and Hellenistic archeological sites. In 2006, the discovery of new Hellenistic remains was announced.

The region around Mazar-e-Sharif has been historically part of Greater Khorasan and was controlled by the Tahirids followed by the Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Ilkhanates, Timurids, and Khanate of Bukhara.

The name Mazar-e-Sharif means "Noble Shrine". This name represents the Blue Mosque which is widely known to be the grave of Hazrat Ali (prophet Mohammad's son-in-law).

The city and region became part of the Afghan Durrani Empire around 1750.

Mazar-e Sharif remained peaceful for the next one hundred years. In 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. During the 1980s Soviet war, Mazari Sharif was a strategic base for the Soviet Army.

Between May and July 1997, the Taliban unsuccessfully attempted to take Mazar. About 3,000 Taliban soldiers were killed by Abdul Malik and his Shia followers. The Taliban returned on August 8, 1998 and led a six-day killing frenzy of Hazaras. Soon after, the city was occupied and taken over by the Taliban.

Following 9/11, Mazar Sharif was the first Afghan city to fall to the Northern Alliance (United Front). The Taliban's defeat in Mazar quickly turned into defeat from the rest of the north and west of Afghanistan. On November 9, 2001 the city was captured by the Afghan Northern Alliance forces after the Battle of Mazar e Sharif with help from the United States Special Operations Forces and bombing by U.S. Air Force aircraft. As many as 2,000 Taliban fighters who surrendered were reportedly massacred by the Northern Alliance after the battle. Reports also place U.S. ground troops at the scene of the massacre.
There were also NATO peacekeeping forces in and around the city providing assistance to the Afghan government.

The population of Mazari Sharif is around 375,000. It is a multiethnic and multilingual society.

The main language in Mazari Sharif is Dari (Persian) followed by Pashto. Both are official languages of Afghanistan.

The city is a centre for the traditional buzkashi sport, and the Blue Mosque is the focus of Afghanistan's Nawroz celebration.

Mazar-e Sharif serves as the major trading center in northern Afghanistan. It was the first city to connect by rail with a neighboring country. The rail service from Mazar-e Sharif to Uzbekistan began in 2011 and is expected to rapidly boost the economy of the city. Cargo on freight trains arrives to the last station near Mazar-i-Sharif Airport, where the goods are reloaded onto trucks or airplanes and sent to their last destinations across Afghanistan.

The local economy is mainly trade, agriculture and karakul production. Some oil and gas has also boosted the city's economy.

The modern city of Mazar-i Sharif is centered around the Shrine of Hazrat Ali. Much restored, it is one of Afghanistan's most glorious monuments. Outside Mazar-i Sharif lies the ancient city of Balkh.

History of Azerbaijan

The history of Azerbaijan goes back centuries before the USSR was formed. The population of Azerbaijan is a native to the Caucasus area, which are of turk descent.

In the 7th century, Islam was introduced with the Arab conquest, which was important in the formation of a single nation and language in Azerbaijan, when the population became Muslim. A common religion for both Turkic and non-Turkic ethnic groups brought about the formation of common traditions, and the integration between the different ethnic groups living on the territory of Azerbaijan. By the middle of the 9th century, the Turkic ethnic group, the Azerbaijani people became the major ethnic group.

The establishment of a single state in Azerbaijan happened between the 15th century and the 18th century. This period is very important in the history of Azerbaijan. The ruler Shah Ismail Khatai (1501-1524) who was of Azerbaijani origin, united all the territories of Azerbaijan under his control. He founded the Safavid dynasty with Tabriz as its capital. During the rule of the Safavis, the Azerbaijani language also became the only official language. After the Safavid dynasty ended, Nadir Shah Afshar (1736-1747), an Azerbaijani commander founded the Afsharid dynasty (1736-1796) named after himself, and continued to rule over Azerbaijan's territories. He strengthened the borders and in 1739 invaded North India including Delhi. After Nadir Shah's death, his dynasty weakened and in the second part of the 18th century resulted in the formations of new smaller states.

In the late 18th century, then, the government of Iran passed to the Qajar dynasty (1796-1925), who were also of Azerbaijani origin. Their main policy was to unite all the territories once ruled by their ancestors. This gave the start to several long wars between the Qajars and Russia, with both parties aiming to occupy the South Caucasus which Azerbaijan is a part of. Azerbaijan was divided between the two empires. The northern part of Azerbaijan was annexed to Russia, while the south went to Iran. This is the origin of today's political division between "North Azerbaijan" which today has become the Republic of Azerbaijan, and "South Azerbaijan", which today is a part of Iran.

Azerbaijan came under Russian rule after the Persian-Russian wars of 1804-1813. The country gained independence for a short period, however, towards the end of the First World War. After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, Azerbaijan, together with Armenia and Georgia formed the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. When this republic ended in May 1918, Azerbaijan declared independence as the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan on May 28, 1918, as the first modern and secular parliamentary republic in the Muslim World. However, the Red Army occupied the territory and annexed it to the newly formed Soviet Union and the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was founded on April 28, 1920. 

During the Second World War and after, the Azerbaijan SSR, as a petroleum producer, was important in the energy policy of the Soviet Union. Following the politics of reforms called "glasnost", started by the leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev, riots and ethnic fighting grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of the Azerbaijan SSR. The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to the Soviet government's lack of response to the already tense conflict between the Azerbaijanis and Armenians, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which resulted in the massacre known as "Black January" in the capital Baku in January 1990. Azerbaijan eventually declared independence on October 18, 1991. The Soviet Union was ended on December 25, 1991.

When Azerbaijan became independent, the conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh turned into the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1991-1994.

The politician Heydar Aliyev became the President of Azerbaijan in 1993 and successfully stabilized the country and a ceasefire between Azerbaijan and Armenia was signed in 1994, which paused the war. However, 20 % of Azerbaijan remained occupied by the Armenian military and the two countries were in a state of war, until November, 2020. Nevertheless, representatives of the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan have since been holding peace talks organized by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) "Minsk Group" to solve the conflict and restore the territory to Azerbaijan. When Heydar Aliyev died in 2003, his son Ilham Aliyev became the President of Azerbaijan and is continuing his father's policies today. As an important producer of petroleum and natural gas, Azerbaijan's economy is increasing very rapidly every year, and has become rich as a result.

Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance

Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance is a diagnostic method in epidemiology. It was used in the Soviet Japanese campaign in WWII immediately behind the first tanks and mechanized vehicles of advancing Soviet army in case they encounter any contagious disease. The withdrawing enemy forces had poisoned many wells and water sources. The Polish contingents serving under the UN focused their tasks among others on … sanitary-epidemiological reconnaissance … Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance is a collection and transfer of all data available on sanitary and epidemiological situation of the area of possible action of armed forces. The aim is to clear up the specific disease origin- sources of the infection in extreme situations, including local wars and armed conflicts, the ways of the infection transfer. It should reveal the people suspected to the disease, and lead to their isolation and hospitalization. A group includes: epidemiologist, specialist in infections, bacteriologist- lab assistant), and medical orderly. The group may need a zoologist or parasitologist. After the armed forces have stopped moving the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance turns into sanitary and epidemiological surveillance of the activity of the armed forces.

In 2010 at The Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and Their Destruction in Geneva the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance was suggested as means for monitoring of infections and parasitic agents and for practical implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005). The aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases and the threat of use of biological weapons. The reconnaissance will be important in assessing the situation, organizing and conducting preventive activities, indicating and identifying pathogenic biological agents, suppressing infectious diseases, and providing advisory and practical assistance to local health authorities.

Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance should be performed immediately after the receiving of information about a bio-terrorism attack.

Cambridge Airport

Cambridge Airport (previously Marshall Airport Cambridge UK) is a small regional airport in South Cambridgeshire, England. It is on the eastern edges of Cambridge, south of Newmarket Road and west of the village of Teversham, from the centre of Cambridge and about from London. 

The airport opened in 1938. It replaced the old airfield at Fen Ditton. The airport is owned and run by Marshall Aerospace. This is a Cambridge-based company with many years' history servicing civilian and military contracts. The main building was designed by the architect Harold Tomlinson of the University of Cambridge. It was constructed in 1936–37. For many years it was the base for the Cambridge University Air Squadron.

Marshall of Cambridge Aerospace Limited has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P433). This is a special license that allows it to have public passenger flights and flights for flying training. It has four flying schools. It is also used for corporate and private flights.

In October 2008, the airport's name was changed from Cambridge City Airport to Marshall Airport Cambridge UK. This happened at the same time as the new Marshall Business Aviation Centre was opened. In 2011, Cambridge Airport officially broke off from Marshall. It hired a new director and changed its name back to Cambridge Airport. Its aim is to become a "hub" (important airport) for the east of England. The Passenger Terminal will be refurbished.

Land in Cambridge is expensive. Around the city are large areas of green belt land. Building new houses on this land is not allowed. Because of this, a proposal was made in 2000 to move the airport to a new site away from the city. It would have freed up of land so that several thousand new homes could be built there instead. Cambridgeshire County Council did a study for a new airport. The council asked for permission to plan the new airport, but they withdrew the request later.

Since then, Marshall Aerospace has continued to develop the site. In autumn 2008 new facilities for aviation companies were opened. These included a new hangar, which added to the of hangar space already on the site.

In April 2010, Marshall Aerospace said it would not be moving Cambridge Airport to make way for new housing. RAF Mildenhall, Waterbeach Barracks and RAF Wyton were though of as alternative sites, but Marshall decided that there were "no suitable relocation options" (none of the options were good enough). 

In January 2011, Cambridge Airport broke off from Marshall, and released plans for the airport's future. Its plans are to have international flights for the London 2012 Olympic Games. For 2012 the airport has introduced new international holiday charter flights to Europe as well as new regular (on a timetable) air links to the Channel Islands. Passenger terminal facilities are being fully upgraded to improve services and convenience for passengers. The airport is planning to add flights to more places that are important for business and leisure.

Bias (textile)

The bias of a piece of woven fabric is at 45 degrees to its warp and weft threads. Every piece of woven fabric has two biases, at right angles to each other. Fabrics which are not woven, such as felt, do not have a bias.

When cut on the bias, woven fabric is more elastic as well as more fluid in movement, compared to the on-grain direction. This helps many types of garment, such as skirts, dresses and neckties.

The "bias-cut" is a technique used by tailors and dress-makers for cutting cloth. The greater stretch in the bias (diagonal) direction of the fabric, helps it accentuate body lines and curves and drape softly. For example, a full-skirted dress cut on the bias will hang more gracefully or a narrow dress will cling to the figure. 

Bias-cut garments were prominent in haute couture clothes designed by Madeleine Vionnet in the 1920s. It is still used often in both haute couture and high street clothing. In the Middle Ages, before the development of knitting, hose leggings were cut on the bias in order to make them fit better.

Madeleine Vionnet

Madeleine Vionnet (22 June 1876 – 2 March 1975) was a French fashion designer. She used the bias cut, made Grecian-style dresses and introduced haute couture design to high street shops.

Born into a poor family in Chilleurs-aux-Bois, Loiret, Vionnet began her apprenticeship as a seamstress at age 11. After a brief marriage at age 18, she left her husband and went to London to work making clothes in a hospital. While in London, Vionnet worked as a fitter for Kate Reily (or Reilly). Reily bought original French designer dresses and brought them to her London workshop. There she had them copied, and sold the copies to her London clients for half the price of the originals. Vionnet was head of her workshop ("atelier"), cutting, fitting and directing the seamstresses.

Vionnet eventually returned to Paris and trained with well known fashion houses. In 1912 she founded her own fashion house, "Vionnet". In the 1920s she created a stir by re-introducing the bias cut, an old technique for cutting cloth diagonal to the grain of the fabric. She developed techniques for managing the problems the bias cut caused. Bias cuts cling to the body and move with the wearer. Vionnet's use of the bias cut to create a sleek, flattering, body-skimming look would change women's clothing and carry her to the top of the fashion world.

Madeleine's clothes were famous for accentuating the natural female form. Influenced by the modern dances of Isadora Duncan, Vionnet created designs that showed off a woman's natural shape. Like Duncan, Vionnet was inspired by ancient Greek art, in which garments appear to float freely around the body rather than distort its shape.

Vionnet's simple-looking styles were not simple to produce. She cut, draped, and pinned fabric designs on to miniature dolls, before recreating them in chiffon, silk, or Moroccan crepe on life-size models. Vionnet used materials such as crêpe de chine, gabardine, and satin to make her clothes; fabrics which were unusual in women's fashion of the 1920s and 30s. She would order fabrics two yards wider than necessary in order to accommodate draping, creating clothes – particularly dresses – that were luxurious and sensual but also simple and modern. Characteristic Vionnet styles included the handkerchief dress, cowl neck, and halter top.

Vionnet influenced the design of mass production "prét à porter" (ready to wear) clothing. She had worked in mass production as a hospital seamstress, and could simplify her designs for the retail market. High fashion was too expensive for working people, and (unlike today) was not copied in the high street. Vionnet's ability to take her designs off the cat walk and into the high street revolutionised the fashion industry and popular culture.


In 1930, Suzanna Laneil was caught with 48 copies of Chanel and Vionnet designs. Vionnet sued her, in a French landmark case. The Court found that the design originals by Vionnet were "real works of art" and that they were "entitled to the same protection accorded authors and copyright holders". That protection has been written into the statute and ratified by European treaties on copyright law. Vionnet began as a style copiest with Kate Reilly, but became a strong supporter of intellectual property protection for designers.

To each according to his contribution

According to the principle of 'To each according to his contribution', during the transition of a society from capitalism to socialism and then to communism, individuals should be rewarded for the amount they contribute to society. Economists such as David Ricardo (1772-1823) had this idea. Ricardo founded a movement that is known as Ricardian socialism today. Many people in the labour movement had this idea too. Ferdinand Lassalle (1825–1864) and Eugen Dühring (1833-1921) expressed such ideas towards Leon Trotsky. Despite this, Vladimir Lenin was the first person to say that this element is fundamental to Marxist theory.

According to Libertarian socialist thinkers, such as American anarchist Benjamin Tucker, socialism is a system in which the laborer receives the full product of his labor. This eliminates exploitation and unearned income accrued to the capitalist.

The term "To each according to his contribution" simply means that each worker in a socialist society receives "wages" and benefits according to the quantity and value of the labor that he or she contributed. That way, highly productive workers will receive more wages and benefits than workers of average productivity, and substantially more than workers of low productivity. What is more, the more difficult the job is, the more one is rewarded for the labor contributed. Difficulty can result from factors such as greater training requirement, job intensity or safety hazards. According to Trotsky, the idea is to promote productivity. This is done by creating incentives to work harder, longer, and more productively. In the end, the principle comes from capitalism, but will vanish, according to Marx, as work becomes more automated and enjoyable, and as goods become available in greater quantities.

In capitalism, the means of production are owned by a few people; these people are also known as the bourgeoisie. These people do not produce, but they live off the work others do for them. Socialism can fix this issue, because with socialism, the means of production are owned by all people, they are a common good.

Architecture of Singapore

The architecture of Singapore shows influences and styles from different places and periods. Singapore architecture may be divided into two periods: the more traditional pre-World War II colonial period, and the modern post-war and post-colonial period.

Malay houses built in the 'kampong' style were common before the British came..

After the British established a settlement near the mouth of the Singapore River in 1819, building construction in Singapore changed. The new settlement was small but very urban. Merchants built warehouses right next to each other along Boat Quay. Risk of fire became a problem because the buildings were so close together and had many valuable goods inside. Builders switched to brick masonry with clay tiled roofs, to reduce the fire hazard. Bricks and tiles were made at kilns on the island, and the mortar and plaster was made by grinding up corals from sea around Singapore.

 Shophouses are common style of building in Southeast Asia. They are usually two or three storeys high. Each shophouse is usually very narrow and part of a long row of terraced buildings. But, shophouses may be very deep front to back. The first floor is usually for business and the upper floors are for living.

The front of the building usually has a covered area called the ""five foot ways"". An 1822 law in Singapore said that all houses made of brick or tiles should be similar in the front. They should have an open arcade making an open passage on each side of the street. This style of building shophouses soon spread to other states in British Malaya. More rules said that the verandah ways should be .at least seven feet from the edge of the road and the walkway must be at least five feet wide.

A bungalow is usually a small one or one-and-half storey home with deep verandahs. In Singapore, Many Europeans lived in bungalows from the 19th century until World War II. They are called Black and Whites for their white paint and dark wood.

These homes were similar to the UK's Arts and Crafts and Art Deco movements. They were built large enough to give rich families homes with light, air, and space. Black-and-Whites were built by wealthy families, successful businesses, the Public Works Department, and the British Armed Forces. Many are still homes today, but some have become shops, restaurants, or bars.

Singapore has many Art Deco buildings from the 1920s and 1930s. The style was especially popular in commercial architecture, like factories and offices. Sometimes the style was only on the surface. Often, Art Deco style ornaments were added to typical shophouses or bungalows. The Art Deco period was important as a style, but also for bringing modern construction technologies like reinforced concrete to Singapore.

Singaporean architecture moved to a modern direction after the war. The need to save money meant less spending on ornaments or features that only looked good. Simple forms and surfaces became more common. Modern architecture was also better for building many public buildings with the same or similar designs such as schools, clinics, factories, and especially public housing.

Public housing started in Singapore in the 1930s. The Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) carried out a building programme because there was not enough housing in the city. The SIT mainly built housing for middle and lower-middle class Asians at first. The Tiong Bahru estate is a typical example. It is a group of four-storey Art Deco style apartment blocks, shops, and markets outside the city center. After the war, the style changed from Art Deco to a simple, modern style.

Modern architecture was most important during the 1970s and 1980s. Brutalist architecture was common. Some older commercial buildings, such as the OCBC Centre by I. M. Pei, and many government office buildings are examples of this style.

Tap dance

Tap dancing is a type of dance. Its main feature is the sound made by tap shoes hitting the floor. Tap dancers wear special shoes with metal pieces on the toes and heels. 

There are two main types of tap dance: rhythm (Jazz) tap and Broadway tap. Broadway tap is more about the dance. It is often done in musical theater. Rhythm tap is more about the sound of the tapping.

In tap dancing dancers use their shoes to tap the floor like drummers. The sound you get from the tap shoe depends on how hard you hit the floor, and what part of your foot you use.

Isadora Duncan

Isadora Duncan (May 27, 1877 – September 14, 1927) was an American dancer. She was an inspiration for modern dance.

Duncan was born in San Francisco, California. She preferred natural movement, instead of what she called the artificial movements of ballet. Her 'free dance movement' was based on simple, flowing movements of the body. It was inspired by nature, and by ancient Greek sculptures. Costumes were flowing and transparent. Dances involved simple runs, skips and jumps, big gestures and mime.

Duncan was wildly unconventional. A bisexual who had two children but did not marry either of their fathers, she became a communist, and boasted about it. She went to the Soviet Union in 1922, but left in less than two years. At different times she lived in Paris, London and other European cities. She started dance schools in Moscow, Berlin and Paris. The schools did not last long, but Duncan had admirers who have continued her influence to the present day.

Duncan's private life was tragic. Both her children were killed in a strange accident on the River Seine in 1913. The children were in a car with their nanny when the car stalled as the driver tried to avoid a collision. He got out to hand-crank the engine, but forgot to put the brake on. The car rolled across the road, down the bank and into the river. The children and their nanny drowned. Duncan married poet Sergei Yesenin (1895–1925) in 1922. He left her in 1923, and hanged himself two years later.

Duncan liked long, flowing scarves. One of these scarves caused her own death. As "The New York Times" noted in its obituary: "Isadora Duncan, the American dancer, tonight met a tragic death at Nice on the Riviera. According to dispatches from Nice, Miss Duncan was hurled in an extraordinary manner from an open automobile in which she was riding and instantly killed". At her death, Duncan was a Soviet citizen.

Born in the United States, she lived in Europe from the age of 22 until her death at age 50. In the United States she was popular only in New York, and then only later in her life.

Her work was continued by some of her six adopted daughters. They were her pupils, the Isadorables, who continued to teach her methods after her death. There have been several revivals of interest in Duncan. There was a film, "Isadora" (1969) by Karl Reisz. There were two ballets. "Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora" by Frederick Ashton had its first show in 1976. Kenneth Macmillan created a two-act ballet "Isadora" for the Royal Ballet (1981).

In New York her tradition has passed to third generation Duncan dancer Lori Belilove. She founded The Isadora Duncan Dance Foundation in 1979 and The Isadora Duncan Dance Company in 1989.

Her ideas on natural dance influenced a wide range of other dancers. Some of the ideas of the Denishawn School of Dancing are quite Duncanesque, and the growth of modern dance in general owes something to her.

Myles Standish

Myles Standish (1584 1656) was an English military officer who was selected to defend the Pilgrims in the New World He travelled on the Mayflower in 1620 and signed the Mayflower Compact. Standish became a assistant governor, and a treasurer of Plymouth Colony.

Standish's place of birth is uncertain. In his will he mentions Lancashire. Nathaniel Morton, secretary of Plymouth Colony, wrote that Standish was born in Lancashire.

Standish was a soldier and fought against the Spanish in the Eighty Years' War.

Standish and his wife did not believe in the Church of England and in 1608 they moved to Leiden Netherlands. After some years, they became concerned because their children were losing their English customs and culture. Since their religion was outlawed in England, they decided to travel to the New World.

There were many people in Leiden who did not believe in the Church of England and they also wanted to travel to the New World. They looked to employ someone who would protect them in the New World. They first asked John Smith. Smith was one of the founders of the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia. He had explored and made a map of the North American coast. Smith's experience would have helped them but he asked for too much money. He was also too bold and they feared he might try to rule over them. They asked Standish instead and he agreed to help protect them. They decided to hire the ship "Mayflower" to take them on their long voyage.

The "Mayflower" left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" saw land. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other.

While the Mayflower was anchored off Cape Cod, Standish took some men ashore to find a good place for all to live.

William Bradford wrote of one of the exploration missions. They were Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty set off in small boats. Hopkins was the most experienced because he had seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. Bradford said they set off in below freezing temperatures. Many of the men were ill, and when they left the salt spray froze on their coats. During their trip they saw Native Americans who appeared to be cutting up a whale which was very large. When they saw the men approaching the Indians fled. At night they tried to protect themselves from the cold and the Indians.

After more trips in late December 1620 they picked a place to live. Standish gave good advice and they built a small fort and placed cannon for protection against any who might try to harm them. Standish's wife, Rose, died in January.

Many passengers were sick but Standish stayed healthy. Standish was a source of great comfort and strength to those who suffered. Standish helped to care Bradford when he was sick and they became good friends. Bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and worked closely with Standish.

In March of 1621, a Native American named Samoset came to the colony and spoke to the people in English. He stayed one day and talked with the leaders about many things. When he returned he brought the tribe leader Massasoit to meet with the Pilgrims. Governor John Carver, signed a treaty with this chief and they became friends. They all promised to help and defend each other. 

In August 1621 a leader named Corbitant tried to turn the people of Nemasket against Massasoit. Standish led a group of ten men to kill Corbitant. Three Native Americans, Squanto, Hobomock and Tisquantum went with them. When Tisquantum and Hobbamock went to Nemasket, Corbitant took Tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him. Hobbamock got away and warned the people of Plymouth.

Standish planned an attack. Standish and Hobbamock went to where they thought Corbitant would be sleeping but he had already fled the village. They did not kill Corbitant but because the colonist were willing to fight, if necessary, nine other leaders, and Corbitant, signed a treaty with the leaders of Plymouth.

In November 1621, a Narragansett messenger came to Plymouth with a bundle of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin. The Pilgrims were told by Tisquantum and Hobbamock that this was a threat and an insult from the Narragansett leader who was called Canonicus. This was one of the more powerful tribes in the area. Bradford sent back the snakeskin filled with gunpowder to show them they were not afraid. Standish told the colonists to prepare for a possible fight. The ship "Fortune" had brought some more men to the colony but there were still not very many men. Standish put one man to each wall and gave them orders on how to protect themselves and the people in case of an attack.

Bradford called a public meeting. The Pilgrims decided to send Standish and a small group of eight, including Hobbamock, to Wessagusset to kill the leaders who wanted kill them. The day after Pecksuot, a Massachusett warrior and leader of the group who threatened Wessagusset, came to the settlement with other warriors. Pecksuot approached Standish and, looking down on him, said, "You are a great captain, yet you are but a little man. Though I not a chief, I am of great strength and courage." He said this to make Standish afraid of him. The next day, Standish attacked Pecksuot, and stabbed him with the Native American's own knife. Standish returned to Plymouth. The leaders who wished them harm had been killed and there was no more threat. The attack also caused many of the unfriendly Native Americans to leave the area.

Standish showed great courage and skill as a soldier but sometimes was too harsh with the Native Americans. This would make both the Native Americans and the members of the colony angry.

By the 1640s, Standish was leading a quiet life on his farm in Duxbury. Standish also served as a surveyor of highways, as Treasurer of the Colony from 1644 to 1649. In 1642, his old friend Hobbamock, who had been part of his household, died and was buried on Standish's farm in Duxbury.

Standish put Lieutenant William Holmes in charge of training the men. He died in his home in 1656. He was buried in Duxbury's Old Burying Ground, now known as the Myles Standish Burial Ground.
Standish's first wife, Rose, died in 1621. She was buried in an unmarked grave at Cole's Hill as were many others who died the first winter and named on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb as "Rose, first wife of Myles Standish".

Standish then married Barbara who died in 1659 They had seven children and her burial place is unknown. Their children were named, Charles, John, Myles, Loara, and Josiah and (again) Charles. The first child named Charles died.

There are two monuments to Myles Standish. One is placed over his grave at the Myles Standish Burial Ground.
The site of Myles Standish's house is now in a small park in the town of Duxbury, Massachusetts.

Standish, Maine, is named after Myles Standish. There are two forts named after Standish: a fort on Plymouth's Saquish Neck built during the American Civil War and a larger fort built in Boston Harbor in 1895.


Scientific revolution

The scientific revolution was a time (15501700) after the Middle Ages and the Renaissance when many discoveries were made. During this time, new ideas and discoveries fundamentally changed the way people thought. They started what is called science today. Better printing presses after Gutenberg's time caused a great rise in publishing. This period roughly lasted from the 16th to the 18th century. 

Galileo Galilei invented kinematics and disproved Aristotle's old theory of gravity. One of his students said he dropped two balls of iron (one weighing one pound, the other a hundred) off the leaning tower of Pisa. The objects fell at the same speed which brought about new methods of thinking. In 1542, Nicolaus Copernicus published his work "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres", in which he said that not the Earth, but the Sun was at the center of the universe. This theory is known as Heliocentrism today. In the same year, Andreas Vesalius published his work "On the Structure of the Human Body". This book is about the anatomy of the human body. 

The philosopher Alexandre Koyré (18921964) first used the term 'scientific revolution' for this time period.

Rotten Tomatoes gave "Bullet to the Head" a 47% rating. Metacritic gave the movie a 48 score, meaning "mixed or average reviews". Jay Weissberg of "Variety" magazine called it a "kickass actioner driven by personality rather than plot."

"Bullet to the Head" was Stallone's worst opening weekend box office in 32 years. The movie only took in almost $22 million, failing to bring back its $55 million budget.

Stallone was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor in this movie.

Small shelly fossils

Small shelly fossils (SSF), or small shelly fauna, are tiny fossils, many only a few millimetres long. They have a record from the latest stages of the Ediacaran to the early Cambrian period. Almost all are from earlier rocks than more familiar fossils such as trilobites. Most SSFs were preserved by being covered quickly with phosphate. This method of preservation is mainly limited to the later Ediacaran and early Cambrian periods, so the animals that made them may have arisen earlier and continued after this time.

Some of the fossils represent the entire skeletons of small organisms, including the mysterious "Cloudina" and some snail-like molluscs. However, the bulk of the fossils are fragments or parts of larger organisms, including sponges, molluscs, slug-like halkieriids, brachiopods, echinoderms, and onychophoran-like organisms that may have been close to the ancestors of arthropods.

One of the early explanations for the appearance of the SSFs – and the evolution of mineralized skeletons – is a sudden increase in the ocean's concentration of calcium. However, many SSFs are made of other minerals, such as silica. The first SSFs appear around the same time as organisms first started burrowing to avoid predation, so it is likely that they represent early steps in an evolutionary arms race between predators and increasingly well-defended prey. Nevertheless, it is still true that the animals used minerals that were most easily accessible.

The small size and (usually) broken nature of SSFs makes them difficult to identify and classify. However, they provide evidence for how the main groups of marine invertebrates evolved, and for the pace and pattern of evolution in the Cambrian explosion. They include the earliest known representatives of some modern phyla, and they have the great advantage of presenting a nearly continuous record of early Cambrian organisms whose bodies include hard parts.

Friend of Dorothy

In gay slang, a "friend of Dorothy" (occasionally abbreviated FOD) is a term for a gay man. The phrase dates back to at least World War II, when homosexual acts were illegal in the United States. Stating that, or asking if, someone was a "friend of Dorothy" was a euphemism used for discussing sexual orientation without others knowing its meaning.

The origin of the phrase is most commonly attributed to the movie, "The Wizard of Oz" because Judy Garland, who starred as the main character Dorothy, is a gay icon. In the film, Dorothy is accepting of those who are different. For example the "gentle lion" living a lie, "I'm afraid there's no denyin', I'm just a dandy lion." Others claim that the phrase refers to celebrated humorist and critic Dorothy Parker, who included some gay men in her famous social circle.

In the early 1980s, the Naval Investigative Service was investigating homosexuality in the Chicago area. Agents discovered that gay men sometimes referred to themselves as "friends of Dorothy." Unaware of the historical meaning of the term, the NIS believed that a woman named Dorothy was at the center of a massive ring of homosexual military personnel. The NIS launched an enormous hunt for Dorothy, hoping to find her and convince her to reveal the names of gay servicemembers.




I Could Go On Singing

I Could Go On Singing is a 1963 movie starring Judy Garland and Dirk Bogarde. It was Garland's last movie. It was not a huge box office success, but it won Garland much praise for her performance. In Bogarde's autobiographies and in the 2004 biography, it is written that Judy Garland's lines were substantially rewritten by Bogarde (with Garland's consent).

Judy Garland plays a superstar singer named Jenny Bowman. She had met a man 15–16 years before. He is now a prominent physician, played by British actor Dirk Bogarde. They had a child whom she let his father raise in England. Jenny wants to finally see him, but in the end is left to her true home, the stage. Originally titled "The Lonely Stage", it was renamed "I Could Go On Singing", so that audiences would know it was the first time Garland sang in a movie since "A Star Is Born" in 1954.


All songs performed by Judy Garland.


"Either you are or you aren't - a Judy Garland fan that is. And if you aren't, forget about her new movie, "I Could Go On Singing", and leave the discussion to us devotees. You'll see her in close-up...in beautiful, glowing Technicolor and striking staging in a vibrant, vital performance that gets to the essence of her mystique as a superb entertainer. Miss Garland is - as always - real, the voice throbbing, the eyes aglow, the delicate features yielding to the demands of the years - the legs still long and lovely. Certainly the role of a top-rank singer beset by the loneliness and emotional hungers of her personal life is not an alien one to her..."
- "Judith Crist", "The New York Herald Tribune"

"3 stars...Judy Garland is back on screen in a role that might have been custom-tailored for her particular talents. A new song, "I Could Go On Singing", provides her with a little clowning, a chance to be gay, a time for wistfulness, an occasion for tears. She and Dirk Bogarde play wonderfully well together, even though the script itself insists on their being mismatched..."
- "Dorothy Masters", "The New York Daily News"

It was released on video in 1989, and on DVD in 2004. The soundtrack album was released at the time of the original movie release, and appeared on CD in 2002 along with the Garland album "That's Entertainment!"

National Liberation Front (Algeria)

The National Liberation Front (French: "Front de Libération Nationale" FLN), is a nationalist, socialist political party in Algeria. It was formed on 1 November 1954, by several smaller groups, initially as a liberation movement, driven by anti-colonial ideology. It gained independence from France after the Algerian War. After independence in 1962, the FLN became the sole political party, and Algeria became a one-party state until in 1989 other parties were allowed to take part in elections. 

The FLN was created on 1 November 1954, yet its origins can be seen as far back as World War II when the rise of anti-colonialism and Algerian nationalist rhetoric began. It was founded to reconcile factions within the Algerian nationalist movement and to remove France as a colonial presence. By 1956 nearly all Algerian nationalist organizations had joined, led by the Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action (French: "Comité Révolutionnaire d’Unité et d’Action"), the FLN had established itself as Algeria's main nationalist group.

The Algerian War was launched in 1954, as the FLN led forces with their military division, the National Liberation Army, against French occupation. The National Liberation Army used predominantly guerrilla warfare, which characterized this period for the group. In 1962 the FLN entered talks with the French President Charles de Gaulle, concluding with the signing of the Evian Accords, which led to Algerian independence

The revolutionary party identified with an anti-colonial ideology that wished to gain independence from previous imperial powers. The FLN used ideology as a means to legitimize their party, they gained support from citizens who might not otherwise have supported the political goals of the party. Furthermore, the FLN had a nationalist and socialist ideology (which is also why it is considered a nationalist/socialist party) for several reasons. Oftentimes, when countries fight for independence, their movement is led by nationalists, as nationalism causes citizens to want to break free from their colonizers. The FLN's ideology not only legitimized their actions but also created a sense of solidarity and identity among Algerians. Also, the FLN created a sort of bridge between Algeria and other nations that were fighting colonialism. 
Post-war Algeria's government had a nationalistic extremist ideology. Ironically, much of the left in France supported the regime associated with this ideology. The FLN was declining in February 1989 when the country implemented a new constitution. The new constitution lead to the end of Algeria's socialism and its corresponding one-party system.

Algeria gained sovereignty over its political future concerning France after a referendum that was held on 8 January, 1961. Following the referenda, the French Government and the FLN had several negotiations between 7 and 18 March of the following year. The negotiations led to an ending of the armed conflict between France and FLN-led Algeria on 19 March, 1962. The ending came about after a common agreement of cooperation between the two states.

Australian Convict Sites

"Australian Convict Sites" is a World Heritage Site which includes the remains of 11 places used in the transportation of convicts to Australia. This was a plan by the British government to move thousands of prisoners from England to Australia. It started with the sending of the First Fleet to Sydney in 1788 and continued for about eighty years. The Australian Convict Sites include places in Sydney, Tasmania, Norfolk Island, and Fremantle. These show:
" .. the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts."
All the sites were all individually included on the Australian National Heritage List before being put on the World Heritage list in 2010.

The two parks are managed together by the National Park Service.

The park is famous for its giant sequoia trees. One of these trees is the General Sherman tree, one of the biggest trees on Earth. The General Sherman tree is in the Giant Forest, which has five of the ten biggest trees in the world.


Summer Stock

Summer Stock is a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical movie. It was made in 1950. The movie was directed by Charles Walters and stars Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Eddie Bracken, Gloria DeHaven, Marjorie Main and Phil Silvers. Nicholas Castle Sr. was the choreographer.

Judy Garland struggled with many personal problems during filming, and "Summer Stock" was her last MGM movie. It was also her last pairing with Gene Kelly onscreen. MGM terminated Garland's contract - by mutual agreement - in September 1950.

Jane Falbury (Garland) is a farm owner. Her actress sister Abigail (DeHaven) arrives at the farm with her theater troupe. They need a practice stage, and Jane and her housekeeper Esme (Main) reluctantly agree to let them use their barn. The actors and actresses, including the director Joe Ross (Kelly), repay her hospitality by doing chores around the farm. Although Joe is engaged to Abigail, he begins to fall in love with Jane after Abigail leaves him in an angry fit. Jane is engaged to Orville (Bracken), but falls in love with Joe. The movie ends with a spectacular show in the barn itself, with the new leading lady, Jane.

All songs were written by Harry Warren (music) and Mack Gordon (lyrics) except where noted. Orchestration chores were divided between Conrad Salinger and Skip Martin.


Shooting this movie was sometimes a struggle for Garland. She was coping with many pressures in her personal life, including a heavy reliance on prescription medication.

Audiences noticed that in the last number "Get Happy" she appears thinner than in the rest of the movie. Before shooting the number, she had taken two months off and lost between 15-20 pounds. Garland finished the movie, and embarked on a long promised vacation from the studio. Soon, however, she was called back to star with Fred Astaire in the upcoming movie "Royal Wedding". Once again, Garland struggled to perform at her absolute best in the face of exhaustion and overwork. She was fired from the movie, and her contract with MGM was terminated through mutual agreement. Even though "Summer Stock" took six months to film, it was a box-office success.

The film's most famous scene is the final song-and-dance number "Get Happy" performed by Judy Garland in a tuxedo jacket, black fedora, and black nylons to an arrangement by Skip Martin. This sequence was choreographed by Charles Walters and filmed two months after the rest of the movie, after Garland sought the help of a hypnotist in Santa Barbara and lost 20 pounds. With the sedative-hypnotic paraldahyde reportedly on her breath, which the number's male dancers described as sickeningly sweet, Garland performed the number perfectly in just a couple of takes, and the rest is history. According to "New York Times" critic Bosley Crowther: " 'Get Happy' finds Miss Garland looking and performing her best."

In another notable sequence, Kelly performs a solo dance in a darkened barn, using a newspaper and a creaky board as partners and props; the musical accompaniment reprises "You Wonderful You". The dance "turned out to be one of the breakthrough numbers" of his career.

Greater Blue Mountains Area

The Greater Blue Mountains Area is a World Heritage Site in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. It was added to the World Heritage List at meeting of the World Heritage Committee, held in Cairns in November 2000.

This area is one of rugged tablelands, cliffs, deep valleys and rivers and lakes. There are many rare and different plants and animals which tell the story of Australia's great age. It shows the story of the evolution of Australia's unique eucalypt trees and the other plants and animals which live among them.

The Greater Blue Mountains Area covers about 10,300 square kilometres. It is mainly forest on a sandstone plateau 60 to 180 kilometres inland from central Sydney. The area includes large areas of wilderness and is about one third the size of Belgium, or twice the size of Brunei.

The Blue Mountains are a blue color. This is because rising air temperature makes the oil of Eucalypts evaporate into the air. This makes the mountains seem bluish.

The World Heritage Site includes eight protected areas. These are in two main blocks separated by land set aside for transport and housing. These areas are the:

The Blue Mountains are not really mountains, but a sandstone plateau rising from less than 100 metres above sea level to 1300 metres at the highest point. The plateau is cut through with deep valleys. There are basalt outcrops on the higher ridges. There are many different plants and animals which probably survived because they found shelter from climatic changes during recent geological history. 

The area is famous for its many different eucalypt habitats, from wet and dry sclerophyll grasslands, mallee heathlands, as well as swamps and wetlands. There are 91 species of eucalypts, 13% of all eucalypts, in the Greater Blue Mountains Area. Of these, 12 only grow here.

The area has been described as a natural laboratory for studying the evolution of the eucalypts. This is because there are so many of the different types growing in the Greater Blue Mountains Area. The area shows examples of how the eucalypts have changed to grow in the different Australian environments. These vary from tall forests at the margins or rainforest in the deep valleys, through open forests and woodlands, to shrublands of stunted mallees on the exposed tablelands.

As well as the eucalypts, the Greater Blue Mountains Area also contains ancient, relict species of world wide importance. The most famous of these is the recently discovered Wollemi pine. This tree is a "living fossil" dating back to the age of the dinosaurs. Thought to have been extinct for millions of years, the few surviving trees of this ancient species are known only from three small groups located in remote valleys within the area. The Wollemi pine is one of the world's rarest species.


More than 400 different kinds of animals live within the valleys and tablelands of the Greater Blue Mountains Area. These include threatened or rare species such as the tiger quoll, the koala, the yellow-bellied glider and the long-nosed potoroo. There are also rare reptiles and amphibians including the green and golden bell frog and the Blue Mountain water skink.

The largest predator of the area is the dingo. These wild dogs hunt for grey kangaroos and other prey.

The Greater Blue Mountains Area has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). It has many of the world's rockwarblers, as well as flame robins, diamond firetails and pilotbirds. The endangered regent honeyeater is seen there regularly. It is also a migration bottleneck for yellow-faced honeyeaters.

The Greater Blue Mountains Area was listed as a World Heritage Area by UNESCO on 29 November 2000. It was the fourth area in New South Wales to be listed. 

The reason why this site was chosen to be included on the World Heritage list is quoted below:

Charity is the act of giving help to those in need of it. It is a humanitarian act. It involves giving money, goods or time and effort to those who need it. It is done without expecting something in return. Giving money or food to poor people is an example of charity. Poor, sick or injured people are generally considered the proper people to whom charity should be given. When such people are not supported, they often begin begging, which is directly asking for help from people they do not know. Others may rely on support from charitable organizations. These organizations collect money and goods and then give them to those in need.

Most charities are concerned with providing basic needs, such as food, water, clothing, health care and shelter. The most common form of charity is donating money. The money is then used to buy these basic needs. However, there are many other actions that may be performed as charity, such as teaching orphans, donating blood, or money to help fund medical research.

Charitable giving can be a responsibility in many religions. This kind of charity is called almsgiving or alms. The word "charity" comes from the Latin "caritas" meaning Christian love. In Islam, it is called "zakat". It is one of the five most important duties of being a Muslim, and in Judaism it is "tzedakah".


Daphnia

Daphnia are small, planktonic crustaceans, between 0.2 and 5 mm in length. "Daphnia" are members of the order Cladocera. They are one of the several small aquatic crustaceans often called water fleas because of their jumpy swimming style. They live in various aquatic environments ranging from acidic swamps to freshwater lakes, ponds, streams and rivers.

"Daphnia" have open circulatory systems. Instead of having blood vessels, the daphnia have a fluid called haemolymph. The haemolymph is pumped throughout the body cavity (which is called a haemocoel).

The "Daphnia"’s nervous system consists of a brain that has two or three pairs of ganglia. Ganglia are nerve cells that tend to cluster up. The nervous system also has nerve rings that go round the oesophagus. Last of all, it has a paired ventral nerve cord.

The "Daphnia" reproductive system is parthenogenetic. The female daphnia produce eggs without mating. That means that their eggs can grow without being fertilized. The female daphnia carries its 50 or so eggs in the brood chamber, until they are ready to hatch. "Daphnia" can still mate, the only difference is that the “mated” eggs have an extra hard shell that can protect them from harsh conditions for a long time. These eggs are called cysts, and they can hatch when conditions are favorable again, which is usually around spring.

"Daphnia" spp. are a popular live food in tropical and marine fish keeping.

From each according to his ability, to each according to his need

From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs (or need) is a slogan that Karl Marx made popular in his writing "Critique of the Gotha program", published in 1875. The German original is "Jeder nach seinen Fähigkeiten, jedem nach seinen Bedürfnissen". According to Marx, once a communist society has been established, it will produce enough goods and services so that everyone's needs can be satisfied.

Even though the phrase is commonly attributed to Marx, he was not the first to use it. The slogan was common within the socialist movement. Louis Blanc first used it in 1839, in "The organization of work". The origin of this phrasing has also been attributed to the French communist Étienne-Gabriel Morelly, who proposed in his 1755 "Code of Nature" "Sacred and Fundamental Laws that would tear out the roots of vice and of all the evils of a society" including the following:

Eight years after Harvey Dent's death and the defeat of the Joker, the Dent Act grants the Gotham City Police Department the ability to easily prosecute organized crime. Feeling guilty for covering up Dent's crimes, Police Commissioner James Gordon writes a resignation speech telling the truth, but decides not to reveal the truth because it was not the right time. Batman has disappeared, with Bruce Wayne becoming an outcast. Cat burglar Selina Kyle steals Bruce's fingerprints from his home, kidnaps a congressman, then disappears. Selina hands Bruce's fingerprints to Phillip Stryver, an assistant to Bruce's business rival John Daggett, in hope of having her criminal record erased. Stryver double crosses Selina, but she uses the congressman's stolen phone to alert the police of their location. Gordon and the police arrive to find the congressman, then chase the criminals into the sewers while Selina escapes. A masked man called Bane who had escaped from a hijacked CIA Plane captures Gordon. Gordon escapes, and is found by John Blake, a patrol officer who grew up as an orphan and has known Batman's true identity from their similar backgrounds. Gordon promotes Blake to detective, with Blake reporting directly to him.
Wayne Enterprises is on the point of becoming bankrupt after Bruce wasted almost all of the companies money on a fusion reactor project when he learns that the core could be weaponized. Later, Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange, using Bruce's fingerprints to bankrupt Wayne Enterprises. Alfred Pennyworth, concerned that Bruce has not moved on from being Batman, reveals to him that Rachel Dawes had intended to marry Dent before she died, and resigns in an attempt to dissuade him. Fearing that Daggett, Bane's employer, would gain access to the reactor, Bruce and Lucius Fox asks board member Miranda Tate to take over his company. Bane later kills Daggett. After being promised to erase her records, Selina agrees to take Batman to Bane, but instead betrays him to a trap. Bane appears and reveals that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham with the League of Shadows. He breaks Batman's back and takes him to a foreign, well-like prison where escape is impossible. The inmates tell Bruce the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, born in the prison and cared for by a fellow prisoner before escaping, the only prisoner to have ever done so; Bruce thinks the child is Bane.
Meanwhile, Bane had kidnapped Fox, Tate, and Fredricks in order to turn on the bomb. While in the stadium, Bane triggers bombs under Gotham that causes the tunnels to collapse and traps most of the Gotham's police underground. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces an abducted physicist, Dr. Leonid Pavel, to convert the reactor core into a nuclear bomb before killing him. Bane uses the bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Prison, causing a revolution. The wealthy and powerful have their property destroyed or taken, are dragged from their homes, and given show trials presided over by Dr. Jonathan Crane, where any sentence likely means death.
After months of recovery and re-training, Bruce escapes from the prison; thanks to the prison doctor, and enlists Selina, Blake, Tate, Gordon, and Fox to help stop the bomb's detonation. While the police and Bane's forces fight at Gotham City Hall, Batman defeats Bane, but Tate later stabs Batman, revealing herself to be Talia, Ra's al Ghul's child, who escaped the prison thanks by her fellow prisoner, Bane. She plans to complete her father's work by activating the bomb and destroying Gotham, but Gordon blocks her signal, which makes the remote of detonation useless. Talia, then leaves to find the bomb. Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Selina kills Bane using the Batpod. Batman pursues Talia with the Bat, an aircraft created by Fox, to bring the bomb back to the reactor, where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely destroys the reactor before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses The Bat to haul the bomb over the bay, where it detonates.
In the months after, Batman is thought to be dead but is honored a hero. With Bruce also presumed dead, Wayne Manor is left to the city to become an orphanage, and Wayne's remaining estate is left to Alfred.

Refining

Refining is the name for a number of processes that purify or concentrate a substance. The name is used for natural resources, food and technical products. The place where this is done, is often called a refinery.
Petroleum contains hydrocarbons. After distillation, it still contains chemical compounds with sulfur, oxygen and Nitrogen as well as other unwanted compounds, such as Alkalenes. Processed petroleum is used for lubricants; the substances mentione are unwanted in lubricants as they can speed up the aging process. For this reason, they are extracted using a process called hydrogenation. In hydrogenation, Hydrogen sulfide and ammonia gases are produced. These gases require special handling, as they are very toxic.

Vegetable oils and fats are produced by chemical or mechanical extraction from plants. This produces a kind of oil that still has many unwanted substances, such as pigments and smell, which influence the quality of the refined product. In essence, the factors influenced are taste, shelf life, smell and color, as well as the ability to use the oil for further technical transformations. Depending on the process, between four and eight percent of usable vegetable oil is lost. There are two basic procedures to refine vegetable oil, chemical refining, and physical refining.

Sugar is washed, and treated with concentrated syrup. Its colored because most customers expect sugar to be white. The white sugar sold in shops in almost pure sucrose. It has an extent of 99,8 percent of its weight.

There are two basic processes to refine metals: Refining by fire, and refining by electrolysis. Higher grades of purity require both processes, lower grades use only the first process. 

Salt that is gained through evaportation of seawater needs to be cleaned; this is done by dissloving it in brine and then forcing it to crystallize. After the process, it is no lnoger possible to distinguish it from the salt extracted from rocks, by a mining process. Depending on the country, table salt for common use as a food additive may have iodine added. Sometimes Potassium fluoride is added as well.

American cheese

American cheese (also called a cheese slice or processed cheese) is a kind of pasteurized processed cheese. Usually, it has a mild taste. Originally, it was white, and made by mixing other kinds of cheese, most often cheddar cheese and Swiss. 

It is no longer produced by mixing existing kinds of cheeses, but by using a number of ingredients. In many countries, including the US, processed cheese is licensed differently to "real" cheese. American cheese may therefore not be sold as "cheese", but as "processed cheese". 

On the label, the word cheese is often left out, and the product is labeled "American slices", "slices" or similar. Since this kind of processed cheese is very common in the United States, it is often used to refer to all kinds of processed cheese. All the same, the term "American cheese" does have a legal definition in the American Code of Federal Regulations.

Lord Howe Island

Lord Howe Island is a small island about north east of Sydney. It is governed by New South Wales. About 70% of the island is part of the Lord Howe Island Group which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.

Islam in Iran

The Islamic conquest of Persia (637-651) led to the end of the Sassanid Empire and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. However, the achievements of the previous Persian civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic polity. Islam has been the official religion of Iran since then, except short duration after Mongol raid and establishment of Ilkhanate. Iran became an Islamic republic after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Before the Islamic conquest, the Persians had been mainly Zoroastrian, however, there were also large and thriving Christian and Jewish communities. Eastern Iran (what is now Afghanistan) was predominantly Buddhist. There was a slow but steady movement of the population toward Islam. When Islam was introduced to Iranians, the nobility and city-dwellers were the first to convert, Islam spread more slowly among the peasantry and the "dihqans", or landed gentry. By the late 11th century, the majority of Persians had become Muslim, at least nominally.

Though Iran is known today as a stronghold of the Shi'a Muslim faith, it did not become so until much later, around the 15th century. The Safavid dynasty made Shi'a Islam the official state religion in the early sixteenth century and aggressively proselytized on its behalf. It is also believed that by the mid-seventeenth century most people in Iran had become Shi'as, an affiliation that has continued. Over the following centuries, with the state-fostered rise of a Persian-based Shi'ite clergy, a synthesis was formed between Persian culture and Shi'ite Islam that marked each indelibly with the tincture of the other.

Nowadays Islam is the religion of 98% of Iranians, approximately 89% of Iranians are Shi'a and 10% are Sunni, mostly Turkomen, a minority of Arabs (mainly in Hormozgan Province), Baluchs, and Kurds living in the south, southeast, northeast and northwest. Almost all of Iranian Shi'as are Twelvers.

Jaú National Park

The Jaú National Park ('Parque Nacional do Jaú') is in the heart of the Amazon rainforest in the Amazonas state of Brazil. 

It is the largest forest reserve in South America, covering an area over 6 million acres (23,000 km²). Entry into the park is restricted; express permission from the Brazilian government is required to enter the reserve.

The park is a good example of tropical rainforest conservation in the Amazon. Its forests, lakes and channels are a "constantly evolving aquatic mosaic that is home to the largest array of electric fish in the world". The site protects key threatened species, including giant arapaima fish, the Amazonian manatee, the black caiman and two species of river dolphin and the jaguar. There are many other species of animals and plants.

The park is in the lower reaches of the Rio Negro branch of the Amazon. This branch is black with the organic matter picked up by the river. It has white-sand beaches during the dry season and flooded forest during the wet season. The streams turn into a 'ria' lake in the wet season, flooding huge areas of land, typical of all large rivers in the Amazon region. The site contains the nine-tier waterfall of the Carabinani River.

The Rio Negro flows through the eastern edge of Brazil’s Jau National Park. The river is the big strip of blue running from left to right across the image, and the other blue ribbons are tributaries. It starts at the border of Venezuela and Brazil, and meets up with the Amazon in central Brazil. Half-submerged islands can be seen in the center of the river. Between November and April when the river is at its peak, many of these islands disappear.

There is a high diversity of vertebrates in the park, with 120 species of mammals, 411 birds, 15 reptiles and 320 fishes. The site is home to relics of past human occupation of the Amazon region.

Lactarius torminosus

Lactarius torminosus, commonly known as the woolly milkcap or the bearded milkcap, is a mushroom in the genus "Lactarius".

"L. torminosus" associates with various trees, most commonly birch, and the mushrooms grow on the ground singly or in groups in mixed forests. Although it is valued for its peppery flavor and eaten after suitable preparation in Russia and Finland, it is highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins responsible for the acrid taste are destroyed by cooking.

The caps of "L. torminosus" mushrooms are convex with a central depression, and attain a diameter of up to . Its color is a blend of pink and ochre hues, sometimes with circular zones of darker shades. The edge of the cap is rolled inwards, and shaggy when young. On the underside of the caps are narrow flesh-colored gills crowded closely together. It is on these fertile gill surfaces that the spore-bearing cells, the basidia are found. The cylindrical stem is a pale flesh color with a downy surface, reaching a length of up to and a thickness of .

Island of stability

The chemical elements beyond lead are radioactive, and they do not have stable isotopes. This means that they will decay into other elements. As their atomic number (the number of protons in their nucleus) increases, the time it takes for them to decay tends to get shorter, going from billions of years to less than one millisecond. There is a theory in physics that says that after a number of elements with short half lives, there will be others with longer half lives. These are generally known as "islands of stability". These elements are expected to have isotopes that decay in several minutes.The theory is that, similarly to electron shells, the nucleus of an atom is made of "shells" (which can be thought of as layers of protons and neutrons), and that when a nucleus has entirely filled shells, it is significantly more stable. 

A filled shell would have "magic numbers" of neutrons and protons, known magic numbers are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126; however, further numbers are predicted to exist. One element that is predicted to be quite stable is unbihexium, in particular, its isotope unbihexium-310, which would be "doubly magic" (both its atomic number of 126 and neutron number of 184 are thought to be magic) and so would be the most likely to be very stable. The next lightest doubly magic isotope of an element is lead-208, the heaviest stable isotope of any element and the most stable heavy metal.

Isotopes have been produced with enough protons to put them on an island of stability but with too few neutrons. It is possible that these elements possess unusual properties and, if they have isotopes with long enough lifespans, would be available for various uses (such as particle accelerator targets and neutron sources).

Macquarie Island

Macquarie Island is a large island in the Southern Ocean. It is about south east of Tasmania, and about half way between Australia and Antarctica. The island became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. Macquarie Island is about long and wide. It was first discovered in July 1810, by Captain Hasselburgh, who was searching for places to hunt whales and seals. No people live there now. The only way to get to the island is by sea and there are no harbors to dock a ship.

The island was formed by two tectonic plates meeting and forcing each other upwards. "It is the only place on Earth where rocks from the Earth's mantle, below the ocean floor, are being pushed up above sea level". Confirmation is in this reference under section "Criterion (viii)".

Many birds and animals use Macquarie Island to breed. About 3.5 million seabirds and 80,000 elephant seals come to the island every year. Four types of penguins live on the island. There are about 850,000 royal penguins, 200,000 king penguins, 10,000 gentoo penguins, and rockhopper penguins with numbers thought to be between 20,000 and 1,000,000.

In 1977 Macquarie Island became a Biosphere Reserve. The coastal ecosystem is recognized as part of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme.

French colonial empire

The French colonial Empire (French: "Empire colonial français") was land controlled by the French from the 16th century to the late 1960s. In the 17th and 18th centuries France gained and lost large territories in North America and India. Like the other empires of the time, was powered by slaves captured from Africa. The Haitian Revolution, when many of these slaves in the colony of Saint Domingue fought and defeated the French, caused major changes in the empire.

Sometimes, people say there was a first and a second French colonial empire. The "First French Colonial Empire" was from the French colonization of the Americas to the Napoleonic Wars. The "Second French Colonial Empire" is the French colonies in Africa.

From the 16th to the 17th centuries, the First French colonial empire had a total area of over 10,000,000 square kilometres (3,900,000 sq mi), at its peak in 1680. At the time, it was the second-largest empire in the world, behind the Spanish Empire. In terms of land area, the Second French colonial empire extended to over 13,500,000 square kilometres (5,200,000 sq mi) at its peak in 1936. It was also the second largest in the world at the time, at 10% of the world's land area. The total land area of the first and second French colonial empire combined reached 24,000,000 square kilometres (9,300,000 sq mi).

France began to establish colonies in North America, the Caribbean and India in the 17th century, but lost most of them after losing in the Seven Years' War. The North American colonies were lost to Britain and Spain. Spain returned Louisiana (New France) to France in 1800. Then, France sold it to the United States in 1803. France rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850, mostly in Africa, but also in Indochina and in the South Pacific. It started to trade with the countries by supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items. Rebuilding an empire improved French reputation as an international power by spreading the French language and the Catholic religion. It also provided more men to fight in the World Wars.

A major goal was the "Civilizing Mission" (French: "Mission civilisatrice"). 'Civilizing' the populations of Africa by spreading language and religion was used to explain how the French colonial project worked. France sent small numbers of settlers to its empire, with the notable exception of Algeria, where the French settlers took power while being a minority.

Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine

The was a silver mine in the city of Ōda, Shimane Prefecture. It was the largest silver mine in Japanese history. Iwami Ginzan was active for almost four hundred years. It was discovered in 1526 and closed in 1923. 

Today the mine has become an open-air museum. It was named a World Heritage Site in 2007.

Kamiya Jutei, a Japanese merchant, started the mine in 1526. By the early 1600s the mine was producing approximately 38 tons of silver a year. That was one third of the world's production at that time. 

Warlords fought over the mine until the Tokugawa Shogunate took control of it in 1600 after the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Yamabuki Castle was built in the center of the complex. The mine produced less in the nineteenth century as it had trouble competing with other mines. It closed in 1923.

Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine was very important in East Asian trade because silver was the main currency. The silver mined at Iwami Ginzan was very high quality. From 17th century, coins made of the silver from the mine were not only one of the basic currencies in Japan but also used in the trade with China, Portugal and the Netherlands.

The Japanese Government named the mining town as a Special Preservation District for Groups of Historic Buildings in 1969. The government also applied for it to become a World Heritage Site. The application succeeded in July 2007, although the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOSMOS) did not find any "outstanding universal value" of the site.



Shrines and Temples of Nikkō

The site covers 103 buildings or structures and the natural area around them. Two Shinto shrines and one Buddhist temple are included in the site. 

The area of Nikko has been a Shinto forest since pre-historic times. It has had Buddhist temples since the 9th century. Thousands of Japanese cedars were planted in the early 17th century

The shrines and temples of Nikkō are closely related to the history of the Tokugawa Shoguns. 

In 1871, the Shinto areas and Buddhist areas were separated. Three sites were identified -- two Shinto shrine complexes and one Buddhist temple complex. 

After the "Law on the Preservation of Shrines and Temples" in 1897, Nikkō was protected by the Japanese government. 
Nikkō's shrines and temples were named a World Heritage Site in 1999.




In 2012, the World Heritage Site covers nine National Treasures of Japan and many "Important Cultural Properties".

Many gates and buildings at Nikkō have very detailed carvings. The use of color is based on records dating back to 1753. The very precise descriptions of the architectural structures
and the decorative works are used by experts who want to preserve history at Nikkō.


Wet Tropics of Queensland

The Wet Tropics of Queensland is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which has "the oldest continuously surviving tropical rainforests on Earth". The forests date from the Mesozoic era when the climate of Australia (and the world) was much more tropical than today. Originally, the rain forest area covered a much wider area than today. Today it is just a narrow strip along the east coast of Queensland. It starts just north of Townsville and continues to just south of Cooktown, a distance of about . 

The wet tropics cover an area of in 730 separate blocks of land. It includes 41 national parks covering. About 80% of the site is tropical rainforest. It is interesting because it is very old forest, and is a living record of 415 million years of evolution, going back to Pangea and Gondwana. All of Australia's marsupials, and many of its other animals, evolved in tropical rainforests, and many of their closest surviving ancestors still live in the Wet Tropics of Queensland.

The three vertical bars look of equal width but the centre yellow bar is slightly wider than the other two. The ratio of bar widths is 8:9:8. 

The look of the flag is from the flags of France and Spain.

The motto in the coat of arms in the middle stripe "Virtus Unita Fortior" means "Strength United is Stronger".

Important Cultural Properties of Japan

Japan's government made a Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties a to protect its culture. It chooses important items and names them as Cultural Properties The law sets rules about changing, repairing, or exporting these items.

There is also , which sets a lower level of protection and support for Registered Cultural Properties than for Designated Cultural Properties.

There are different levels of designation. Designation can be at a , or level.

Designations of a different level can coexist. For example, Sankei-en, a traditional Japanese-style garden in Naka Ward, Yokohama, owns both city designated and nationally designated Important Cultural Properties.

Coat of arms of Andorra

The coat of arms of Andorra has been used for centuries. Below the shield arms is Andorra's national motto ' (Latin for '). The coat of arms also appears on the Flag of Andorra.

Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha

Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha is a British Overseas Territory. It is in the South Atlantic Ocean and is made up of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the island group called Tristan da Cunha. In total, there are eight islands and the main is St Helena with a total area for the territory of .

It was known as Saint Helena and Dependencies until 1 September 2009. At that time a new constitution gave an equal status to all the islands in the territory.

Of volcanic origin, the islands of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha were all formerly separate colonies of the English crown, though separately discovered by several Portuguese explorers between 1502 and 1504.

Going to India, in May 1501, the Portuguese admiral João da Nova saw the Ascension island in the South Atlantic. On his return journey, Nova is said to have discovered the South Atlantic island of St Helena on 21 May 1502, the feast day of Helena of Constantinople.

Another Portuguese, Tristan da Cunha () discovered a group of islands in 1506 and gave its name to the principal island of the group () but it was soon changed to "Tristan da Cunha".

The Portuguese found that nobody was living in the St Helena island, with forests and fresh water. They built a timber chapel in the valley where later Jamestown was built.Though they formed no permanent settlement, the island became very important for ships coming from Asia and going back to Europe.

During the first years of the 16th century, the island of St Helena was used as a place to stop by the Portuguese, Dutch, English and French on their way to India and other Asian countries.

The Netherlands took St Helena from 1645 to 1659. In 1657, the English East India Company was given a permit to govern St Helena by Oliver Cromwell, and the following year the Company decided to colonise the island with farmers. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, and it is from this date that St Helena claims to be Britain’s second oldest (remaining) colony (after Bermuda). A fort was completed and a number of houses were built. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the East India Company received a Royal permit to start a colony in the island. The fort was named "James Fort" and the town "Jamestown", in honour of the Duke of York, later King James II of England.

In 1815, the British government decided to use the island of St. Helena as a place of detention for Napoleon Bonaparte. To prevent any attempt to escape from the nearby islands, they formally annexed the islands of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. In 1821, Napoleon died on the island of St Helena.

On 22 April 1834, the island of St Helena became a colony of the British crown. In 1922, the Ascension then was attached as a dependency followed by the Tristan da Cunha Island 12 January 1938 .

During the Second Boer War (1899-1902), the island of St. Helena served as camp for about 5,000 prisoners of war.

During the Second World War, the Ascension was leased to the United States who established a base for their airplanes.

In 1961, a volcanic eruption on Tristan da Cunha forced authorities to evacuate the entire population of the island to the United Kingdom. The people of Tristan da Cunha could not return to the island until 1963.

There is a huge distance between the northern and the southern points of the territory. The northern-most island, Ascension, is at latitude of the equator and the southern-most island, Gough Island is at . Between St Helena and Tristan da Cunha is the Tropic of Capricorn. The distance between the northern tip of Ascension Island and the southern tip of Gough Island is . The whole territory lies in the Western Hemisphere and has the same time zone: Greenwich Mean Time. Daylight saving time is not observed.

There are eight islands in the Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha territory:

Ascension has a warm, arid climate, but it is more moderated (and arid near the sea) in St Helena; Tristan da Cunha is much cooler. The highest point of the territory is Queen Mary's Peak on the island of Tristan da Cunha, with an elevation of above sea level.

Although all three parts of the territory were formed by volcanic activity, only the Tristan da Cunha group of islands are active at the moment.

Administratively, the territory is divided into the same three parts as the territory's geography, namely Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. Each is governed by a council. The Governor of the territory is the representative of the British monarch across the territory and presides over the St Helena Legislative Council, while he or she is represented by an Administrator on Ascension Island and an Administrator on Tristan da Cunha that preside over these two areas' Island Councils.

The island of St Helena is divided into eight districts.

With a population of 6,567 inhabitants in the census of 1998 (estimated to be 7,754 in 2013), the territory appears as one of the least populated British territory. The largest city of the territory is the capital, Jamestown, with a population of 1,000 in 2009.

Approximately 50% of the population are of African origin while the descendants of Europeans (British and Scandinavian) and Chinese each represent a quarter of the population.

The inhabitants are mostly Anglicans, but there are Baptists, Adventists and Catholics.

The islands had a very simple economy the mid-1960s, mainly based on the culture of New Zealand flax, a plant of the genus "Phormium", that was used to produce fibers and ropes. Agriculture is now mainly for food, except for a bit of coffee.

Fishing remains the only really important activity on the island, but the territory is almost entirely supported by the help from United Kingdom, particularly through the U.S. and British facilities in the Ascension Island, which employ about 25% of the population.

The tourism industry in St Helena is not well developed and is based on the fact that Napoleon lived and died here.

Rheumatoid arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a serious, painful, and chronic (long-lasting) disease. It is an autoimmune disease - a disease where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells. When a person has RA, their immune system attacks the joints and the tissues around the joints in the body. This causes different problems, like:

Eventually, RA can destroy a person's articular cartilage. Normally, articular (having to do with the joints) cartilage covers the end of bones where they come together to form joints. This keeps the bones from rubbing against each other. If the articular cartilage has been destroyed by RA, the bones will rub against each other, which is very painful.

No one knows what causes RA, but some theories are that it has to do with hormones, environment, infection and genes. There is no cure, but doctors have determined ways to help slow down and reduce the impact of the disease. Women are two to three times as likely as men to get rheumatoid arthritis. Most cases of RA occur in people between the ages of 25 and 55.

RA was first recognized around 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais.

Symptoms may include:

Often, people with RA also develop anemia, a different disease that causes a person to have not enough blood cells in the blood. 

Less often, a person with RA could have:

World Heritage Committee

The World Heritage Committee is the group which decides on the places to be listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It makes sure that the agreements in World Heritage Convention are followed. It also decides how the money in the World Heritage Fund is spent. The committee has 21 members who are elected from the 188 countries that have agreed to the World Heritage Convention.

According to the World Heritage Convention, committee members are elected for six years, however many of the representatives choose to be on the committee for only four years. This gives more countries a chance to take part. At the 15th General Assembly (2005) all the committee members agreed to serve for only four years.

The World Heritage Committee meets many times a year to discuss the management of existing World Heritage Sites, and to look at possible new sites. A special meeting, known as the World Heritage Committee Session, takes place each year where sites are added (inscribed) to the World Heritage List.

The annual session takes place in cities all over the world. With the exception of meetings held in Paris, where the UNESCO headquarter office is located, only countries who are members of the World Heritage Committee have the right to hold a Session. The cities are decided by the Committee.


Willandra Lakes Region

The Willandra Lakes Region is a World Heritage Site that covers 2,400 square kilometres in south-western New South Wales, Australia. It includes important natural and cultural features. The lakes were formed about two million years ago, but are now dry. The Australian Aborigines camped around the lakes, especially in the sand dunes on the lake shores for at least 50,000 years. These dunes are crescent shaped, and are called lunettes. The world's oldest cremation, of an woman more than 40,000 years ago, was found in a lunette at Lake Mungo. A small section of the region is protected by the Mungo National Park. As well as Lake Mungo, there is also Lake Mulurulu which was the last lake to hold water, the Prungle lakes which have been dry for more than 20,000 years, and Lake Chibnalwood which has a 30 metre high lunette, one of the biggest in the world.

The Willandra Lakes Region was added to the Australian National Heritage List in May 2007.




Sloth (deadly sin)

In Christianity, Sloth is about a person not wanting to work, because of their lack of motivation. The person will be physically inactive and neglect what God has said. Very often, this will lead to resources being wasted. As an example, sloth is about a person not helping those in need, even though they would be able to. Sloth is one of the seven capital sins, which are also called seven deadly sins.

For Protestants, Diligence (or hard work) is one of the ways to please God. Max Weber (1864-1920) treats this in his work The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. In his work "Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht", Immanuel Kant stated that of the capital sins sloth, cowardice and falsehood, the first one is the most despicable. However, he also sees this as a measure of self-protection of the individual, as long phases of hard work will lead a person to become tired, and to make short pauses between intervals of work. Without these pauses, the restless malice that is in the world would do a far greater amount of damage. In 1846, Louis Blanc wrote about the right to work. There was a financial crisis at the time, and many people were unemployed. The crisis led to the French Revolution of 1848.
In 1880, the Socialist Paul Lafargue published an essay called "The Right to be Lazy", where he explains that the worker should have a right to be lazy.

Ponte Buggianese

Ponte Buggianese is an Italian town in the province of Pistoia, Tuscany. About 8,876 people lived there as of 2011.

The Hardy Boys

The Hardy Boys are two American fictional teenage brothers and the main characters in a series of mystery books for children and teens launched in 1927. Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the book-packaging Stratemeyer Syndicate, created the concept, but the books were written by several ghostwriters over the years under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon. 

The series overview is simple. Frank and Joe Hardy are two high school boys in their late teens. They live in the fictional city of Bayport with their famous private detective father Fenton Hardy. The boys sometimes help their father with his cases, but, at other times, they find and solve their own. 

In 1959, the books were revised to eliminate objectionable material, and rewritten in a simpler style. New series were launched in 1987, 1997, and 2005. The original Hardy Boys Mystery Stories series ended in 2005. Some stories were adapted for television programs. Critics have offered many explanations for the Hardy Boys popularity including escapism, homosociality, and the triumph of good over evil.

The Hardy Boys are fictional teenage brothers and amateur detectives. They live in the fictional city of Bayport on the Atlantic Coast with their father, internationally famous private detective Fenton Hardy. The boys are in their late teens, have their own car, and are in the same grade in high school. Friends Chet Morton and Biff Hooper sometimes help the Hardys solve their cases. The boys have enough money to travel around the United States and even the world in pursuit of cases. Frank and Joe are very much alike, but "Frank was the thinker while Joe was more impulsive, and perhaps a little more athletic."

Edward Stratemeyer, founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, came up with the idea of mystery-solving brothers in 1926. Publishers Grosset & Dunlap approved the idea, and the name "The Hardy Boys" was chosen for the series. The books were written under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon, by ghostwriters who signed away their rights to authorship, pseudonyms, and future royalties. The first three books were published in 1927, and were an instant success. By mid-1929, over 115,000 books had been sold. The Stratemeyer Syndicate received all royalties, and their offices handled all correspondence. Public and school libraries agreed to keep the ghostwriters' names secret.
The earliest books are known for their atmosphere, detail, and clear writing style. Between 1938 to 1942 futuristic gadgetry and exotic locations were introduced to the series. The world in these early books is a dark and "divided place". Police and authority figures usually come off poorly; the rich are portrayed as greedy and selfish; and racial stereotypes abound. Parents complained and a revision project was undertaken in 1959. Texts were streamlined; stereotypes eliminated; plots were rewritten, lurid elements deleted, chapters per book were reduced, slang and difficult words were deleted, and the writing style was tightened. The revised versions focused on non-stop action rather than atmosphere and suspense, and were meant for a younger audience with short attention spans. Commentators thought the originals had been "gutted".

Thereafter, the books became more respectful of law and authority. Villains no longer smoked or drank, and scenes involving guns and shoot-outs were removed. The boys, too, become more respectful of rules and law: they drove within the speed limit, for example, even in pursuit of a villain. The Hardys became upscale and lost touch with the typical boy who bought their books. They became "members and agents of the adult ruling class, acting on behalf of that ruling class."

New series were launched in the last decades of the 20th century: the Hardy Boys Casefiles in 1987 and the Clues Brothers in 1997. The boys have distinct personalities and carry guns in the Casefiles series. The long-running Hardy Boys Mystery Stories series ended in 2005, and was replaced with "The Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers". In these books, the boys take turns narrating their adventures, and are given their cases by a secret group called American Teens Against Crime (ATAC). The Hardys were also featured in a graphic novel series (2005), and a chapter book series for early readers called The Hardy Boys: Secret Files (2010).

The Hardy Boys have been called "a cultural touchstone all over the world". The books have been translated into over 25 languages. The books have been continuously in print since 1927. The series was an instant success: by mid-1929 over 115,000 books had been sold, and as of 2008 the books were selling over a million copies a year. The first Hardy Boys book, "The Tower Treasure", sells over 100,000 copies a year. Worldwide, over 70 million copies of Hardy Books have been sold.

The longest-running series of books to feature the Hardy Boys is the Hardy Boys Mystery Stories, sometimes also called the Hardy Boys Mysteries. The series ran from 1927 to 2005 and comprises 190 books. Some consider only the first 58 volumes of this series to be part of the Hardy Boys canon. The Hardy Boys also appeared in 127 volumes of the Casefiles series and are the heroes of the Undercover Brothers series. The Hardy Boys are largely successful because their adventures represent "a victory over anxiety". The series teaches readers that "although the world can be an out-of-control place, good "can" triumph over evil, that the worst problems can be solved if we each do our share and our best to help others."







The various Hardy Boys series offer readers an escape from the everyday world into one of mystery and adventure with two self-controlled, gentlemanly, homosocial, idealized young white males who are the equals of their father (and other men) in intelligence and powers of deduction. Their ignorance of sex, their "squareness" (socially conventional), their respect for the law, and their homosociality have generated parodies such as "The Hardy Boys and the Mystery of Where Babies Come From", "The Secret of the Old Queen: A Hardy Boys Musical", and "A Ghost in the Closet: A Hardly Boys Mystery".

Vredefort crater

Vredefort crater is the largest "verified" impact crater on Earth. That means we know for certain it was caused by an asteroid or meteorite strike. The crater is in the Free State Province of South Africa. 

In 2005, the Vredefort Dome was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as a natural site of geologic interest.

The asteroid that hit Vredefort was one of the largest ever to strike Earth since the Hadean eon. The Vredefort hit was some two billion years ago. The bolide is thought to have been about 5–10 km (3–6 miles) in diameter. 

The crater has a diameter of roughly , larger than the Sudbury Basin and the Chicxulub crater. This makes Vredefort the largest known impact structure on Earth. If the Wilkes Land crater in Antarctica is an impact crater then it is the largest known at diameter.

The Vredefort crater's age is about two billion (10) years old, which puts it in the Palaeoproterozoic era. It is the second-oldest known crater on Earth, a little less than 300 million years younger than the Suavjärvi crater in Russia. In comparison, it is about 10% older than the Sudbury Basin impact (at 1.849 billion years).

It was originally thought that the crater was formed by a volcanic explosion, but in the mid 1990s evidence showed that it was the site of a huge bolide impact. Telltale shatter cones were discovered in the bed of the nearby Vaal River. 

The Vredefort crater site is one of the few multi-ringed impact craters on Earth, although they are more common elsewhere in the Solar System. Perhaps the best-known example is Valhalla crater on Jupiter's moon Callisto, although Earth's Moon has a number as well. Geological processes, such as erosion and plate tectonics, have removed most multi-ring craters on Earth.

The nearby Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC) and Witwatersrand Basin were created during this same period, leading to speculation that the bolide was big and fast enough to cause local volcanism. The BIC is where most of the world's known reserves of platinum group metals (PGMs) are found, while the Witwatersrand basin holds most of the known reserves of gold.

The Vredefort dome in the center of the crater is home to three towns: Parys, Vredefort and Koppies.

Chinese Crested Dog

The Chinese crested dog is a hairless dog breed. The breed probably did not actually come from China. It is the most common hairless dog breed. However, some of them do have fur. Other hairless dog breeds are the American Hairless Terrier, Mexican Hairless Dog, Peruvian Hairless Dog, and Hairless Khala. Hairless Chinese cresteds often win the World's Ugliest Dog Contest, which takes place every year in Petaluma, California.

The Chinese crested is a friendly, intelligent animal.

Universitat d'Andorra

The University of Andorra () is a public school of higher education. It was formed in 1997. It is the only university in Andorra. The university has a school of nursing, a school of management and computer science, and a center for online studies.

Telephone numbers in Andorra

Telephone numbers in Andorra are six digits, with fixed line numbers beginning with the digits 8 and 7 and mobile telephone numbers with the digits 3, 4 and 6.

Until 17 December 1994, Andorra was part of the French numbering plan, with the prefix 0628. Since 1994, Andorra has its own country code +376. 


List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita

This is a list of countries of the world sorted by their gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. GDP per capita is a measurement used to determine economic growth and potential increases in productivity and is calculated by taking the GDP and dividing it by the total population in the country. It is used to describe the standard of living of a population, with a higher gross domestic product per capita country ranking a higher standard of living is possible for its population. Although GDP per capita is an important and widely used indicator of countries’ level of economic welfare, "consumption per capita" may be more useful for comparing the relative welfare of consumers across various countries. GDP is the worth of all goods and services made in a country in a year. PPP is for purchasing power parity and it means how much money would be needed to buy the same item in two different countries. Per capita consumption is the yearly use of goods and services by each person. Per capita means per person.

List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita

The figures presented here do not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.

Therefore, these figures should be used with caution. GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living; however, this is problematic because GDP per capita .

Comparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. ("See" List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita.) PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.

Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo, Palestine and Taiwan) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in "italics".

Note that many of leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions, such as Ireland, are tax haven's. Their GDP data are subject to material distortion by the tax planning activities of foreign multinationals. To address this, in 2017 the Central Bank of Ireland created "Modified gross national income|modified GNI" (or GNI*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland.

All data are in current United States dollars.

"The table initially ranks each country or territory with their latest available estimates, and can be reranked by either of the sources"

Many of leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions are tax haven's whose economic data is artificially inflated by tax-driven corporate accounting entries.

For instance, the Irish GDP data above is subject to material distortion by the tax planning activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. To address this, in 2017 the Central Bank of Ireland created "Modified gross national income|modified GNI" (or GNI*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI*.

Varicose veins are a condition in which the veins in the leg area have become bigger. The condition not only looks bad, it also creates itching and painful problems.

Varicose veins are very common, affecting about 30% of people at some time in their lives. They become more common with age. Women develop varicose veins about twice as often as men. Varicose veins have been described throughout history and have been treated with surgery since at least A.D. 400.

Emblem of Angola

The Emblem of Angola is the national emblem. It shows the recent past of the new nation. There are Marxist pictures.

In the center is a machete and hoe. These show the revolution through which the nation gained independence, and the importance of agricultural workers. Above both emblems is a red star. The red star is often in many socialist images. The rising sun is the normal symbol of a new beginning. The half cog-wheel is for the industrial workers. The half vine of coffee and cotton leaves is for the coffee and cotton industry.

At the bottom is an open book that is for education. A banner reads "Republic of Angola" at the bottom, in Portuguese.

Riversleigh World Heritage Area

Riversleigh in north west Queensland, Australia, is one of the Australian Fossil Mammal Sites listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The other is the Naracoorte Caves National Park in South Australia. The Riversleigh site is part of the Boodjamulla National Park. The fossil site covers an area of about 100 km².

The fossils that have been found are the remains of ancient mammals, birds and reptiles of Oligocene and Miocene epochs. The site was listed as a World Heritage site in 1994. The fossils at Riversleigh are rare because they are found in soft freshwater limestone which has not been compressed. This means the animal remains retain their three dimensional shape.

Fossils at Riversleigh are found in limestone by lime-rich freshwater pools, and in caves. They are from when the ecosystem was evolving from rich rainforest to semi-arid grassland. Thirty-five fossil bat species have been found at the site, which is the richest in the world. A skull, complete with all its teeth, of a 15 million-year-old monotreme, "Obdurodon dicksoni", shows how this Australia group of animals evolved. Fossil ancestors of the extinct thylacine, "Thylacinus cynocephalus", have also been found at Riversleigh. In 1993, "Nimbadon" skulls were found in newly discovered cave. Scientists think this prehistoric marsupial first appeared about 15 million years ago and died out about 12 million years ago, perhaps from the effects of climate change. Other fossils have shown how the koala has changed in response to Australia's change from rainforest to drier eucalypt forests.





Kwikset

Kwikset is an American lock and door hardware manufacturer. Kwikset makes low to medium security residential and light commercial door locks. The Kwikset KW1 keyway is used by many other lock manufacturers. Kwikset recently introduced the SmartKey lock, which allows instant rekeying without removing the lock from the door, and without removing or replacing the core. The SmartKey lock uses the same KW1 key used in other Kwikset locks. The SmartKey lock is more difficult to pick than the standard Kwikset lock, although it is easier to force open.

Hiroshima Peace Memorial

Hiroshima Peace Memorial, also called the Atomic Bomb Dome or , is in central Hiroshima, Japan. It is part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. UNESCO named the dome a World Heritage Site in 1996. The dome is the ruined Hiroshima Prefectural Products Exhibition Hall. It was kept as a memorial to the people who were killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The bombing killed 70,000 people instantly, and another 70,000 died later from the radiation.

Czech architect Jan Letzel designed the building. It was completed in April 1915 and was named the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition. It was opened to the public in August that year. In 1921 the name was changed to the Hiroshima Prefectural Products Exhibition Hall. Finally in 1933, the name changed to the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. 

At 8:15 on August 6, 1945, the first atomic bomb to be used in war exploded almost directly above the dome. Everyone inside the building was killed instantly,but the building was not totally destroyed. There was more downward force on the building, but less side-to-side force right under the center of the explosion.

At first, the city planned to tear down the building, but did not because it was not as badly damaged. Some people wanted to remove the building, but others wanted to keep it. The city of Hiroshima was rebuilt around the ruined dome. In 1966 the city said that it planned to keep the building. As of July 2011, two construction projects kept the Dome from falling.

In December 1996, UNESCO added the A-Bomb Dome to the World Heritage List. Not everyone supported this decision. The United States did not join the decision. China said that the monument could take attention away from the countries that were victims of Japan during the war. Many more people died because of Japanese attacks in those countries. The United States said that having a memorial to a war site would not tell the whole history of the bombing.

Salmacis

In Greek mythology, Salmacis was a naiad nymph of a spring at Caria in Asia Minor. She didn't follow the other nymphs of the goddess Diana and united bodies with Hermaphroditus becoming a single being, both male and female.

""There dwelt a Nymph, not up for hunting or archery:"
"unfit for footraces. She the only Naiad not in Diana’s band."
"Often her sisters would say: “Pick up a javelin, or"
"bristling quiver, and interrupt your leisure for the chase!"
"But she would not pick up a javelin or arrows,"
"nor trade leisure for the chase."
"Instead she would bathe her beautiful limbs and tend to her hair,"
"with her waters as a mirror.""

Ovid, Metamorphoses. Book IV, 306-312.

According to Ovid's myth, she fell in love with Hermaphroditus, the son of Hermes and Aphrodite. When he bathed in her spring, she embraced him and prayed to the gods to be united with him forever, the gods heard her prayer and merged their bodies together, transforming Hermaphroditus into an androgynous being. Hermaphroditus then cursed the spring of Salmacis, so that any man who drank or bathed in its water would also become androgynous.

Historic Monuments and Sites of Hiraizumi

Historic Monuments and Sites of Hiraizumi is the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Hiraizumi in Iwate Prefecture, Japan.

The site covers 5 locations. Four of these places are Buddhist temples. The sacred Mount Kinkeisan is also included in the group The properties and their buffer zones are covered by a range of Japanese government protections as historic sites and places of scenic beauty.

Hiraizumi was an important political, military, commercial, and cultural centre from the late-11th century until the late 12th-century. This time was marked by the building and endowment of Buddhist temples, art and gardens.

Pure Land Buddhism developed a concept of planning and garden design that was unique to Japan.

The four Pure Land gardens of Hiraizumi show the ideals of Pure Land Buddhism. The gardens also show Japanese concepts about the relationship between gardens, water and the surrounding landscape.

The four gardens were developed by the Ōshū Fujiwara clan. The poet Matsuo Bashō was inspired by this Fujiwara legacy. In 1689, Bashō wrote: "Three generations of glory vanished in the space of a dream ..."

In 2011, UNESCO listed parts of Hiraizumi as a World Heritage Site.

Teenage pregnancy

Teenage pregnancy is a situation which involves female adolescents who are less than 20 years old. But sometimes preteens (people under 13) can become pregnant as well. The fact that teenagers become pregnant is related to many factors. These are related to the specific situation of the teenager and the group that she interacts with. The rates of teenage pregnancy vary from country to country and are related to differences of sexual activities, the general sex education and contraceptives being available. Teen pregnancy will sometimes involve low birth weight. Social matters also play a role: often, the teenager grew up in poverty. She also often has a lower level of general education. Pregnancy in teenagers in the developed world usually occurs outside of marriage. The lowest levels of teenage pregnancy are in Japan and South Korea. Teenage pregnancies are common among Romani people. Bulgaria and Romania have the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe.

Teenage pregnancies have a number of problems:

A large cause of teenage pregnancy is a lack of education about sex and pregnancy. The first to be blamed are schools and teachers, but the real starting point should be from within the family. Sometimes parents might think talking about sex is inappropriate or that it is automatically encouraging their children to have sex, so they avoid talking about it entirely. This leaves kids with information only from their peers, which often includes pressure to engage in sex acts to meet social standards. Parents should realize that in attempting to protect their children from the reality of human sexuality they are causing more harm than good. Open discussion about sex in a safe, nonjudgmental environment is essential to helping minors make educated decisions about sex. Pediatricians also take it upon themselves to make up for the information that has not been properly communicated to teens, and continually recognize better education as the key to helping reduce teen pregnancy.

Sudbury Basin

The Sudbury Basin is a major geologic structure in Ontario, Canada. It is the second-largest verified impact crater on Earth, as well as one of the oldest. 

The basin is on the Canadian Shield in the city of Greater Sudbury, Ontario. The Sudbury Basin is referred to locally as "The Valley". The urban core of the former city of Sudbury lies on the southern outskirts of the basin.

The Sudbury Basin is near a number of other geological structures. None of the structures are directly related to each other in the sense of coming from the same geophysical processes.

The Sudbury basin was formed by a strike from a bolide about in diameter. It occurred 1.849 billion years ago in the Palaeoproterozoic era.
Debris from the impact was scattered over an area of and traveled over away — rock fragments ejected by the impact have been found as far as Minnesota.

With such a large impact, debris was most likely scattered globally, but has since been worn away. Its present size is believed to be a smaller portion of a round crater that the bolide originally created.

Subsequent geological processes have deformed the crater into the current smaller oval shape. Sudbury Basin would then be the second-largest crater on Earth, after the Vredefort crater in South Africa, and larger than the Chicxulub crater in Yucatán, Mexico.

The full extent of the Sudbury Basin is long, wide and deep, although the modern ground surface is much shallower.

Ladbroke Grove rail crash

The Ladbroke Grove rail crash was a railway accident outside Paddington station, Ladbroke Grove, in London, England, on 5 October 1999, in the early morning. It involved two trains, one run by Thames Trains, the other by First Great Western.

A train run by Thames Trains left London Paddington railway station for Bedwyn in Wiltshire at 08:06am. 

It was a "Thames Turbo", painted in Network SouthEast colours and made up of three carriages. 

At Ladbroke Grove Junction, trains switched onto the usual route, one track for trains away from London, the other for trains to London. 

It should have stopped at a red signal and waited until it could do this safely, but it failed to stop at the signal (called a Signal Passed at Danger or SPAD). 

It collided nearly head on with a train run by First Great Western from Cheltenham Spa in Gloucestershire, after the signal that was changed failed to stop the train.

The train was a diesel high speed train, with 8 coaches and two locomotives, one at each end. 

The front two coaches of the Thames Turbo were completely destroyed, and the front locomotive of the High Speed Train was badly damaged. 

The diesel fuel in the Thames Turbo was scattered as a result and caught fire, which caused separate fires to burn in the wreckage, especially in Coach H of the high speed train which was completely burned by the fire. 

The drivers of both trains were killed in the crash. Altogether, 31 people died: 24 people on the Thames Turbo and 6 people on the high speed train were killed by the crash itself, while another person was killed by the fire. 523 people were injured, of which 227 were taken to hospital. The remaining 296 people were treated where the crash happened.

The immediate cause was the Thames Turbo failing to stop at a red signal at Ladbroke Grove Junction. A signal before it was amber, which should have prepared the driver for the red signal. Because the driver was killed, it was hard to find out why he did not stop at the signal. An inquiry was held in 2000 by Lord Cullen, one year later.

Lord Cullen took note of the fact that the railway line in London Paddington was prone to trains failing to stop at the same red signal that the Thames Turbo passed. 

One reason for the driver not stopping was that it was difficult for him to see the signal. It was very early in the morning and the sun was very low in the sky. This made the amber signal difficult to notice. Overhead power lines had been put up for the Heathrow Express to run, which obscured the signals even more.

The crash also happened shortly after the Thames Turbo driver had qualified, after his 2 weeks of training. The trainer did not tell him about the signal and later claimed that he was "not there to teach the routes" and was "totally there to teach how to drive a Turbo". Thames Trains also had no standardised test system for drivers, and no clear pass or fail criteria. The driver had been in the Navy and had little experience on the railways, and had qualified 13 days earlier than British Rail drivers did (British Rail also did not allow new drivers to drive on difficult routes such as the Great Western Main Line between London and Bristol, on which this accident happened, until they got experience on easier routes).

Another reason was that the Thames Turbo had been fitted with a safety system called ATP (automatic train protection), which would have stopped the train if it failed to stop at a red signal, but it was switched off. The High Speed Train's ATP was also off. Although it was recommended after a rail crash at Clapham Junction many years earlier, it had proved annoying in the past and no company required its trains to have it working and switched on.

On 5 April 2004, Thames Trains was fined £2 million for breaching Health & Safety laws in connection with the crash. 

On 31 October 2006, 7 years and 26 days after the crash, Network Rail pleaded guilty to charges under the Health & Safety at Work act 1974, was fined £4 million and ordered to pay a further £225,000. 

Both the front locomotive of the high speed train and the Thames Turbo were written off. The back carriage of the Thames Turbo, however, is now a spare part.

A memorial garden was created next to the Great Western main line near Paddington station, near the car park of a Sainsbury's supermarket.


Thames Trains

Thames Trains was a British train operator under franchise running a mixture of short and long distance trains around the Thames Valley. Its services were centered around Reading and ran in the area surrounded by Oxford, Gatwick Airport, Guildford, London, Basingstoke, Worcester, Hereford and Stratford-upon-Avon. It was started when British Rail was privatised and Network SouthEast was broken up. In 2004 it was replaced by First Great Western Link, which was merged with First Great Western and Wessex Trains after 2 years, forming a "Greater Western" franchise.

Thames Trains ran one of the Trains involved in the Ladbroke Grove Rail Crash in 1999, three years after it was started.

Freeport, Bahamas

Freeport is a city, district and free trade zone on the island of Grand Bahama. It is in North-west Bahamas. In 1955, Wallace Groves, a Virginian financier, was given 50,000 acres (or 202 km) of pineyard with swamp and scrubland areas by the Bahamian government. They were asked to develop the area economically. Freeport has grown and is now the second most populous city in the Bahamas. The main airport in Freeport is the Grand Bahama International Airport. The Grand Bahama Port Authority (GBPA) runs the free trade zone, under the Hawksbill Creek Agreement signed in August 1955. There, the Bahamian Government agreed that businesses in the Freeport area will pay no taxes before 2054. The area of the land grants has been increased to 138,000 acres (or 526 km).

Florida's Turnpike

Florida's Turnpike (TPK), designated as the Ronald Reagan Turnpike is a north–south toll road. It was originally called Sunshine State Parkway. The road runs through 11 counties in the Florida peninsula. It starts from U.S. Route 1 in Florida City, running through Miami, Fort Lauderdale. At West Palm Beach, it runs parallel to Interstate 95, and then in Orlando, it crosses Interstate 4, to its northern end at Interstate 75 near Wildwood.

The Turnpike itself has two sections. The first is the Mainline, a route from the Golden Glades Interchange (north of Miami) to Wildwood. This has the hidden designation of State Road 91 (SR 91). It was opened in stages between 1957 and 1964. The second is the long Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (HEFT). This was completed in 1974. Its hidden designation is State Road 821 (SR 821). This runs from Florida City (near Homestead) through the suburbs to the west and north of Miami, connecting to the Mainline four miles (6 km) north of the Golden Glades Interchange. Florida's Turnpike is considered one of the busiest highways in the country (according to the IBBTA, the highway is the nation's 3rd most heavily traveled toll road).

Hala'ib Triangle

The Hala'ib Triangle (مثلث حلايب in Arabic, transliterated Muthāllath Ḥalāʾib) is an area of land measuring located on the Red Sea's African coast. The area, which is named after the town of Hala'ib, is created by the difference in the Egypt–Sudan border between the "political boundary" set in 1899 by the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, which runs along the 22nd parallel north, and the "administrative boundary" set by the British in 1902, which gave an area of land north of the line to Sudan. When Sudan became independent in 1956, both Egypt and Sudan claimed sovereignty over the area. After Egypt sent military units to the Hala'ib Triangle in the 1990s, as part of a greater movement by the Egyptian government to solidify its presence in Africa, following the 1995 attempted assassination of then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Egypt has controlled the area as part of the Red Sea Governorate, and has been actively investing in it. Today the United Arab Emirates is also a active investor along with Egypt in the area.

The area is not shaped like a triangle—it is actually a complicated polygon. Only the southern border is a straight line. A smaller area, called Bir Tawil, touches the Hala'ib Triangle at its westernmost point. Bir Tawil is not claimed by either Sudan or Egypt.

Cesarean section

A Cesarean section (often called a C-section) is a kind of surgery, which is usually done to make childbirth easier. In the past, this was done when there was a great risk to the health of the mother, or when normal childbirth through the vagina was not possible. More recently, it has also been done on request, without these reasons. In very rare cases, abortions are performed using this procedure, these are called Hysterotomy abortions. The first person to perform a modern Cesarean section was Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer, in 1881. In Latin, it is called "Sectio caesarea", in English, the spelling Caesarean section also exists. 

The rate of babies delivered through Cesarean section varies: It is at a record level of 46% in China; levels of 25% and above are common in many Asian and European countries, Latin America, and the United States.

From about the 6th century, there was Roman law that stated that a living foetus may not be buried with the mother, The Digest notes this to be a "lex regia". If this were the case, it would date from the time around 700 BC, when there were Roman kings.

President of Angola

The President of the Republic of Angola is both head of state and head of government in Angola. The President picked a Prime Minister. Most of the decisions are made by the President.

Angola started having a President when they got independence from Portugal. Agostinho Neto was the first President.

In January 2010 the National Assembly decided the party with the most seats in the Assembly would become president. It was no longer a public vote. They also decided there would not be a Prime Minister. Instead the job will be done by the vice-president.

William John Swainson

William John Swainson, Fellow of the Linnean Society and Fellow of the Royal Society (8 October 1789 – 6 December 1855), was an English ornithologist, malacologist, entomologist and artist.

Swainson was born in Dover Place, St. Mary Newington, London. He was the eldest son of John Timothy Swainson, who was also of the Linnean Society. William worked at the Liverpool Customs when he was 14. He studied the ichthyology of western Sicily. In 1815, he returned to England because he became ill.

In 1816 he went with the explorer Henry Koster to Brazil. They did not spend a long time on shore because of a revolution. However, Swainson brought to England over 20,000 insects, 1,200 species of plants, drawings of 120 species of fish, and about 760 bird skins.

As with many Victorian scientists, Swainson was also a member of many societies. He was elected as a fellow to the Royal Society after his return from Brazil on 14 December 1820. In 1823, he married his first wife Mary Parkes, and had four sons and a daughter. His wife died in 1835.

Swainson re-married in 1840 to Ann Grasby, and emigrated to New Zealand in 1841. He died at Fern Grove, Lower Hutt, New Zealand, on 7 December 1855.

Many birds were named after William Swainson.

Angolan War of Independence

The Angolan War of Independence was from 1961 to 1975. Angola fought against Portugal. Portugal was making people in Angola farm cotton. Three different groups in Angola were against Portugal. Agostinho Neto was the leader of the war. Portugal was winning the war when the country's government became democratic. An agreement was signed to let Angola become independent.

About three thousand people died because of the war.

Monogamy

Monogamy (; "monos+gamos" meaning "one+marriage") is a form of marriage in which a person or animal has only one spouse at any one time.

The word "monogamy" comes from the Greek words "μονός", "monos" which means one or alone, and "γάμος", "gamos" which means marriage.

Monogamy is one of the beliefs of Judaism and Christianity. An exception is the fundamentalist branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) who strictly follow the teachings of founder Joseph Smith. Smith allowed polygamy, and had many wives. In Jewish and Christian doctrine, marriage is between one husband and one wife, which is monogamy.

In most countries, monogamy is the only legal form of marriage, either between a man and a woman in most of these countries, and between two persons of the same gender (gay marriage) in some of the Western world. 
In these countries polygamy is illegal, and a person who has more than one spouse can be prosecuted for bigamy.

Polygamy without equality was almost universal in ancient human tribes. By "without equality" is meant that of the wives only one would have full rights and recognition as the main wife.

The fact is that all societies of which we have good records lost men disproportionately, mainly because of warfare, but also accidents in hunting. This left widows who were not responsible for being widows: they were just unlucky.

It might be thought that this would be counter-balanced by loss of females during child-birth, but apparently not so. 
A full appreciation of this fact needs to take into account:

Angolan Civil War

The Angolan Civil War was a major civil war in the African country of Angola. It started in 1975 and continued until 2002. The war began right after Angola became independent from Portugal in November 1975. The Civil War was mostly a fight for power between two former liberation movements, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Other countries got involved in the war because they wanted their own ideologies to win. This made the Angolan war part of the Cold War. In 2002 the MPLA won.
About 500,000 people died in the war. The war also did a lot of damage to buildings in Angola. Because of all the damage, in 2003 80% of Angolans lacked access to basic medical care, 60% lacked access to water, and 30% of Angolan children would die before the age of 5, with an overall national life expectancy of less than 40 years of age.

With the cival war between 1975 to 2002 it was 27 years of fighting.

In 1575, the Portuguese started to colonize parts of what is now Angola. Before, some of the land was part of the Kingdom of Kongo.

The MPLA was a communist group fighting for Angolan independence. Its leader was Agostinho Neto. They were supported by the Soviet Union.

UNITA was an anti-communist group also fighting for Angolan independence. Its leader was Jonas Savimbi.

FNLA was another anti-communist independence group. Its leader was Holden Roberto. The US gave them money by funneling it through Zaire.

In 1975, Portugal signed the Alvor Agreement with MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA. The agreement said that Angola would become independent on 11 November 1975.

The war destroyed a lot of buildings in Angola.
There are still landmines remaining killing and hurting people.

Formicariidae

The Formicariidae or ground antbirds are a family of small passerine birds. They live in subtropical and tropical Central and South America. They are between 10 and 20 cm (4–8 in) in length.

These are forest birds that tend to eat insects at or near the ground. Many are specialist ant eaters. Note that the term "antbird" is for another family of birds, the Thamnophilidae.

Telephone numbers in Angola

Tyche

Tyche, also known as Tuch, was the goddess of destiny in Greek mythology. She controlled the good and bad of fortune and prosperity of a city. Her name means "luck" in Greek. She is often represented wearing a mural crown. The crown looks like the walls of a city. She is often carrying a large horn with all her wealth and richness in it that she sometimes spreads to others. She is a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, according to Greek poet Hesiod.

Tyche is one of the Oceanids. Oceanids are the daughters of the Titans Tethys and Okeanos. The story of the Oceanids is told in the Theogony by Greek poet Hesiod. Tyche and her sister Eudora stand for a joining of bounty and luck. 

Angolan kwanza

The kwanza (sign: Kz; ISO 4217 code: AOA) is the currency of Angola. The Kwanza was introduced in 1999, replacing the "Kwanza Reajustado" (AOK).  AOA is subdivided into coin denominations of 100 centimos, and is denoted by the symbol Kz.

Angola declared independence from Portugal in 1975, following a bitter period in which Angola fought a war of independence while also becoming engulfed in a civil war. While Angola created its first national currency as an independent nation in 1977, this currency—called the Angola Kwanza (AOK)—soon saw its value rapidly eroded by inflation. The AON, introduced in 1990, was an attempt to deal with this severe inflation, but it too was devalued only 5 years later.

The second devaluation occurred in 1995, when the AON was replaced by a new currency called the “kwanza reajustado”. The devaluation was carried out at a rate of 1,000 new currency units for every 1 AON, reflecting the level of severity of Angola’s inflation crisis at that time. A third devaluation occurred in 1999, replacing the kwanza reajustado with the Second Kwanza (AOA), which is the currency that Angola continues to use today.

Charles Sibley

Charles Gald Sibley (August 7, 1917 – April 12, 1998) was an American ornithologist and molecular biologist. He had a big influence on the scientific classification of birds.

Sibley's taxonomy was a major influence on many organizations, such as the American Ornithologists' Union.

Jon Edward Ahlquist

Jon Edward Ahlquist (born 27 July 1944, died 7 May 2020) is an American molecular biologist and ornithologist. He has worked with Charles Sibley, mostly at Yale University.
By 1987, both Ahlquist and Sibley had left Yale. In 1988, Ahlquist and Sibley were awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal. In January 1991 (often listed as 1990), Charles Sibley and Ahlquist published "Phylogeny and Classification of Birds", which presented a new phylogeny for birds based on the DNA. In 1999, Ahlquist was retired (Ahlquist, 1999).

Blue Thunder

Blue Thunder is a 1983 American action thriller movie. In it stars Roy Scheider and Daniel Stern as LAPD cops. The movie is about a futuristic helicopter which has unusual capability.

Honors music

The honors music is music played at formal times in the presence of the person, office-holder, or rank-holder. It is usually played by a military band. The head of state in many countries is honored with music. In some countries the national anthem is used. Some countries have a separate royal anthem or presidential anthem.

Countries where the national anthem is also the royal anthem include Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norfolk Island, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The Jamaican National Anthem is played for the Governor-General of Jamaica.

Countries with special honors music are:

Instances of honors music other than the relevant national anthem include the following:

Fair Antigua, We Salute Thee

"Fair Antigua, We Salute Thee" is the national anthem of Antigua and Barbuda. Novelle Hamilton Richards wrote the words. Walter Garnet Picart Chambers wrote the music. The country started using in on independence in 1981. God Save the Queen is still the Royal anthem.

Flag of Antigua and Barbuda

The national flag of Antigua and Barbuda was started on February 27, 1967. It was designed by artist and sculptor, Sir Reginald Samuel. The rising sun is for the dawning of a new era. The colours have different meanings. The black is for the African ancestry of the people. The blue is for hope. The red is for energy or dynamism of the people. The colouring of yellow, blue, and white (from the sun down) is for the sun, sea, and sand. The blue also is for the Caribbean Sea. The V-shape is the symbol of victory.

Priapus

Priapus was a minor fertility god in Greek mythology, who was also the protector of livestock, fruit plants, and male genitals. He was depicted as having an oversized and permanent erection. Sources differ as to who his parents were. Some say he was the son of the god Dionysus and the goddess Aphrodite; Dionysus and Chione; Hermes and Aphrodite; Zeus and Aphrodite; or Pan and Aphrodite. According to the myth, Hera cursed him while he was still in the womb of Aphrodite, because she was jealous that the Trojan prince Paris had picked Aphrodite as being the most beautiful of the goddesses and had given the Golden Apple of Eris to her. Hera's curse made Priapus impotent, ugly and foul-minded. The gods did not want Priapus to live with them on Olympus, and he was left on a hillside on Earth. There, he was taken by shepherds who raised him. Priapus later tried to rape the goddess Hestia, but was hit by a donkey, and this caused Priapus to lose his erection.
He also became the patron god of merchant sailing, protecting and guiding them through rough seas. It was common for merchants to carry a Priapus figure or a phallus on their ships as protection.

Planaria

Planaria is a small aquatic genus of flatworm. The term is also used for other similar flatworms. They are fresh water animals which move in a smooth wave-like manner. Planaria are free-living. They can live in fresh water or very damp soil, depending on the type. 

"Planaria" are hermaphrodite: they produce both eggs and sperm. To reproduce, a planarian releases eggs and sperm into the water, where the eggs get fertilized. Planaria can repair damage by regenerating any part of their body. 

"Planaria" are the one of most simple creatures to develop a nervous system. Their nervous system consists of ganglia under the eyespots and a cord of nerves that run down the body, under the gut (ventral nerve cord). The three pairs of ganglia under the eyespots make a inverted U shape that have nerves sticking out to the outside of the head so that the head of the planarian is more sensitive than the rest of the body. If the light hits the animal near the eyespots, they usually move away into darker water. 

The digestive system of "Planaria" consist of a mouth a pharynx and a gut cavity. Its mouth is on the underside of the body. Digestive enzymes are released from the mouth onto the food to soften it, Then the half digested food is sucked up the pharynx and into the stomach. From there the nutrients diffuse into the rest of the body. 

There are no circulatory or respiratory systems. Oxygen enters and carbon dioxide leaves the planarian's body by diffusing through the body wall. "Planaria" do not have a skeleton. They have an extendable crumpled muscle that allows them to move. Also, planarians have three layers of body-wall muscles that are constructed of circular muscle fibers as well as longer muscle threads.

Planarians have both ovaries and testes. To reproduce, they can have sex with another planarian; this is called sexual reproduction. Another way planarians reproduce is called asexual reproduction. This is when a planarian splits and regenerates the parts that are missing. However, asexual reproduction is uncommon.

Ironbridge Gorge

The Ironbridge Gorge is a deep gorge formed by the River Severn in Shropshire, England. The area was originally called the Severn Gorge.

The area was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, because the industrial revolution started around here in the mid-1700s.

Ironbridge Gorge has mines, factories, workers' housing, and the transport infrastructure that was created in the gorge during the Industrial Revolution. Coke production in the area helped start the Industrial Revolution. The Iron Bridge was the world's first bridge built from iron.

The gorge takes its name from its famous "Iron Bridge", the first iron bridge of its kind in the world. It is a monument to the industry that began there. The bridge was built in 1779 to link the industrial town of Broseley with the smaller mining town of Madeley and the growing industrial centre of Coalbrookdale.

The Iron Bridge was the first arch bridge in the world to be made out of cast iron. a material which was previously far too expensive to use for large structures. However, a new blast furnace nearby lowered the cost. This encouraged local engineers and architects to solve a long-standing problem of a crossing over the river.

There are two reasons the site was so useful to the early industrialists. The raw materials, coal, iron ore, limestone and clay, for the manufacture of iron, tiles and porcelain are exposed or easily mined in the gorge. Second, the deep and wide river allowed easy transport of products to the sea.


The Iron Bridge

The Iron Bridge was the first arch bridge in the world to be made out of cast iron. It crosses the River Severn at the Ironbridge Gorge near the village of Ironbridge, in Shropshire, England.

The bridge is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is maintained by English Heritage who launched a crowdfunding campaign in 2017 to support a conservation project which began in 2018. As well as repairing rusted parts of the bridge, it was painted red to match a painting from 1777 showing how the Iron Bridge looked soon after it was finished. 


Herma

A herma, commonly in English herm, is a sculpture with a head and sometimes a torso, above a tall squared pillar. Often a phallus was carved at the appropriate height. 

The form originated in Ancient Greece and was adopted by the Romans and revived in the Renaissance in the form of term figures. The name of the god Hermes comes from the word "herma", and the sculptures originally represented him.

The ancient Greeks and Romans were very superstitious, and the sculptures had an apotropiac function. They were placed at cross-roads and on the borders of lands as protection. 

In Athens, they were placed outside houses, temples and gymnasiums for good luck and to avert harmful or bad influences, like the evil eye. They would be adorned with garlands, wreaths, offerings and anointed with oil to obtain luck and protection.

26th of July Movement

The 26th of July Movement was the name of the political party led by Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution. In Spanish, it is called Movimiento 26 de Julio, it is often abbreviated M-26-7. The name comes from the date of the attack on the Moncada Barracks, in Santiago de Cuba, which was carried out on 26th July 1953. The participants were condemned to long prison terms, but were freed at an amnesty in 1955. After this, they formed the movement. Their strategy was armed resistance, in small cells, that were spread all over the country, and were kept secret. Frank País was made the leader of the resistance in Cuba, other activists were Raúl Pujol, Celia Sánchez, Haydée Santamaría, Aldo Santamaría and Vilma Espín.

Fidel castro and other Moncadistas went into exile. Castro went to Mexico, where he met Ernesto Guevara. In 1956, Fidel and Raul Castro, Juan Almeida Bosque, Ramiro Valdés Menéndez, Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos went back to Cuba to support the cells there. After two years of guerilla fighting, Fulgencio Batista fled from Cuba, in 1959. 

Until the fall of Batista, the forces did not have a Marxist ideology, rather they were different people collaborating to overturn the Batista regime. Later they started to work together with the Communist Party of Cuba. In 1961, they merged with the Communist Party.

Antiplatelet drug

An Antiplatelet drug is a drug that acts against blood clotting. The blood contains platelets, which will stick together, and close an open wound. In some cases, they also stick together in the bloodstream, and form blood clots. Such blood clots cause Strokes and Heart attacks. Another type of drug that prevents clotting is called anticoagulant. Anticoagulants cannot be used to prevent blood clotting in the arteries. Antiplatelet drugs are commonly used in the prevention of strokes and heart attacks. Acetylsalicylic acid, commonly known as Aspirin, is one of them. 

Charles Edward Trevelyan

Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet (2 April 1807 – 19 June 1886) was a British civil servant, cabinet member, colonial administrator, and oriental scholar best known for his administration of the famine relief effort in Ireland during the Potato Famine, while he was assistant secretary to Her Majesty's Treasury. He has been criticized for not doing enough to help the Irish during the Potato Famine. He wrote a book about the famine called "The Irish Crisis".

Some species in this genus are:



Coalbrookdale

Coalbrookdale is a village in the Ironbridge Gorge in Shropshire, England. It is in an area of great significance in the history of industrialisation. This is where iron ore was first smelted by Abraham Darby using easily mined "coking coal".

The coal was drawn from drift mines in the sides of the valley. As it contained far fewer impurities than normal coal, the iron it produced was of a superior quality. Along with many other industrial developments that were going on in other parts of the country, this discovery was a major factor in the growing industrialisation of Britain. It was the Industrial Revolution.

Today, Coalbrookdale is home to the Ironbridge Institute, a partnership between the University of Birmingham and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust offering postgraduate and professional courses in heritage.

Drosophila simulans

Drosophila simulans is a species of fruit fly closely related to "D. melanogaster" 

It was discovered by the fly geneticist Alfred Sturtevant in 1919, when he noticed that the flies used in Thomas Hunt Morgan's laboratory at the Columbia University were actually two distinct species: "D. melanogaster" and "D. simulans". Males differ in the external genitalia, while trained observers can separate females using colour characteristics. 

"D. melanogaster" females crossed to "D. simulans" males produce sterile F1 females and no F1 males. The reciprocal cross produces sterile F1 males and no female progeny.

"D. simulans" was found later to be closely related to two island endemics, "Drosophila sechellia" and "Drosophila mauritiana". "D. simulans" will mate with these sister species to form fertile females and sterile males, a fact that has made "D. simulans" an important model organism for research into speciation.



Nozomi (spacecraft)

Redonda

Redonda is a very small Caribbean island. It is part of Antigua and Barbuda. No people live here.

This small island is southwest of Antigua. It is between the islands of Nevis and Montserrat.

Redonda seems like one very large rock. It is what is left of an ancient volcanic core. The land rises very steeply from sea level, mostly as sheer cliffs. There is no source of freshwater except rain. The only animals that live here are seabirds and a herd of feral goats. The goats live on the poor grazing on top of the island.

Christopher Columbus found Redonda in 1493 on his second journey. He said the island belonged to Spain. He named the island "Santa María la Redonda", meaning Saint Mary the Round. The island looks round when viewed from the side. In the 1860s, the island became a British possession.

Shiretoko National Park

The word "Shiretoko" is comes from an Ainu word """". It means "end of the Earth".

Shiretoko National Park was established in 1964.

In 2005, UNESCO named the area a World Heritage Site. UNESCO also suggested that Japan should work with Russia to make an international "World Heritage Peace Park" including the Kuril Islands. Both Japan and Russia claim these islands as part of their countries.

Shiretoko is hard to get to. Visitors must go to most places on foot or by boat. There is a hot springs waterfall called . "" means "water of the gods" in Ainu.

The park forests are temperate and subalpine. There are several different types of trees. The most common trees here are Sakhalin fir, Erman's birch, and Mongolian oak.

The park has Japan's largest mammal species of Ezo brown bears.

Billy Tipton

"This is about the American musician. For other people called Tipton, see Tipton (disambiguation)."
Billy Lee Tipton (December 29, 1914 – January 21, 1989) was an American jazz musician and bandleader. Tipton had been assigned female gender at birth.
Tipton was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. His aunt raised him after his parents' divorced. He became interested in music in high school, especially jazz. He studied piano and saxophone. He went back to Oklahoma for his last year of high school and joined the school band there. His nickname in high school was "Tippy".

Tipton later took his father's nickname, Billy, when he started a music career. He also began to try to appear to be male by dressing to hide his breasts. At first, Tipton only behaved as a male while performing. However, by 1940 Tipton was living as a man all the time. Very few people knew both sides of his life. They were two of his female cousins and maybe his later lovers.

In 1936, Tipton lead a band playing on the radio station, KFXR. In 1938, Tipton joined Louvenie’s Western Swingbillies. This band played on another rado station, KTOK, and at Brown's Tavern. In 1940, Tipton was touring the Midwest and playing at dances with Scott Cameron's band. Starting in 1941, he played for two and a half years at Joplin, Missouri's Cotton Club with George Meyer's band. He then toured for a time with Ross Carlyle. Later, he played for two years in Texas.

In 1949, Tipton began touring the Pacific Northwest with George Meyer. A local radio station recorded the band's appearances at Roseburg, Oregon's Shalimar Room. Recordings of Tipton's early playing include "If I Knew Then" and "Sophisticated Swing". The band was well known for the song "Flying Home". They played the song like Benny Goodman's band did.

George Meyer's band became more successful, and they began getting better chances to perform. They played with The Ink Spots, the Delta Rhythm Boys, and Billy Eckstine at the Boulevard Club in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

Tipton began playing piano alone at the Elks club in Longview, Washington. In Longview, he started the Billy Tipton Trio. This band was Tipton on piano, Dick O'Neil on drums, and Kenny Richards (and later Ron Kilde) on bass. The trio became popular in the area.

A talent scout from Tops Records heard them play at King's Supper Club in Santa Barbara, California and got them a contract to record songs. The Billy Tipton Trio made two albums of jazz standards for Tops, "Sweet Georgia Brown" and "Billy Tipton Plays Hi-Fi on Piano", in 1957. The albums sold 17,678 copies. This was a good number for a small independent record label.

After the albums' success, the Holiday Hotel in Reno, Nevada asked them to become play there regularly. Tops Records asked the trio to record four more albums. Tipton said no both offers. Instead, he moved to Spokane, Washington worked as an agent. The trio played every week at Allen's Tin Pan Alley as the house band. He played mainly swing standards and less jazz, even though he preferred jazz. His performances also included skits like vaudeville performers did. He imitated celebrities like Liberace and Elvis Presley. In some of these comedy skits, he played a little girl. He helped young musicians at the Dave Sobol Theatrical Agency.

In the late 1970s, Tipton's arthritis got worse and he had to retire from music.

Early in his career, Tipton appeared as a male only as a musician. He appeared as a woman at other times. He lived with a woman named Non Earl Harrell. Other musicians thought this was a lesbian relationship. The relationship ended in 1942. Tipton's next relationship was with a singer known only as "June". This lasted for several years.

Then, or seven years, Tipton lived with a young woman named Betty Cox. She was 19 when they started their relationship. Cox said they had a heterosexual relationship. Betty remembered Tipton as "the most fantastic love of my life." Tipton kept the secret of his physical sexual characteristics a secret from Betty with a story. Tipton said that he had been in a serious car accident which had badly damaged his genitals and broken some ribs. He said he had to wear bandages protect his damaged chest. He told his female partners this story later in his life. Tipton was never legally married, but several women had drivers' licenses naming them Mrs. Tipton. 

In 1960, Tipton ended the relationship with Cox. He settle down with nightclub dancer and stripper, Kitty Kelly (later known as Kitty Oakes). Her professional name was "The Irish Venus." They were involved with their local PTA and with the Boy Scouts. They adopted three sons, John, Scott, and William. After Tipton died, Kitty gave several interviews about him and their relationship. In early interviews, she said, “He gave up everything... There were certain rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a musician.” She was taking about trying to be part of 1920−30s music industry. His son William described Tipton as a good father who loved to go on Scout camping trips.

They had trouble with their adopted sons during their adolescence. The couple often argued over how they should raise the boys. Tipton left Kitty in the late 1970s and moved into a mobile home with their sons. He restarted an old relationship with Maryann. He was poor, but stayed there until his death.

In 1989, at the age of 74, Tipton had medical problems. He said it was emphysema and refused to call a doctor. Actually he had a hemorrhaging peptic ulcer. He died because he did not get medical care for this serious problem. His son William watched while paramedics were trying to save Tipton's life. That is how William learned that his father was born female. Tipton was pronounced dead at Valley General Hospital. The coroner shared the secret with the rest of the family. Kitty had his body to be cremated so that nobody would find out, but one of their sons did not keep the secret. A newspaper article was published the day after Tipton's funeral and wire services picked it up. Stories about Tipton appeared in papers including tabloids such as "National Enquirer" and "Star", as well as more serious papers such as "New York Magazine" and "The Seattle Times". Tipton's family even made talk show appearances.

"Kill Me, Por Favor" is a short story including a section about Billy Tipton in Ry Cooder's 2011 volume entitled "Los Angeles Stories". Pub. City Lights Books 2011.




Hip replacement

Hip replacement is a surgery where the hip joint is replaced by a prosthetic implant. This joint replacement is usually done to relieve arthritis pain or fix very bad joint damage.

There are three types of hip replacement surgeries.


Your doctor may recommend a hip replacement if you have significant pain, swelling, and damage to your hip joint due to the following conditions:


Typically, after 6 to 12 weeks, you will make a full recovery from hip replacement surgery. You will still need follow-up appointments to make sure your hip is healing.

Most people can resume their daily activities after six weeks. You may be discharged from the hospital after 2 to 4 days. Here are some points that can help you speed up your recovery after surgery.

Arc flash

Arc flash is an accidental electrical explosion usually caused by a short circuit. It usually happens at higher-voltages (around 300 volts and above). It can cause the electrical conductors to melt creating an explosion of molten or even vaporized metal. Temperatures can be as high as 20000 degrees Celsius. Arc flash is one of the reasons it is so important to turn the power off before working on any high-voltage equipment.

Taurobolium

During the Roman empire, the taurobolium referred to practices involving the sacrifice of a bull, which after mid-2nd century became connected with the worship of the Great Mother of the Gods; though not previously limited to her cult, after 159 AD all private inscriptions mention "Magna Mater" (the Roman name for the goddess Cybele). Originating in Asia Minor, its earliest attested performance in Italy occurred in 134 AD.

At the taurobolium ritual, the high-priest would stand inside a pit made specifically for the purpose of the ritual, a bull would be led above the pit and sacrificed above him, the blood of the bull would pour down onto the priest, showering him in the blood. After this, the bulls testicles were removed and taken to the sanctuary as an offering. This ritual was done as a replacement for the castration of high-priests, this was because castration of male Roman citizens was forbidden in Rome.


Gary Thomasson

Gary Leah Thomasson (born July 29, 1951 in San Diego, California) is a former professional baseball player. He played as an outfielder and first baseman in Major League Baseball from 1972 to 1980 and in Japanese Nippon Pro Baseball from 1981 to 1982.

Thomasson got a lot of attention when he joined the Yomiuri Giants. He got the largest contract ever in the Nippon league. Then, Thomasson played poorly in his two years in Japan. He almost set the league record for strikeouts. He ended his career with a knee injury.

Japanese artist Genpei Akasegawa used Thomasson's name to describe a kind of found art. A ""Tomason"" is a part of a building that has lost its meaning or purpose, but still is still interesting.

Kangi

, also romanized as Kanki, was a after "Antei" and before "Jōei." This period started in March 1229 and ended in April 1232. The reigning emperor was .




Tenpuku

, also romanized as Tempuku, was a after "Jōei" and before "Bunryaku." This period started in April 1233 and ended in November 1234. The reigning emperor was .




Tomason

A , also spelled Thomason and Thomasson in English, is a kind of conceptual art or found art. Gempei Akasegawa created this word to describe certain kinds of useless parts of buildings or roads. These have lost their purpose as the environment around them changed. This kind of art is not made on purpose, but becomes art when people observe and recognize it.

Akasegawa named this special kind of "art" after an American baseball player who joined the Yomiuri Giants in 1981. Gary Thomasson became famous in Japan for getting the biggest baseball contract ever, then playing very poorly and retiring early.

Tomason can be grouped by features they have in common. These include: "useless stairways", "pointless doorways", "overhangs", "blocked windows", "sealed up walls", "A-bomb type", (doors opening from a high place into open air), "outies", "poundcakes", "atago" (strange bumps or things sticking up out of the road for no reason), "premature burial" (when a wall is built partly covering an existing feature), and more.


Mystery fiction

Mystery fiction (story, book, novel) is fictional work in which a professional or amateur detective investigates and solves a crime mystery. Usually the story begins with a crime and a few suspects, and ends when the protagonist detective identifies the criminal. 

Sometimes the term is used to refer to supernatural or suspense stories and thrillers. 


Nematode

The nematodes or roundworms are one of the most diverse of all animal phyla. They are one of the protostome phyla.

Nematode species look very similar to one another. Over 80,000 have been described, of which over 15,000 are parasitic. It has been estimated that the total number of described and undescribed roundworms might be more than 500,000.

The body structure is fairly constant. A thick cuticle gives protection, and acts as a kind of hydrostatic skeleton. "Caenorhabditis elegans" has had its genetics studied intensively, and it had its genome analysed in the year 1998. DNA sequence analysis of nematodes is quite advanced, including trees of species relationship.

Cell numbers in the organs are constant within a species. Nematodes have a fixed, genetically determined number of cells, a phenomenon known as eutely. The male "C. elegans" has 1031 cells, a number which does not change after cell division stops at the end of the larval period. Growth is solely due to an increase in the size of individual cells.


Bromance

A bromance is a close non-sexual relationship between two or more men, a form of homosocial intimacy. Bromance is a portmanteau word of "bro" or "brother" and "romance". The word was created in the 1990s to describe the sort of relationships that develop between skateboarders who spend a great deal of time together.

Womance, also called sismance, is the female flip side of bromance. It means a close non-sexual relationship between two or more women, a form of homosocial intimacy.


Turbatrix aceti

Turbatrix aceti (also called vinegar eels) is a species of nematode. They feed on the acidic bacteria from vinegar and other things, like fermented apples. They range from 1mm to 10mm long or larger. These nematodes go through a six-stage life cycle. The stages are: an egg, four larval stages, and reaching adulthood. They live about 10 months.

The nematode's reproductive system is sexual. Female vinegar eels have ovaries and produce eggs. Their reproductive system is in the form of a tube. The females also have a short sac-like seminal receptacle that stores sperm. A fertilized egg hatches in the uterus before leaving the womb. Vinegar eels give birth to as many as 45 babies every 8-10 days. A male vinegar eels’ reproductive system is smaller than the female’s. They have testis and a vas deferens. The testes open into a wide sperm duct and then into a muscular duct which can push out the sperm. The duct empties into a cloaca. 

Nematodes, such as the vinegar eels, have no circulatory system. Through their body’s wall, gas and excretion waste are diffused. Oxygen from the outside environment is diffused into the body, and carbon dioxide is diffused out of the body. Vinegar eels have to live in liquids that have enough oxygen so that it can diffuse into their bodies.

Experiments with "T. aceti" were done to understand the cause of ageing. DNA damage accumulates when the rate of damage occurrence is more than the rate of DNA repair. Accumulation of DNA damage leads to a decline in gene expression. There is a consistent decline in DNA repair capacity with age in the nematode. A second report measured the ability to repair DNA damage in young and old nematodes after exposure to ionizing radiation. They observed that the old nematodes were strikingly less able to carry out this type of DNA repair than young nematodes. These experiments suggest that a decline in DNA repair capability occurs with age. This is the "DNA damage theory of aging".


Edward Stratemeyer

Edward L. Stratemeyer (October 4, 1862 May 10, 1930) was an American publisher and a writer of children's stories. He was very prolific and created several children's series including "The Rover Boys", "The Bobbsey Twins", "Tom Swift", "The Hardy Boys", and "Nancy Drew". He founded the Stratemeyer Syndicate.

Bunryaku

, also romanized as Bunreki, was a after "Tenpuku" and before "Katei." This period started in November 1234 and ended in September 1235. The reigning emperor was .




Ribalonga

Ribalonga (from the Gallician "riba" - 'climb' and "longa" - 'long') is a Portuguese parish in the north of the Municipality of Alijó, in ‘Trás-dos-montes’ (‘behind the hills’). It has a population of 231 (2011) and an area of 9,15 km2 (density : 25,2/km2). Its patron saint is Saint Anna, mother of Saint Mary and therefore, grandmother of Jesus. 

The Castle of Ribalonga was a fortress that probably began to be inhabited on the Iron Age and continued on the Ancient Rome.
Ribalonga belonged on the 13th century to the parish of Vila Chã, on 1839 to Vila Real, on 1852 to Vilar de Maçada and on 1872 to Alijó.

The legend tells that in the year 2000, a man of the family Sampaio, whose descendants still live in the village, coming from the fair of Vilar de Maçada, brought with him some meat. Suddenly, he was followed by a pack of wolves and he became very scared, because he realized that the wolves were very hungry. When he arrived near the village, the wolves began to close the circle. When he saw himself lost, he got off his horse and knelt and asked the Lord of the Afflicted to save him from the wolves. At this moment, the dogs in the house of Mr. Sampaio began barking anxiously and the wife of the man let them go. They ran fast to the place where the man was and drove the wolves away. In recognition, he built a cross where he asked the Lord to help. A few days later, one of the dogs appeared, all hurt.
This cross can be seen today, a little bit degraded, on the place that has the name "Red Cross" and that is in the South of Ribalonga.

There is another legend of Ribalonga, referring to its place of St. Ana. There is a huge rock, rectangular, with three grooves at the top, the head, the torso and the limbs of a person.
The voice of the people, that same voice that describes the legends word by word, says that these signs were left there by St. Ana when she was on pilgrimage to holy places.
The legend tells that St. Ana, very tired and seeing no other place to lie down, took this rock to rest. And so the stone became soft for her to be comfortable and cosy, taking the shape of her body. And the next day, at dawn, her forces restored, she continued her journey. After that, people began to pass the rock to go to work and, noticing the furrows, they were amazed. Nobody knows how they came to the conclusion that it was St. Ana. Was it because they were devotees? No one can answer, the fact is that currently the village patron saint is St. Ana and the hills and the land around the place where the famous rock is, are known as "Santa Ana".

Ribalonga borders to Rapadoura, Vila Verde, Popúlo, Vilar de Maçada, Vila Chã and to the region of Douro. It has a lot of mountains, hills, pines and it's very stony.

The cuisine of Ribalonga is based on meat. There are a lot of different specialities like "cozido à portuguesa" ('Portuguese stew'), "feijoada à transmontana" (rice and black beans), "alheiras" or "linguiças" (both sausages). There are a lot of fields and vineyards too.

Tokyo Skytree

, formerly known as , is a broadcasting, restaurant, and observation tower in the city of Tokyo, the capital of Japan the special ward of Sumida, not far from the Sumida River. The nearest train station is Oshiage, which is on the Toei Asakusa Line, Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line, and railway lines operated by Tobu and Keisei.

The Tokyo Skytree was designed by the architects from Nikken Sekkei, a e company, the process of building the tower began in 2008 and was completed on 29 February 2012. Emperor Akihito visited the tower in advance of its official opening, and the opening ceremony took place on 22 May 2012.

With a height of , the Tokyo Skytree is the tallest structure in Japan. This height was chosen because it could be easily remembered. The figures 6 ("mu"), 3 ("sa"), 4 ("shi") stand for Musashi Province, which is an old name of the region where the tower stands.

It is the third tallest structure in the world behind Merdeka 118 in Malaysia and Burj Khalifa in Dubai. It is also the tallest tower in the world, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, because there is no space in the Skytree for people to live or work in, unlike the Burj Khalifa.

All of central Tokyo can be seen from special viewing platforms at and . At night, it is lit up with different coloured lights.


Jean Robieux

Grevenmacher

Grevenmacher () is a commune with city status in eastern Luxembourg, near the border with Germany.

Grevenmacher is the capital city of the Grevenmacher canton and of the district of Grevenmacher. The city is on the left bank of the Moselle river.

The name Grevenmacher is formed by two words: "Greven" and "Macher". "Macher" comes from the Latin word "maceria" ("very old walls"); "Greven" comes from the old German word "Grafen" (modern German: "Graf") that means "count, earl". The town "Macher of the Count" was, since 1346, different from other "Machern" found in the region: Königsmacher, Kleinmacher, Rodemacher, Mecher, Mézières etc. The present name of Grevenmacher has been in use since 1769.

The valley of the Moselle, which owes its wealth to the fact that it is close to the water and it has fertile land, was settled long before the Roman era. As for Grevenmacher, the first town was behind the Holy Cross Chapel at the place called "Buerggruef", not far from the Roman road to the city of Luxembourg.

A few centuries later, the Counts of Luxembourg chose a safe place to protect their land against the powerful archbishops of Trier. They found it in Grevenmacher, that was the place where the road going from the city of Luxembourg to Trier meet with the one going from Trier to Thionville. Here a strong fortress was built, probably on the orders of Count Henry V. In 1252, this same count made Grevenmacher a city.

The "commune" of Grevenmacher, which is in the eastern part of the canton on the left bank of the Moselle river, has an area of , with of forests and of vineyards.

The altitude of the "commune" is high. At the church, the altitude is high.

The most important river is the Moselle (; German: "Mosel"; ).

There were 4,923 persons living in the "commune" in 2017, for a population density of inhabitants/km².
Evolution of the population in Grevenmacher

Famous sights in Grevenmacher are, for exampleː

The city has three soccer places, two in "Op Floor" (there is also the stadium from the CSG, the soccer club from Grevenmacher) and one on the bank from the Mousel. The city has also six tennis fields, three in a hall and the other three on the bank of the Mousel. Next to the tennis fields is an outdoor swimming pool. Grevenmacher has also two sports halls.

The Ichneumonoidea are parasitoid wasps. They are a superfamily in the suborder Apocrita.

The superfamily is made up of the ichneumon wasps, (family Ichneumonidae), and the braconids (family Braconidae). The superfamily contains well over 80,000 different species. Members of the family Ichneumonidae are usually larger than members of the Braconidae, and the family has three times as many species as the braconids. The two families are distinguished mainly by details of wing venation.

Almost all are solitary insects, and most are parasitoids—the larvae feeding on or in another insect which finally dies. Being in the same order, ichneumonoids are closely related to other hymenoptera such as ants and bees. Many species in both families use polydnaviruses (with double strand DNA) to suppress the immune system of the host insect.

Some species use many different insects as hosts, others are very specific in host choice. Various ichneumons are used successfully as biological control agents in controlling pests such as flies or beetles.

Ichneumon wasp species are highly varied, ranging from to long. Most are slender, with the females of many species (particularly in the genus "Megarhyssa") having an extremely long ovipositor for laying eggs. The female finds a host and lays an egg on, near, or inside the host's body. Upon hatching, the larval ichneumon feeds either externally or internally, killing the host when they themselves are ready to pupate. Despite looking formidable, the ovipositor does not deliver a sting like many wasps or bees. It can be used by the wasps to bore through rotten wood, and lay eggs in grubs hiding under the wood.


Information asymmetry

Information asymmetry is a concept in economics and contract theory. It says that in any given contract the two parties of the contract do not have the same information. Information economics is a field of science that looks at some of the problems that result from this bias. Neoclassical economics assumes there is perfect information: all the actors know all the states of their environment; they can also observe what all the other actors do. Information is free -it has no cost in the economic sense. This is also true for the ability to observe the other parties.

A model called New institutional economics changes this: information is no longer free, there are costs associated with obtaining information.

Information asymmetry is concerned with three main asymmetries:

In 2001, the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz "for their analyses of markets with asymmetric information."


SWV

SWV (Sisters with Voices) are an African American female group that sing R&B music. The group was founded in 1990 and had multiple hit songs between then and 1998, one of which sampled the Michael Jackson hit song "Human Nature". The group broke up in 1998 but then reunited around 2005 and have been making music since.


Simpson's paradox

Simpson's paradox is a paradox from statistics. It is named after Edward H. Simpson, a British statistician who first described it in 1951. The statistician Karl Pearson described a very similar effect in 1899.- Udny Yule's description dates from 1903. Sometimes, it is called the Yule–Simpson effect. When looking at the statistical scores of groups, these scores may change, depending on whether the groups are looked at one by one, or if they are combined into a larger group. This case often occurs in social sciences and medical statistics. It may confuse people, if frequency data is used to explain a causal relationship. Other names for the paradox include "reversal paradox" and "amalgamation paradox".
This is a real-life example from a medical study comparing the success rates of two treatments for kidney stones.

The table shows the success rates and numbers of treatments for treatments involving both small and large kidney stones, where Treatment A includes all open procedures and Treatment B is percutaneous nephrolithotomy:

The paradoxical conclusion is that treatment A is more effective when used on small stones, and also when used on large stones, yet treatment B is more effective when considering both sizes at the same time. In this example, it was not known that the size of the kidney stone influenced the result. This is called a hidden variable (or lurking variable) in statistics.

Which treatment is considered better is determined by an inequality between two ratios (successes/total). The reversal of the inequality between the ratios, which creates Simpson's paradox, happens because two effects occur together:

Coat of arms of Argentina

The coat of arms of Argentina was used in its current form in 1944. It started in the seal of the General Constituent Assembly of 1813. 

It is not known who made the coat of arms. At the top is the gold-yellowed Sun of May, also found on the flag of Argentina. The rising sun is for the rising of Argentina. In the center, there are two shaking hands. This is for the unity of the Provinces of Argentina. The hands come together to hold a pike. This shows power and willingness to defend freedom. The Phrygian cap is on the top of the spear.

The blue and white colors are for the Argentine people. They are the same colors of the Argentine flag. The blue half is for the sky and the white is for the Río de la Plata.

Patagonia

Patagonia is at the southern end of South America. It is land shared by Argentina and Chile. It has some of the most dramatic landscapes on Earth. It has the southern section of the Andes mountains to the southwest towards the Pacific ocean.

It follows south through the Colorado River towards Carmen de Patagones in the Atlantic Ocean. To the west, it includes the Valdivia through Tierra del Fuego archipelago.

The name Patagonia is from the word "patagón" used by Magellan in 1520. The word was for the native people that his expedition thought to be giants. Now people think the Patagons were actually Tehuelches. They had an average height of 180 cm (~5′11″) compared to the 155 cm (~5′1″) average for Spaniards of the time.

The guanaco, the cougar, the Patagonian fox, the Patagonian hog-nosed skunk, and the Magellanic Tuco-tuco are the most common mammals of the Patagonian plains. There are also many birds. Southern Caracara, Austral parakeets, and Green-backed Firecrowns are some. Waterfowl include Chilean Flamingo, Upland Goose, and steamer ducks.

Famous marine fauna include the southern right whale, the Magellanic Penguin, the orca and elephant seals. The Valdés Peninsula is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its importance as a nature reserve.

Omen

An omen is a sign that is thought to foretell the future, often signifying the advent of change. The word can mean something either "good" or "bad" is about to happen. The origin of the word is unknown, although it may be connected with the Latin word "audire", meaning "to hear". An example from the past, babies born with birth defects were believed to be a bad or evil omen.


Boyacá

Boyacá is one of the 32 departments of Colombia. It is in the central northeastern part of the country, almost entirely within the mountains of the Eastern Cordillera to the border with Venezuela, although the western end of the department extends to the Magdalena River. Its capital is Tunja.

Boyacá is known as "The Land of Freedom" because in this region there were several battles that resulted in the independence of Colombia from Spain.

The territory of present-day Boyacá was inhabited, during the Pre-Columbian time, by "Muisca" indigenous peoples. They lived mainly by agriculture and mining gold and emeralds.

The first European to discover the area was the Spaniard Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. In 1539, Gonzalo Suárez Rendón, a Spanish colonist, founded the city of Tunja and other places. Tunja became one of the main political and economic centers for the Spanish during the "Viceroyalty of New Granada".

During the 19th century Boyaca was battleground of several important battles during the war of Independence; two of the most important were the "Battle of the Pantano de Vargas" (Vargas Swamp Battle) on 25 July 1819, and the "Battle of Boyacá" on 7 August 1819.

The Boyacá department is in the Andean region over the mountains of the Eastern Cordillera (the eastern section of the Andes in Colombia). It borders 8 departments: Santander and Norte de Santander to the north, Arauca and Casanare to the east, Cundinamarca and Meta to the south, and Caldas and Antioquia to the west. It also borders with Venezuela.

Boyacá has an area of , most of it on a plateau. Its highest point is Ritacuba Blanco () in the Eastern Cordillera; it is high.

Many rivers start in this area; the most important are the Chicamocha and Arauca rivers, tributaries to other important rivers such as the Magdalena and Meta rivers.

Boyacá also has numerous lakes; the largest, and the largest in Colombia, is the Lake Tota with an area of .

The area around Tunja, at an altitude of about , is characterized by climates with few extremes of temperature and ample precipitation in all months. The Köppen climate classification type for the climate at Tunja is a "Marine West Coast Climate" and of the subtype "Cfb".

The average amount of precipitation for the year in Tunja is . The month with the most precipitation on average is October with of precipitation. The month with the least precipitation on average is January with an average of . There is an average of 179.0 days of precipitation, with the most precipitation occurring in May with 19.0 days and the least precipitation occurring in January with 6.0 days.

The average temperature for the year in Tunja is . The warmest month, on average, is March with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is July, with an average temperature of .

There are 13 provinces and two special districts in the Boyacá Department, listed below with their 123 municipalities. The provincial capitals are in bold.

Argentine Antarctica

Argentine Antarctica is a part of Antarctica claimed by Argentina as part of its national territory. This claim overlaps with British and Chilean claims in Antarctica. Argentine Antarctica is a department of the province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and South Atlantic Islands.

The Argentine exploration to the continent started early in the 20th century. José María Sobral was the first Argentine to set foot on Antarctica in 1901. He spent 2 seasons with the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of Doctor Otto Nordenskiöld. In 1904, the Orcadas Base was fully working. Years later other bases were made. The first Argentine expedition to reach the South Pole was the 1965 Operación 90.

Argentine actions in Antarctica are coordinated by the Instituto Antartico Argentino

According the last Argentine national census, on October 2010 (winter) there were 230 people in the six permament bases.

The geography of Argentine Antarctica has some features of the Patagonia. The highest peaks are at the south of the Antarctic Peninsula. The land is under an ice sheet.

The region has a polar climate, with strong winds, snow and thick clouds.

Chilean Antarctic Territory

The Chilean Antarctic Territory is the territory in Antarctica claimed by Chile since 1940. The Chilean Antarctic Territory overlaps Argentine and British Antarctic claims.

Within Chilean territorial organization Antártica is the name of the commune that administers the territory. Belongs to Antártica Chilena Province, which is part of Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region. The commune of Antártica was created on July 11, 1961, and was dependent on the Magallanes Province until 1975, when the Antártica Chilena Province was created, making it dependent administratively on Puerto Williams, the province capital.

The Antarctic Treaty froze all the Antartic claims.

List of Chilean Antarctic Bases:

(P): Permanent; Are open all the year.
(S): Seasonal; Are open in the Austral Summer.

Villa Las Estrellas is the only civil settlement in a Chilean Base, the other one is in Esperanza Base (Argentina) and it's called "Fortín Sargento Cabral"

The only permanent Chilean base on the Antarctic Peninsula is Base General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme. It has been working since February 18, 1948. It is located on Puerto Covadonga.

In 2009, 935 people lived in the commune. They are called the "Béardais".

Between 1841 and 1846, the population fell from 720 to 354 inhabitants, and continued to fall until the end of the Second World War. Today it has reached its highest population since records began.


Ampullariidae

Ampullariidae, the apple snails, is a family of large freshwater snails. It is the largest species of snail. Apple snails are most commonly found in Africa, South and Central America, West Indies, Southern USA, and Asia, but can be found all over the world. They are well adapted to their region and therefore can also be sold as pets and bought at most pet stores in the US. Apple snails are the preferred type of pet snail because of their appearance and size. Apple snails are also called golden mystery snails, golden snails, and mystery snails.

Apple snails live in water. They prefer water temperatures between 18°-28° Celsius, or 65°-82° Fahrenheit. They eat things like fresh fruits, lettuce, other vegetables, algae and wafers. However, they are not called apple snails because they eat apples. They get their name from the fact that one species of apple snails can grow to be the size of an apple. Apple snails are also common aquarium pets because of their size. They also prefer to be with other snails. They are good pets because they can live in almost any water condition, for example, water with low/high levels of oxygen, and various temperatures. Although they can live in water with high oxygen, this makes them move slower.

A snail has a basic anatomy like any other mollusk. They have a shell, a nervous system, a circulatory system, a respiratory system, and a reproductive system. The circulatory system has an open heart system, which pumps blood which flows over all of the organs in the snails body without veins or arteries. The respiratory system includes gills and lungs. They need gills to be able to live in water. They have lungs because their bodies adapted to their environment because of frequent droughts; so they need lungs to breathe during the droughts. Their nervous system includes their brain, which controls their body. They are one of the only species of snails that are not hermaphrodites. Each gender has its own reproductive parts.

Apple snails are herbivores, so they eat mostly aquatic vegetation, and algae. In captivity, they are commonly fed fish food, along with supplements of rotting organic waste, such as vegetables.. To digest food, apple snails first break up food with the radula teeth, and then the food will be swallowed, and travel down the esophagus and to the stomach. It will eventually exit through the anus as feces. Apple snails will eat most aquatic vegetation, and can "ruin" the look of an aquarium very quickly, as they are scavengers.

Apple snails have an open circulatory system. This means that the heart pumps blood, but instead of it pumping through veins and arteries like humans have, the blood washes over the organs, and the organs absorb it on contact. After the blood is pumped and the nutrients have been absorbed, it flows back to the heart to take the carbon dioxide away and to get new oxygen.

The apple snails are not hermaphrodite, like most snails, meaning that they have two genders.

The male snail has two kinds of sperm. One is for attaching onto the female's egg, and the function of the other sperm is unknown.

The female's eggs are stored in the "ovaria" which is near the digestive gland. It goes to the receptaculum seminis, where the male's sperm is stored. The eggs are fertilized here. Then, after the eggs are fertilized, they are sent to the shell gland which will give the eggs a protective shell. After, they shall continue down their tube and leave the mother's body, waiting to be hatched.


Lottery

Lottery is a form of gambling where people pick numbers for a prize, usually money. It is forbidden by some governments although allowed by others. Until after World War II, lottery systems were banned in most countries, including the United States and Europe. Nowadays, lottery is a real method of revenue in some countries, including United States.

Hilbert's problems

In 1900, the mathematician David Hilbert published a list of 23 unsolved mathematical problems. The list of problems turned out to be very influential. After Hilbert's death, another problem was found in his writings; this is sometimes known as Hilbert's 24th problem today. This problem is about finding criteria to show that a solution to a problem is the simplest possible.

Of the 23 problems, three were unresolved in 2012, three were too vague to be resolved, and six could be partially solved. Given the influence of the problems, the Clay Mathematics Institute formulated a similar list, called the Millennium Prize Problems in 2000.

The formulation of certain problems is better than that of others. 
Of the cleanly-formulated Hilbert problems, problems 3, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, and 21 have a resolution that is accepted by consensus. On the other hand, problems 1, 2, 5, 9, 15, 18, and 22 have solutions that have partial acceptance, but there exists some controversy as to whether it resolves the problem.

The solution for problem 18, the Kepler conjecture, uses a computer-assisted proof. This is controversial, because a human reader is unable to verify the proof in reasonable time. 

That leaves 16, 8 (the Riemann hypothesis) and 12 unresolved. On this classification 4, 16, and 23 are too vague to ever be described as solved. The withdrawn 24 would also be in this class. 6 is considered as a problem in physics rather than in mathematics.

Hilbert's twenty-three problems are:

Energy drink

Energy drinks are beverages whose producers say they can "can boost energy". This claim has to do with vitamins and stimulants in these drinks. Examples of energy drinks are Red Bull and Monster Energy. They are usually well liked by young people. 66% of energy drink sales are to people between the ages of 14 and 35. Up to a third of children in the UK have at least one energy drink every week.

They are a subset of the larger group of energy products, which includes bars and gels; they are also different from sports drinks, which are advertised to improve sports performance. There are many brands and varieties in this drink category.

Energy drinks have the effects of caffeine and sugar, but there is little or no evidence that many other ingredients have any effect. Most effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine. Other studies ascribe those performance improvements to the effects of the combined ingredients.

There is evidence that these drinks are harmful to the mental and physical health of children and young people, as well as their behaviour and education. Some supermarkets have introduced a voluntary ban on the sale of energy drinks to under-16s. The British government said they would ban energy drinks for under-16s in England in 2019, but in 2024 that has not happened. The British Soft Drinks Association says their voluntary code of practice says BSDA members do not market or promote energy drinks to under-16s.

The ballet was first performed in the Salle Le Peletier in Paris on March 12, 1832. The ballet was a great success. Taglioni was regarded as the greatest ballerina of the age. 

The ballet is set in Scotland. James is on the eve of marrying Effie. Gurn also loves Effie. James is distracted by a vision of a lovely sylph. Old Madge, a witch, reads palms. She declares Gurn will be the husband of Effie. James grows angry and throws her out into the storm. The wedding preparations start. The sylph appears and steals the wedding ring. James runs after her into the forest. Effie is consoled in the arms of Gurn. 

In the forest, the sylph and James dally romantically. The sylph summons her sister sylphs. They entertain James with several dances. He wants to capture the sylph, and asks Old Madge for her help. She gives him a poisoned scarf, but tells him he can capture the sylph with it. He wraps the sylph in the scarf. Her wings fall off and she dies. James sees a wedding procession led by Gurn and Effie. He faints and dies. Old Madge has had her revenge.

In November 1836, August Bournonville choreographed his version to music by Herman Severin Løvenskiold for the Royal Danish Ballet. Taglioni's choreography has been lost, but Bournonville's exists and is still danced in Copenhagen. In 1972, Pierre Lacotte reconstructed Taglioni's choreography from prints, notes, and other materials.

Substitute good

In economics two or more goods can be classified by looking at the demand curve when the price of one of these goods changes. That way they will either be classified as substitutes or complementary goods. Two goods are substitutes if the demand of one good increases and the price of the other good increases. In this case, consumers will replace one good with the other. 

Classic examples of substitute goods include margarine and butter, or tea and coffee. Substitute goods not only occur on the consumer side of the market but also the producer side. Substitutable producer goods would include: petroleum and natural gas (used for heating or electricity). The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demand for the two kinds of good will be bound together by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if they get an advantage by to do so.

Perfect substitutes can replace each other, without trade-off in costs, or quality. For imperfect substitutes, the customer has to make a trade-off, either in price, or in quality. Artificial leather is much cheaper than real leather, and can replace it in many situations - artificial and real leather are substitute goods. Real leather is much more durable, and has a different look and feel. When these factors are important, the two are not interchangeable. For this reason artificial and real leather are imperfect substitutes.

Complementary good

In microeconomics, complementary goods are goods whose utility is increased if they are consumed together. This means that the demand curve for both goods will move in the same direction, if the price changes. If the demand curve does not change in the same direction, in case of a price change, the goods are substitute goods. 

Split, Croatia

Split is the second largest city in Croatia. About 211.000 people lived there in 2012. The city is the biggest and most important one in Dalmatia. It is often called "capital of Dalmatia".

There is an important shipyard in Split. Other sources of income are tourism, fishery, paper mills, cement works and some chemical industry.

Mongol invasions of Japan

The two failed invasion attempts are important because they were defining events in Japanese history. 

The attempts show the limits of Mongol (Yuan Dynasty) ability to expand the Chinese empire.


After the destruction of the Mongol invaders, Japan's independence was guaranteed. A power struggle within Japan led to the growth of military governments and less Imperial power.



Genkō yōshi

"Genkō yōshi" may be used with any type of writing instruments pencil, pen, or an ink brush.

"Genkō yōshi" is used for vertical writing. On a sheet of "genkō yōshi", there is no pre-determined order; there is instead a system of space, which can be designed freely.

One page of Japanese with 400 characters generally equals 225-250 words in English. In other words, an essay of about 10,000 words would be the same as 40-45 "genko yoshi".

"Genkō yōshi" came into common use in the Meiji period. Newspapers and magazines needed to count characters.

The current President is Javier Milei. He was sworn in on 10 December 2023.

List of vice presidents of Argentina

The Vice President of Argentina is a senior official of Argentina who integrates the electoral team accompanying the citizen who is elected President of Argentina, and whose main function is to replace him in case of temporary absence, or in case of permanent absence for disability, death or resignation. In Argentine history, there have also been de facto vice presidents, imposed as a result of coups d'état, although not all governments headed by de facto presidents had the presence of a vice president. This is the second highest political position in Argentina.

The Vice President replaces the President if the President cannot do the job. The vice president is not a member of the National Executive Power and only assumes the presidency in the absence or inability of the president to exercise power. During the time that the vice president does not exercise the Executive Power, his function is to be president of the Senate, without a vote unless there is a tie, in which case he has the power to break the tie. The Argentine Constitution does not have any provision on the replacement of a Vice President. The usual constitutional practice has been to leave the position vacant in the event of death, disability, removal or resignation.

Kepler conjecture

The Kepler conjecture is a problem in math. It wants to know the best way to put spheres together so there will be only a little bit of room between the spheres. That means the spheres are put together very tightly, meaning they are dense. 

The Kepler conjecture is about Sphere packing in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It is named after Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) who first had this idea. Kepler supposed that the ways to pack spheres of equal size that result in the packing with the highest density are face-centered cubic or hexagonal packings. Those two things are crystal structures, meaning ways to put things together in a repeating pattern. These packings have a density of slightly over 74 percent, this means that they fill about 74 percent of space available.

Sphere packing

In geometry, Sphere packing refers to a number of problems that try to arrange spheres in space. Very often, the spheres all have the same size, and the space used is usually three-dimensional Euclidean space. The problem is part of packing problems. When it is generalised, not all the spheres need to have the same size, and spaces can be n-dimensional Euclidean space, or hyperbolic space.

A typical sphere packing problem is to find an arrangement in which the spheres fill as large a proportion of the space as possible. The proportion of space filled by the spheres is called the density of the arrangement. As the local density of a packing in an infinite space can vary depending on the volume over which it is measured, the problem is usually to maximise the average or asymptotic density, measured over a large enough volume.

M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle

The Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) was a group of American automatic rifles and light machine guns. It was used by the United States and several other countries. The most-used type of BAR was the M1918. It was designed by John Browning in 1917. It was supposed to replace the French Chauchat and the M1909 Benet-Mercie machine guns.

The BAR was designed to be carried by soldiers that were moving forward. It was supposed to be put over the shoulder on a strap and fired from the hip. This was called "walking fire". It was thought that walking fire was needed for trench warfare. However, it was usually used as a light machine gun and fired from a bipod.

When the United States joined World War I, they did not have very good machine guns. One reason for this was because there was no military doctrine for their use. The U.S. declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917. At this time, the commanders were told that the U.S. only had 670 M1909 Benet-Mercies, 282 M1904 Maxims and 158 Colts, M1895 to fight the war. After a lot of arguments, they decided that the U.S. would have to build up more American weapons. However, until then, U.S. soldiers would have to take what the French and British could give them. The machine guns given to the U.S. by the French were often not very good. They also fired different cartridges from what the U.S. soldiers usually used. This meant that soldiers and machine gunners had to be given different kinds of cartridge.

In 1917, before the United States joined the First World War, John Browning brought two weapons to Washington, D.C. These were: a water-cooled machine gun (later named the M1917 Browning machine gun) and an automatic rifle. Back then, this automatic rifle was called the Browning Machine Rifle or BMR. Both of these weapons fired the standard U.S. cartridge. John Browning had set up a demonstration of the weapons at Congress Heights. Congress Heights is just outside of Washington D.C. On 27 February 1917, Browning tested the automatic rifle in front of 300 people. The crowd was so impressed that he was immediately given a contract for the weapon. It was quickly brought into service. The water-cooled machine gun was tested further.

More tests were done for U.S. Army weapon officers at Springfield Armory in May 1917. Both weapons were recommended to be brought into service immediately. So that the BAR was not confused with the M1917 machine gun, it was officially named the M1918 or Rifle, Caliber .30, Automatic, Browning, M1918. On 16 July 1917, 12,000 BARs were ordered from Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company. They were allowed to make the BAR under Browning's patents (Browning's patent 1293022 was owned by Colt). However, Colt was already making as many weapons as they could (as they were making the Vickers machine gun for the British Army). They asked for the military to wait a while, as they were opening a new factory in Meriden, Connecticut. Because of how much the weapon was needed, the request was turned down. The Winchester Repeating Arms Company (WRAC) would make the weapons instead. Winchester also helped out with the BAR's final design.

Since work on the gun did not begin until February 1918, Winchester was hurrying to make many BARs. They were in such a rush that the first 1,800 guns were delivered with things wrong. The contract with Winchester said that they had to make 25,000 BARs. Winchester were making many BARs by June 1918. By July, they were making 9,000 guns a month.

Colt and Marlin-Rockwell Corp. also began making BARs just after Winchester started making a lot of them. Marlin-Rockwell had a contract to make BARs for the Belgian government. They bought the Mayo Radiator Co.'s factory. They only used it to make the BAR. The first BAR from Marlin-Rockwell was delivered on 11 June 1918. The company eventually started making 200 BARs per day. Colt had only made 9,000 BARs when the armistice was signed. This was because they were busy with other orders. Together, the three companies made 706 BARs every day. Around 52,000 BARs were delivered by all companies by the end of WWI. Between 1918 and 1919, 102,125 BARs were made. Colt made 16,000, Winchester made 47,123 and Marlin-Rockwell made 39,002 BARs.

By July 1918, the BAR had arrived in France. The first unit to get BARs was the U.S. Army's 79th Infantry Division. The division used them for the first time on 13 September 1918. Even though it was brought in very late in the war, the BAR made a large effect. It was used a lot during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The other Allies were impressed by the BAR. France asked for 15,000 BARs to replace their Chauchat.

The M1918 is a selective fire automatic rifle. It fires from an open bolt.

The weapon's barrel can not be removed quickly. The M1918 gets its ammunition from a 20-round box magazine. 40-round magazines were also used to shoot down aircraft. However, these stopped being used in 1927. Not many bayonets for the BAR were made. Because of this, they are very rare.

Because the M1918 was supposed to be used as a support weapon, it did not have a place to put a bayonet. No bayonets were ever used on a BAR. Winchester did make one BAR with a place to put a bayonet, but it was only for testing.

During its long time in service, the M1918 was developed further and further. It was upgraded many times. The first big try at making the M1918 better made the M1922 light machine gun. The M1922 was taken into service with the United States Cavalry in 1922. The weapon used a new type of barrel. It also had a bipod with spikes on the end. The handguard was also changed.

In 1931, the Colt Arms Co. made the Colt Monitor Automatic Machine Rifle (R 80). This was mostly meant to be used by prison guards and the police. The Colt Monitor did not have a bipod. The Colt Monitor weighed around 16 lb. 3 oz. without any ammunition in it. It had a rate of fire of around 500 rpm. Around 125 Colt Monitor automatic rifles were made. 90 of these were bought by the FBI. Eleven rifles went to the U.S. Treasury Department in 1934. The rest went to many prisons, banks, security companies and police departments.

In 1932, a much shorter version of the M1918 BAR designed for 'bush warfare' was made by USMC Major H.L. Smith. Captain Merritt A. Edson wrote a report on this rifle. Edson was the Ordnance officer at the Quartermaster's Depot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The barrel was made nine inches shorter (229 mm), and there were some other changes as well. The changed BAR weighed 13 lb. 12 oz. and was only long. This version was more accurate than the BAR when firing automatically and while lying down, it was less accurate when fired from the shoulder. It was also very loud. Though the report written by Edson said that six of the 'jungle' BARs should be built for testing, no more work was done on the project.

The M1918A1 had a light bipod with spikes on it, along with some other new features. It was brought into service on 24 June 1937. Not many M1918s were rebuilt to be M1918A1s.

In April 1938, work was started on an improved BAR for the U.S. Army. Early prototypes had bipods that were put onto the barrel. It also had a special mechanism to make the rate of fire less. However, in 1939 the Army

Final development of the M1918A2 started on 30 June 1938. The M1918A2's buttstock (the part of the gun which sticks out at the back) is about one inch longer than the M1918 BAR buttstock. Late in the war, a handle was put onto the barrel to carry the weapon around.

Because the companies did not have a lot of money, the first M1918A2s were just older M1918 BARs that were changed. A small amount M1922s and M1918A1s were also changed. After WWII started, it was tried to make more M1918A2s. However, the World War I tools used to make the M1918 were either worn out or could not be used with modern machines. In 1942, there was not enough wood to make the buttstocks, so a black plastic buttstock was made for the BAR. Firestone Rubber and Latex Products Company made the plastic buttstock for the U.S. Army. This was brought into service on March 21, 1942.

In 2008, one company made a modern, semi-automatic version of the Browning Automatic Rifle. This was called the 1918A3 SLR ("self-loading rifle").

When the war ended, Colt Arms Co. were given the Browning patents to make the BAR that was not given out during the war. This allowed Colt to make the BAR for sale to civilians. This BAR was called the Colt Automatic Machine Rifle Model 1919. It was first made up of M1918s from the contract with the military which were not delivered. It was one of several Colt BARs. However, the weapon had a high price. It was also not very useful to civilians. Because of this, it did not sell much. Ad Topperwien was a famous shooter of the early 1920s. He bought one of the first Colt BARs to shoot things out of the sky. When the National Firearms Act of 1934 was passed, civilian BARs were restricted. Machine guns for U.S. civilians were banned in 1968. Also, making machine guns for U.S. civilians was banned in 1986.

Clyde Barrow, a gangster, liked the army's M1918. He got his BARs by robbing the Army National Guard. Barrow taught his girlfriend Bonnie Parker to fire the M1918 as well.

Automatic weapons were becoming more popular with gangsters in the United States. Because of this, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover told the FBI to train agents with automatic weapons. Examples were the Thompson submachine gun and the BAR. The FBI bought its BARs from Colt. Colt sold 90 BARs to the agency. Some of the FBI's BARs were sent to FBI offices. They were to be used as support weapons if they were needed. The rest were kept at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. They were there for training. Colt sold another 11 BARs to the U.S. Treasury Department in 1934. 24 guns were sold to prisons, banks, security companies and police departments.

It has sometimes been said that the M1918 or M1918A2 BAR was used by Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) members in a shootout with Los Angeles police. This happened on 17 May 1974. However, no SLA members ever used such a weapon. This confusion happened because Browning decided to call its semi-automatic hunting rifle the Browning BAR. The SLA changed a Browning BAR hunting rifle to automatic fire. It was this weapon that was used in the shootout.

When it first came into service, the M1918 was supposed to be fired from the shoulder. It was meant to be a rifle that could give both semi-automatic and fully automatic fire. The M1918 was first given out in September 1918.

As well as being fired from the shoulder, M1918 gunners were given a belt which had pouches on it for the magazines. They were also given a sidearm.

The BAR was not used much during World War I. This was partly because of the Armistice, and also because the U.S. Army did not want the enemy to be able to capture an M1918. 85,000 BARs were built by the war's end.

In between World War I and World War II, the M1918 was given to all U.S. naval landing forces. The weapon could be found on board most U.S. ships. Each BAR had a spare barrel. Big ships often had over 200 BARs on board. Many of the U.S. Navy BARs were still used until the 1960s.

When the threat of a new war rose, U.S. Army Ordnance realized they did not have a squad light machine gun that could be moved around easily. They tried to use the M1918 BAR as a light machine gun when the M1918A2 was brought into service with the U.S. Army on 30 June 1938. The BAR was given as the only automatic gun for a squad of eight soldiers. All men were trained how to use the BAR in case the gunner(s) were killed or injured. At the start of the war, most BAR teams were two or three people. These were a gunner and one or two assistants who carried extra magazines for the gun. By 1944, some units' BAR teams were just one person, with the other people in the squad carrying ammunition.




Río de la Plata

The Río de la Plata (called River Plate in British English) is a river in Argentina. It is an estuary made from the Uruguay River and the Paraná River. These rivers are on the border between Argentina and Uruguay. It is about long.

The Río de la Plata widens from about at the inner part to about at its mouth. Buenos Aires is on its western shore. Montevideo is on its northern shores.

The Río de la Plata is home for the loggerhead sea turtle, green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, the rare La Plata dolphin, and many species of fish.

The first naval battle of the Second World War was fought near the River Plata. The Kriegsmarine "pocket battleship" "Admiral Graf Spee" was engaged by the Royal Navy cruisers, , and off the estuary of the River Plate in December 1939. 

The German ship retired up the estuary with a crippled fuel system and put into port at Montevideo. A few days later, rather than fight outgunned against the British, she was scuttled in the estuary. This engagement was part of the early Battle of the Atlantic skirmishes. 


Paraguay River

The Paraguay River is a major river in south central South America. It goes through Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is about long. It starts in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. It ends when it joins the Paraná River north of Corrientes. The biggest city on the river is Asunción, the capital city of Paraguay, which is located at its meeting with the Putumayo River.

Bermejo River

The Bermejo River is a river in South America. It flows from Bolivia to the Paraguay River in Argentina. 
The river is long. The Bermejo is not able to be travelled on. 

Colorado River (Argentina)

The Colorado River is a river in the south of Argentina. The man-made "Embalse Casa de Piedra" dam is on the river. It starts on the eastern slopes of the Andes. It ends in the Atlantic Ocean just south of Bahía Blanca. 

Templo Libertad

The Templo Libertad is a synagogue in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is the home of the Argentinian Israelite Congregation and the Jewish history museum.

Beth Yaacov Synagogue (Madrid)

The Beth Yaacov Synagogue is a synagogue in Madrid, Spain. It is the main center of the Jewish community of Spain.


Paraná River

The Paraná River is a river in south Central South America. It goes through Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. It is long. It is second in length only to the Amazon River among South American rivers. The name Paraná is a shortened form of the phrase "para rehe onáva". It is a Tupi word that means "like the sea". 

It starts where the Paranaiba and Grande rivers join in southern Brazil. It joins the Paraguay River and continues south, where it merges with Uruguay River, before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean.

The surubí and the sábalo are fished on the river.

There are many dams along the river. The Yacyretá and Itaipu are used for hydroelectric power.

Pampas

The Pampas are fertile South American lowlands. It is from a Quechua word meaning "plain". It covers more than . That includes parts of Argentina, Uruguay, and the southernmost Brazilian State. The climate is generally subtropical and . There is around 31962920 people in this area, mainly because of the inclusion of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. 

Some of the wildlife includes the rhea, the pampas deer, several species of armadillos, the pampas fox, the , the , and several other species. Frequent wildfires mean that only small plants such as grasses live, and trees are rare.

Nobuyuki Abe

, also known as Noboyuki Abe, was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army, Governor-General of Korea, and 36th Prime Minister of Japan from August 30, 1939 to January 16, 1940.

Abe was born into an ex-samurai family in Kanazawa city, Ishikawa Prefecture. 

Abe attended Tokyo No.1 Middle School (Tokyo Metropolitan Hibiya High School) followed by No.4 High School. While still a student, he volunteered for military service during the First Sino-Japanese War.

After the war, Abe graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. He was part of the 19th class of the Army War College. 

Abe became commander of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment from 1918-1921. In August 1918, his regiment was sent to Siberia during Japan's Siberian Intervention, but was never in combat.

Abe was appointed commander of the 4th Infantry Division on December 22, 1930. 

He later served as instructor in the Army War College followed by chief of the Military Affairs Bureau and as Vice Minister of the Army.

In 1933, Abe was promoted to full general. He was Commander-in-Chief of the Taiwan Army. 

In 1936, he was placed on the reserve list.

Abe Nobuyuki became 36th Prime Minister on August 30, 1939. 

Abe was replaced by Mitsumasa Yonai in January 1940.

Abe joined the House of Peers in 1942.

He was appointed the 10th (and last) Governor-General of Korea in 1944 and 1945.

After World War II, Abe was arrested by the Americans under General Douglas MacArthur. He was not charged with any war crimes and he was soon released.


Femminiello

A femminiello, also spelled femmeniello is an Italian word for a male with feminine nature and behaviour, and part of an old tradition in Neapolitan culture. They are believed to bring luck in gambling and are known to participate in games such as bingo and also some traditional events.



Bourrée

The Bourrée is a quick double time dance of French origins. It is similar to a Gavotte, but has a 1 beat anacruis (upbeat), where the gavotte has a 2 beat anacrusis.

It often has a rhythm with a strong beat followed by two weaker ones. For example, an accented crochet followed by two quavers. This is called dactylic.

North London Collegiate School

North London Collegiate School is an independent school for girls between the ages of 4-18. It is located in Harrow, London. It was established by Frances Mary Buss in 1850. Frances Mary Buss originally opened the school in her own home in Camden Town, London. It later moved to Canons, Edgware in the 1930s. It is thought to be the first girls' school in the United Kingdom, and the first to give girls the same chances to learn things as boys were given.
Girls travel from all over London to attend the school. Famous women who were pupils there include Anna Wintour, Susie Orbach, and Rachel Weisz.

In September 2011 NLCS opened a new school in Jeju, South Korea. NLCS Jeju is a mixed school. 

Jacques Villiers

Jacques Villiers, (26 August 1924 – 13 March 2012) is a French aerospace engineer and public servant. He is the founder of the "Centre d'études de la navigation aérienne" (French air navigation center) and co-founder of the CAUTRA system, the computer system of the French air traffic management.

In the words of Michel Wachenheim: "We can consider Jacques Villiers as one of the main
founders of "the French school of air navigation" with everything
it has scientific expertise, know-how
technological and operational experience. He quickly understood
that France could and should play a leading role in this
sector, because of its aviation history, its ability to
train highly qualified specialists, but also its global ambitions
and European geography. He retained confident until the end that we could provide leadership in technical
international level, I am reminded of conversations with him on this
subject. The best tribute to him is certainly to continue
in this way."


Entity–relationship model

In software engineering, an entity–relationship model is a conceptual model of data. Very often, the term is shortened to ER model. ER models are used to create relational databases. They show how the different parts of a data model interact with each other.

Peter Chen proposed to use this modelling approach in an article he wrote in 1976. Chen was not the first to have this idea. After the publication of the article, the idea was modified as well.

In an ER model, there are three different types of objects:
Since the database must be able to find an entity or a relationship, it must be able to identify it with a set of attributes that is unique. This set of attributes is usually called "primary key".
After all the relations have been mapped, they are usually also revised to include cardinalities; a cardinality specifies the number of entities related in a relationship. This information is needed when the database is created. Depending on cardinality and the level of database normalisation, it may be necessary to introduce additional entities and relationships. 
When everything has been described, it is easy to create a relational database, as follows:

An ER model describes the relations between entities. It is adapted to represent relational data. Data that cannot easily be put into this form should not be modelled with an ER model. ER is aimed at designing a database from scratch; using it to describe and change a database that already exists may be more difficult to do.

Even where it is suitable in principle, ER modeling is rarely used as a separate activity.
One reason for this is that there are many tools that allow diagramming and that have other design support directly on relational database management systems.
These tools can extract database diagrams that are very close to ER diagrams from existing databases, and they provide alternative views on the information contained in such diagrams.

In a survey, Brodie and Liu could not find a single instance of entity–relationship modeling inside a sample of ten Fortune 100 companies. Badia and Lemire blame this lack of use on the lack of guidance but also on the lack of benefits, such as lack of support for data integration.

Andrew Wiles

Sir Andrew John Wiles, KBE, FRS (born Cambridge, 11 April 1953) is an Abel Prize-winning British mathematician and a Royal Society Research Professor at Oxford University. He specializes in number theory. He is most famous for proving Fermat's Last Theorem. He is a foreign member of the United States National Academy of Sciences since 1996. 

In the summer of 1986, Wiles decided to prove the theorem. Gerhard Frey, Jean-Pierre Serre and Ken Ribet had done successful research in the last few years. Wiles realised that he could prove a limited form of the modularity theorem. So, he decided to solve this problem. This was done somewhat secretly. In 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge. In August 1993, however, it turned out that the proof contained a gap. Wiles tried to fill in this gap. But the error he made was a very basic one. Wiles got the crucial idea for avoiding, rather than closing this gap. This came to him on 19 September 1994. Together with his former student Richard Taylor, he published a second paper. This avoided the error and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in 1995 in a special volume of the "Annals of Mathematics".

Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was scrutinized by mathematical experts. Wiles was interviewed for an episode of the BBC documentary series "Horizon" that focused on Fermat's Last Theorem. This was renamed "The Proof". It was made an episode of the Public Broadcasting Service's science television series "Nova".

Richard Taylor (mathematician)

Richard Lawrence Taylor (born 19 May 1962) is a British mathematician. He works in number theory. He was a former research student of Andrew Wiles. He returned to Princeton to help Wiles complete the proof of Fermat's last theorem.

Taylor received the 2007 Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences. This for his work on the Langlands program. He did this work with Robert Langlands.

Taylor received his B.A. from Clare College, Cambridge. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1988. From 1995 to 1996 he held the Savilian Chair of Geometry at Oxford University. He was also a Fellow of New College, Oxford. Currently, he is the Herchel Smith Professor of Mathematics at Harvard University.

He received the Whitehead Prize in 1990, the Fermat Prize and the Ostrowski Prize in 2001. He also got the Cole Prize of the American Mathematical Society in 2002, and the Shaw Prize for Mathematics in 2007. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1995.

There are two papers which have the complete proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. One of them was written by Taylor with Andrew Wiles.

In his later work, Taylor (along with Michael Harris) proved the local Langlands conjectures. A simpler proof was suggested almost at the same time by Guy Henniart.

Later, together with Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, and Fred Diamond, he completed proving the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, by performing very difficult computations. 

Recently, Taylor, following the ideas of Michael Harris, developed on his work with Laurent Clozel, Michael Harris, and Nick Shepherd-Barron. He has announced that he proved the Sato–Tate conjecture, for elliptic curves with non-integral j-invariant. This partial proof of the Sato–Tate conjecture uses a theorem of Wiles.

Taylor is married to Christine Taylor . She is a mathematical biologist. They have two children: Jeremy and Chloe. He is also the son of British physicist, John C. Taylor.

Yi Bok-nam

Yi Bok-nam (; born June 28, 1555 in Gangneung - died August 16, 1597 in Namwon) was an army general and politician of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. He was one of Korea's generals in the Imjin War.


Algebraic equation

In mathematics, an algebraic equation, also called polynomial equation over a given field is an equation of the form
where "P" and "Q" are polynomials over that field, and have one (univariate) or more than one (multivariate) variables. For example:
is an algebraic equation over the rational numbers.

Two equations are called equivalent if they have the same set of solutions. This means that all solutions of the second equation must also be solutions of the first one and vice versa. The equation formula_1 is equivalent with formula_4. So the study of algebraic equations is equivalent to the study of polynomials.

If an algebraic equation is over the rationals, it can always be converted to an equivalent one, where all the coefficients are integers. For example, in the equation given above, we multiply by 42 = 2·3·7 and group the terms in the first member. The equation is converted to

The solutions of an equation are the values of the variables for which the equation is true. But for algebraic equations there are also called roots. When solving an equation, we need to say in which set the solutions are allowed. For example, for an equation over the rationals, one can find solutions in the integers. Then, the equation is a diophantine equation. One may also look for solutions in the field of complex numbers. One can also look for solutions in real numbers.

Ancient mathematicians wanted the solutions of univariate equations (that is, equations with one variable) in the form of radical expressions, like formula_6 for the positive solution of formula_7. The ancient Egyptians knew how to solve equations of degree 2 (that is equations in which the highest power of the variable is 2) in this manner. During the Renaissance, Gerolamo Cardano solved the equation of degree 3 and Lodovico Ferrari solved the equation of degree 4. Finally Niels Henrik Abel proved in 1824 that the equation of degree 5 and the equations of higher degree cannot always be solved by using radicals. Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, were introduced to give criteria deciding if an equation is solvable using radicals.

Algebraic solution

An algebraic solution is an algebraic expression which is the solution of an algebraic equation in terms of the coefficients of the variables. It is found only by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the extraction of roots (square roots, cube roots, etc.).

The most well-known example is the solution of the general quadratic equation.

(where "a" ≠ 0).

There is a more complicated solution for the general cubic equation and quartic equation. The Abel-Ruffini theorem states that the general quintic equation does not have an algebraic solution. This means that the general polynomial equation of degree "n", for "n" ≥ 5, cannot be solved by using algebra. However, under certain conditions, we can get algebraic solutions; for example, the equation formula_3 can be solved as formula_4

Derivative (finance)

In finance, a derivative is a special type of contract. In it, the two parties agree to sell (or to buy) certain goods, at a given price, on a given date. Derivatives can be used in two ways. The first is called speculation: One party hopes that the "market price" differs from the "price agreed upon in the contract", so that they can make the difference between the two. The second is called hedging: One party wants to make sure that the market price doesn't go in a direction that would hurt their profits, so they make sure that the price is agreed upon a long time before the transaction takes place. For a seller, hedging means that they can be certain to receive the agreed upon price, and for the buyer, hedging means that they can be certain not to pay more than the agreed upon price. From a moral point of view, speculation is considered a negative activity.

One of the oldest derivatives is rice futures, which have been traded on the Dojima Rice Exchange since the eighteenth century.

Derivatives can take many forms, but some of the most common types are Futures, Contracts for Difference and Options. They can also be structured on a range of different assets including Forex, Equities, Commodities, and interest rates.

The Walking Dead (comics)

The Walking Dead is a monthly comic book series. It tells the story of the travels of Rick Grimes, his family, and other survivors of a zombie apocalypse.

The series was first published in 2003 by Image Comics. It was created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Tony Moore. Moore was replaced by Charlie Adlard from issue #7 forward. Moore still did the art for the covers up to issue #24.)

"The Walking Dead" won the 2010 Eisner Award for "Best Continuing Series" at San Diego Comic-Con International. A television series, "The Walking Dead" was created based on the comic. It was first broadcast on AMC in 2010. The series has been translated into languages such as Portuguese and Spanish.

Rick Grimes was a Atlanta police officer. After being shot by criminals, he wakes from a coma in the hospital to see that his town is overrun with walking dead people. He goes to Atlanta, Georgia to look for his wife and son. Rick finds them in a small camp near the city. The group is being led by Shane. Shane was Rick's partner as a police officer. He helped Lori and Carl get to Atlanta.

After a zombie attack on the camp that caused people to be killed, Rick criticizes Shane. Shane pulls his gun on Rick, but is shot and killed by Rick’s 7-year-old son Carl. Rick, as the new leader of the group, decides the survivors need to find a better place to live.

Rick’s early tries to find a place to live end very badly. A mother is killed after the survivors go into a neighborhood full of zombies. A farmer, Hershel, lets the group stay on his land. They stay there until zombies break free from his barn and kill several members of his family. Things get better when the group finds prison with fences to keep out the zombies.

Rick send a message back to Hershel and his family to come join them at the prison. Rick’s group and four prisoners do what they can to make the prison safe from the zombies. One of the prisoners kills Hershel’s two youngest daughters. Rick kills another of the prisoners when they try to take control of the prison from his group. Because of many problems Rick chooses to not be the group’s leader. He is replaced by a committee.

Rick and two friends, Glenn and Michonne, leave the prison when they see a helicopter crash close to the prison. They find the town of Woodbury. It is a survivor town controlled by an insane tyrant called the Governor. When Rick and his group won't tell him where they came from, the Governor locks them up. He cuts off Rick's right hand and rapes Michonne many times. The Governor lets the three escape. He hopes they can be followed back to where they came from. Before leaving, Michonne attacks the Governor. She tortures him and causes much damage to his body.

The group at the prison get ready for an attack by the people from Woodbury. As time passes and there is no attack for weeks, they start to feel safe. Lori, Rick’s wife, gives birth. Glenn marries his girlfriend Maggie. The two of them “adopt” Sophia, a girl in the group whose mother died. Rick and Hershel are out in the yard looking at their vegetable garden when the Governor and a small army comes to the prison fence.

The group from Woodbury have better weapons and more people but Rick's group kills many of them and they move back away from the prison. Glenn and Maggie think they will attack again. They take Sophia and leave the prison with another family. Michonne and Tyreese are caught while trying to attack Woodbury. Michonne escapes but the Governor kills Tyreese outside the prison gate. He then begins a second attack on the prison.

The Governor’s forces use a tank to break down the fence. Many people in Rick's group are killed in the fighting. These include Hershel, Lori and the baby. Rick and Carl escape from the battle. Zombies move in through the broken fence. They begin to attack the Woodbury forces. One of the Woodbury soldiers shoots the Governor in the head. The people of Woodbury fight on, but there are too many zombies.

Rick and Carl find Michonne and those who left the prison earlier. They soon find three people who are traveling to Washington, D.C. One of them, Eugene, says he is a government scientist. He tells them he is in radio contact with survivors in the capital.

Maggie tries to kill herself after the death of her family. Rick and Abraham go out looking for supplies. Abraham is a U.S. Army sergeant who is traveling with Eugene. The two become friends when they tell each other about the killings they have had to do to survive.

The group’s oldest member, Dale, is bitten by a zombie. He leaves the group in the dark to go into the forest so he can die alone. He is captured by a group of cannibals. They eat his leg before he dies. Rick and the other adults find and kill the cannibals. A reverend is the only person among them who think they way they killed the cannibals was bad.

When they get near Washington, Eugene tells the group that he was actually a high school science teacher and has no contact with the government. Washington is full of zombies like other cities. A man comes to the group and tells them about a peaceful walled-off town of about 40 people. It is called the Alexandria Safe Zone. He takes them to this town.

Rick is worried that the Alexandrians have forgotten how dangerous the world is. He slowly starts to not follow their rules. As town constable, he secretly carries a gun and disobeys Alexandria's leader, Douglas, to stop a domestic dispute. After the newcomers help stop an attack on Alexandria by other survivors, Douglas sees that Rick is a better leader and steps down.

The gunfire during the attack causes a herd of zombies to move toward the town. They break through Alexandria’s wall and begin to kill people. The people hide in their houses while zombies fill the town. Rick, Carl and Alexandria resident Jessie try to escape the town. Jessie is killed by the walkers.

When Rick and Carl are surrounded by zombies, Douglas tries to help them. He accidentally shoots Carl in the eye before being killed. Rick carries Carl to Alexandria’s surgeon. He then goes back outside. Rick, Michonne and other residents destroy the entire herd. This shows Rick that zombies can be dealt with. He decides to rebuild civilization at Alexandria.

Carl wakes from a coma but he does not remember everything that has happened over the past few years.

Rick stops a small rebellion in Alexandria but forgives the rebels.

Andrea tells Rick that she loves him. He does not love her back.

A man named Paul soon comes to the town. He says he is from a nearby community of about 200 people. Paul wants to trade supplies with Alexandria. He tells them that he already does so with several other survivor groups in the area. Rick thinks this may be a trap and captures Paul. He gets Alexandria ready to defend against an attack. Rick soon changes his mind and decides to trade with Paul's group. He tells Andrea that Carl is in the house and asks her to watch him while he is gone. Rick then leaves with Paul and several other to go to Paul's group.


The series is very well liked by critics. It won the Eisner Award for "Best Continuing Series" in 2010. Eric Sunde of IGN comics called it "one of the best monthly comics available". Max Brooks told Kirkman that he read "The Walking Dead" and liked it.

IGN ranked Rick Grimes as the 26th Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time in 2011. They said that Kirkman "has an endless supply of [wringers] to run Rick through." IGN ranked Michonne as the 86th Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time the same year. It ranked the Governor as the 86th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time in 2009. They said that he was "a sadistic evil that "The Road Warrior" forgot." "Wizard" magazine ranked The Governor as the 131st greatest comic book character of all time.

AMC picked up the rights to make a series based on the comic in 2009. It ordered a pilot episode on January 21, 2010. Filming for the series started on May 15, 2010. The series premiered on October 31, 2010. It had very high ratings. On November 8, 2010, after broadcasting two episodes, AMC wanted a second season of "The Walking Dead". This season would have 13 episodes. The second season began on October 16, 2011. Frank Darabont wrote, directed and served as an executive producer until July 25th, 2011. Kirkman and Charles H. Eglee are currently writers and executive producers.

AMC released an animated movie of the first part of Issue #1 of the comic. It was animated by Juice Films. The voices were done by Phil LaMarr and art by Tony Moore.

On February 18, 2011, Telltale Games said they planned to make a video game based on the series. It was scheduled for the fall of 2011, but was not released until April 24th 2012. Kirkman has said that, unlike most zombie games such as "Left 4 Dead", it will focus more on characterization and emotion than action.

The series has so far been collected into the following collections:
The trade paperbacks have six issues in each. They have only the story and no cover art. Each paperback has a three-word title.

All hardcovers have the contents of the comics with the covers. Some have extra material. They are larger than the paperbacks. Each hardcover has two story arcs from the series. Signed versions of the books are available, each limited to 310 pieces.

Limited omnibus editions have 24 issues in a slipcase with several extras. The first volume is signed by Kirkman and Adlard. There are 300 of this edition. Later volumes were released with 3000 pieces each. There is also a deluxe limited edition (signed by Kirkman/Adlard) with 300 pieces available.
These are 48-issue softcover editions. The large books have over a thousand pages. They have no cover art. Compendium One was also released as a limited edition hardcover in 2012 at the Emerald City Comicon and San Diego Comicon with 1000 pieces available.

Mickey

"Mickey" is a song by US singer Toni Basil. It was a top 5 hit when it was released in 1982. It is was covered in 1999 by Lolly, who also had a top 5 hit with the song. The top 10 2005 hit by Gwen Stefani - "Hollaback Girl" and 2012 top 40 hit by Madonna ft Nicki Minaj & MIA - "Give Me All Your Luvin'" also had musical influences from this song, Toni Basil's version was released by Radialchoice and Lolly's version was released by Polydor.
Contrary to popular belief, the song does <nowiki>"not"</nowiki> refer to Mickey Mouse

Hollaback Girl

"Hollaback Girl" is the third single off American singer Gwen Stefani's first solo studio album "Love. Angel. Music. Baby." The song was released on February 8, 2005. the son g priemre dht epromotional single in 2004

Second moment of area

The moment of force (also called the first moment of force) about any point is the product of the force and perpendicular distance between them. If this first moment is again multiplied by the perpendicular distance between them, the product so obtained is called the second moment of force or moment of moment of the force.

If instead of force, the area of the figure or mass of the body is considered, it is called the second moment of area or second moment of mass. They are also termed broadly as moments of inertia.

There is no physical significance for moment of inertia. It is just a mathematical expression usually denoted by formula_1

Denying the correlative

Denying the correlative is a mistake in logic where a person tries to create a third possibility where there are only two. It is based on the concept of correlative conjunctions, pairs of statements where one statement must be true and the other must be false. For example 1. Ginger is a cat. 2. Ginger is not a cat. If a person claims that Ginger is something else than a cat or not a cat, then he is making a logically impossible claim, and denying the correlative. It is the opposite of the false dilemma, which tries to reduce options to only two. Another is if a person were asked if he killed someone and said, "I fought with him". That does not answer the question.

William Smith O'Brien

William Smith O'Brien (; 17 October 1803 – 18 June 1864) was an Irish politician. At one point he was a member of the British Parliament. Later on he was a nationalist and leader of the Young Ireland movement and led a rebellion against British rule in the 1840s during the Potato Famine. He was convicted of treason, a felony, and could have been executed, but he was exiled to Van Diemen's Land instead. In 1856, he was pardoned and allowed to return.

False dilemma

False dilemma, also called the either-or fallacy, us vs. them fallacy, black-or-white fallacy, false dichotomy, or the fallacy of false choice, is a mistake in logic that allows only two possibilities when more than two exist.

For example, there is "either-or fallacy" in saying that an apple must be green or red. The premise is that the apple is either one color or another; but this beginning is a mistake because some apples—not most—are other colors. In other words, most apples are red or green, but some are also yellow.

A "fallacy of false choice" may hide a deliberate attempt to eliminate agreement on an issue. Eldridge Cleaver used this tactic when he said: "You're either part of the solution or part of the problem."

A false dilemma may also be used for comedic effect. Stephen Colbert used this tactic when he asked guests on The Colbert Report: "George Bush... great president or the greatest president?"

Pato

Pato is a game played on horseback. It adds ideas from polo and basketball. It is the national sport of Argentina.

" is Spanish for "duck". The early games used a live duck inside a basket instead of a ball. Pato has been written about since 1610. The playing field would often go between neighboring ranches. The first team to reach its own ranch house with the duck was the winner.

Pato was banned several times during its history. This was due to the violence—not only to the duck; many gauchos were trampled underfoot. Some lost their lives in knife fights started in the heat of the game. In 1796, a Catholic priest said that pato players who died this way should not get Christian burial. Laws saying people could not play pato were common in the 19th century.

During the 1930s, pato had rules added by ranch owner Alberto del Castillo Posse. He made a set of rules based on modern polo. President Juan Perón made pato Argentina's national game in 1953.

In modern pato, two four-member teams ride on horses. They try to get a ball which has six handles. They score by throwing the ball through a ring that is vertical. The rings have a 100 cm (3.3 ft) diameter. They are on 240 cm (7.9 ft) high poles. A closed net, going up for 140 cm (4.6 ft), holds the ball after goals are scored.

The winner is the team with most goals scored after the time is done. Game time is six 8-minute "periods".

The field is: length 180 to 220 m (196.9 to 240.6 yd), width 80 to 90 m (87 to 98 yd). The ball is made of leather, with an inflated rubber chamber and six leather handles. Its diameter is 40 cm (15.7 in) handle-to-handle. The weight is 1050 to 1250 g (2.3 to 2.8 lbs).

The player that has control of the ' (i.e. holds the ball by a handle) must ride with his right arm outstretched. He offers the pato so rival players have a chance of tugging the pato and stealing it. Not holding his arm out while riding with the pato is an offense called ' (refusal).

During the tug itself, or ", both players must stand on the stirrups and not sit on the saddle. The hand not tugging must hold the reins. The tug is usually the most exciting part of the game.

Pato is similar to the game of horseball played in France, Portugal, and other countries.

In 1828, Richard Barrett set up a trading post at Ngamotu after he arrived on the ship "Adventure". Barrett dealt with the local Māori and bought land from them.

The British tried to occupy the area during the early 1840s. But when they arrived, they found an area with few Māori - remaining survivors of a number of inter-tribal wars. At first, land was easily bought but then as time went on, it became more difficult and Europeans wanted more and more of Maori farmland, as Maoris were returning to the area and did not want to sell the land. War finally started in 1860 and lasted for nearly 10 years, resulting in land confiscations by the British government.

The area is known for its dairy farms and its location. It is very close to both sea and mountain, with Mount Taranaki just south of the city. The volcanic cone of Mt Taranaki gives a view of the coastline. Taranaki, which is 2518 metres high, is one of the most climbed mountains in New Zealand. It is one of the places in New Zealand that attracts the most rainfall and the mountain has created a unique environment perfect for plants, alpine herb fields, and native and tropical forest. This attracts many bird species that can be observed in the National Park and surrounding areas.

Today the leadership of the House of Savoy is contested between Victor Emmanuel, Prince of Naples, who is the son on Umberto II, and his cousin Prince Amedeo, Duke of Asota.

There was also a branch of the family that settled in France they were known as the Dukes of Nemours and often had close ties with the Court of Louis XIV. 

From 2006 until his death in 2021, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta was the disputed head of the House of Savoy.


Bourbon Restoration in France

The Bourbon Restoration was the return of the House of Bourbon to France after the French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte. It began in 1814 after Napoleon was defeated and exiled to Elba island off the coast of Italy. Louis XVIII of France, the younger brother of Louis XVI of France, was named king in 1814 by the Congress of Vienna.

After being removed by Napoleon during the Hundred Days, Louis XVIII was returned to power in 1815 and died in 1824. Louis XVIII was succeeded by his younger brother Charles X of France who ruled until he was removed in 1830 by the July Revolution.

Kingdom of the Two Sicilies

The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies () was a kingdom in southern Italy from 1816 until 1861. It was created by Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, after the Congress of Vienna of 1814, by uniting the Kingdom of Sicily and the Kingdom of Naples, which had been ruled by Joseph Bonaparte who conferred the title "Prince of Naples" to be hereditary on his children and grandchildren, during the reign of Napoleon. The ruling dynasty was a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon.

The capital of the kingdom was Naples. Roman Catholicism was the state religion. The kingdom was full of corruption and poverty: mainly because of this, most of the population welcomed the Risorgimento with the unification of southern Italy to the rest of Italy in 1861.

In 1861, Giuseppe Garibaldi and his men, who were known as "red shirts", captured Sicily. This was welcomed by the local population. Garibaldi then crossed the Strait of Messina and captured Naples. South Italy and Sicily then joined the Kingdom of Italy.

The peninsula was divided into fifteen "departments" and the island of Sicily was divided into seven departments. The island itself had a special administrative status, with its base at Palermo.

After the Two Sicilies were conquered by Garibaldi, the departments became provinces of Italy.

For a time the heir to the throne was given the title of "Hereditary Prince of Naples". But this was later changed to the Duke of Calabria after the uniting of the two kingdoms. Collectively the royal family generally lived at the Palace of Caserta. Children of the monarch were born with the style of "Royal Highness" as well as the title of Prince/ss of the Two Sicilies. Several males in the family were given titles such as "Duke of Castro", "Count of Caserta", "Prince of Salerno", a majority of which were lost due to a lack of male heirs. The present pretending monarch is Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria, who does use the title of Duke of Calabria.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The city of Benevento was formally included in this department, but it was occupied by the Papal States and was "de facto" an exclave of that country.

Mer Hayrenik

"Our Fatherland" (, ) is the national anthem of Armenia. The words of the song were written by by Mikael Nalbandian in 1861, and the melody for his words were composed by Barsegh Kanachyan. It is based on a poem called "The Song of an Italian Girl".

The national anthem of Armenia is based on certain parts of the poem "The Song of an Italian Girl". It was first adopted in 1918 as the anthem of the First Republic of Armenia. But when the Soviets invaded their territory and gained control over the country in 1922, the Soviets banned this song and suppressed Armenian nationalism. Instead, the Armenians were forced to have the Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic as a part of their identity, in praise of the Soviet Union. Decades later, late into 1991, the USSR broke up. This anthem was successfully restored, with minor changes to the lyrics.

The original lyrics of the Armenian national anthem is based on the first, third, fourth, and sixth stanzas of "The Song of an Italian Girl". They are quite similar to the current lyrics.

ISO 639-2

ISO 639 is a set of international standards that lists short codes for language names. First there was ISO 639-1. To list more languages, ISO 639-2 was made. Later versions include ISO 639-3 and ISO 639-5.

Each language has a 3 letter code. The list below shows all the codes in ISO 639-2.

The following is a complete list of three-letter ISO 639-2 codes. Where two ISO 639-2 codes are given in the table, the one with the asterisk is the bibliographic code (B code) and the other is the terminological code (T code).

Entries in the "Notes" column show:

ISO 639-3

The ISO 639-3 is the third version of a set of international standards that lists short codes for language names. Such codes are also known as language codes. Before this version was out, there was already ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2, but due to the increase in languages being added to the database, ISO639-3 was therefore released, and all language codes have three letters, unlike the previous two, which allowed two letters in the code.

Each known language has a 3 letter code, and requests to add additional languages into the database can be made at the SIL International website. The standard was published by ISO on 2007-02-05.


Vehicle registration plate

A vehicle registration plate is a metal or plastic plate on a motor vehicle or trailer. It is used for official identification purposes.

In other countries, it is unique in a state or province. Sometimes the identifier is for a person and sometimes for a vehicle. Each country calls a vehicle registration plate something different. Some examples are license plate or tag (US), licence plate (Canada), number plate or registration plate (UK).

Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)

The Kingdom of Armenia also known as Greater Armenia (Armenian: Մեծ Հայք, Mets Hayk), was an Armenian kingdom ruling in the Ancient Near East from 321 BC to 428 AD. It's history is divided into reigns by three royal dynasties: Orontid (321 BC–200 BC), Artaxiad (190 BC–12 AD) and Arsacid (52 AD–428 AD). 

The Kingdom of Armenia was ruled by the Orontid (also known as Yervanduni or Eurandids) dynasty from 321 BC to 200 BC. The Orontids (Eurandids) were an Armenian dynasty of probably Iranian origin. Around 200 BC a coup by the Armenian noble family of Artaxias toppled the Orontid (Yervanduni) dynasty, Thus the Artaxiad dynasty came to power, as depending on the Seleucids. The Artaxiad dynasty was been identified as a branch of the Orontid (Eurandid) dynasty. The Seleucid Empire's influence over Armenia had weakened after it was defeated by the Romans in the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. A Hellenistic Armenian state was thus founded in the same year by Artaxias I alongside the Armenian kingdom of Sophene led by Zariadres. Artaxias seized Yervandashat, united the Armenian Highlands at the expense of neighboring tribes and founded the new royal capital of Artaxata near the Araxes River. After the defeat of Antiochus III the Great at the hands of the Romans, in 188 BC, both Artaxias and Zariadres established themselves as Kings, with Artaxias ruling over the former lands of the Armenia Strategia, while Zariadres continues his rule over Sophene. The new city was laid on a strategic position at the juncture of trade routes that connected the Ancient Greek world with Bactria, India and the Black Sea which permitted the Armenians to prosper.

Tigranes the Great 

After the death of Mithridates II of Parthia his son Gotarzes I succeeded him. He reigned during a period coined in scholarship as the "Parthian Dark Age," due to the lack of clear information on the events of this period in the empire, except a series of, apparently overlapping, reigns. This system of split monarchy weakened Parthia, allowing Tigranes II of Armenia to annex Parthian territory in western Mesopotamia. This land would not be restored to Parthia until the reign of Sinatruces ("r". c. 78–69 BC). In 83 BC, after bloody strife for the throne of Syria, governed by the Seleucids, the Syrians decided to choose Tigranes as the protector of their kingdom and offered him the crown of Syria. He then conquered Phoenicia and Cilicia, effectively putting an end to the last remnants of the Seleucid Empire, though a few holdout cities appear to have recognized the shadowy boy-king Seleucus VII Philometor as the legitimate king during his reign. The southern border of his domain reached as far as Ptolemais. Many of the inhabitants of conquered cities were sent to his new metropolis of Tigranocerta.
Under reign of Tigranes the Great, Kingdom of Armenia stretched from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean and the Kingdom of Armenia was called the "Armenian empire" during her reign. At one time, the domains of Tigranes the Great stretched from the shores of the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean, from Mesopotamia up to the Pontic Alps. The vast empire, formed of a varied mixture of diverse tribes, with their own dialects and cultures, could hardly be turned over- night into a cohesive and durable political structure. Inner disunity aided the designs of the Romans, who launched a series of onslaughts on the Armenian dynasty, beginning with the invasion by Lucullus in 69–8 B.C, and culminating in the campaigns of Pompey in Armenia, Iberia and Colchis in 66–5 B.C. The downfall of Tigranes the Great was precipitated by the flight of his son, Tigranes the Younger, to the court of the Parthian king Phraates III, who supplied him with an army with which to invade Armenia, and join forces with the victorious Romans. Armenia became a Roman client kingdom in 66 BC, after the final defeat of Armenia's ally, Mithridates VI of Pontus by Pompey at the Battle of the Lycus.

Approximately half a century after the collapse of the Artaxiad dynasty Armenia was under the rule of the Arshakunis, the Armenian branch of the Parthian Arsacids. Next, in 314, under King Tiridates (Trdat) the Great and through the apostolate of St. Gregory the Illuminator, Armenia, nearly simultaneously with the Roman empire, officially accepted Christianity, a turning point in its history. An event of importance in the Arshakuni period was the invention, on the threshold of the fifth century, of the Armenian alphabet by St. Mesrop. With this Armenian became the language of the educated; it was introduced into the liturgy; and national literature was born (under Hellenistic and Syrian influences). Armenia’s identity and individuality were thus saved and an absorption by either Byzantine or Iranian civilization was precluded.
The Arsacid dynasty was overthrown by the Sasanid Empire in 428, and this was the end of the Kingdom of Armenia.

During the Orontid period, despite the Hellenistic invasion of Persia, Persian and local Armenian culture remained the strongest element within society and the elites. While the culture of Armenia was dominated by Hellenism under the Artaxiads, the reign of the Arsacids marked the predominance of Iranianism in the country, with Parthian replacing Greek as the language of the educated. However, Armenian Hellenism was not eradicated, as the Arsacids of Iran were proud philhellenes. Armenian was considered a "vulgar" language, and thus Parthian language was spoken amongst the upper class and at the court. It was during this period that Classical Armenian incorporated most of its Iranian loanwords. However, with the invention of the Armenian alphabet, Armenian became the language of the educated people; introduced into liturgy and national literature was born. 

Until the late Parthian period, Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land. With the advent of Christianity, both paganism and Zoroastrianism gradually started to diminish. The founder of the Arsacid branch in Armenia, Tiridates I was a Zoroastrian priest or magus. A noted episode which illustrates the observance by the Armenian Arsacids is the famous journey of Tiridates I to Rome in A.D. 65–66. With the adoption of Christianity in the early 4th century, Zoroastrianism's influence in the kingdom gradually started to decline.

LGBT rights in Thailand

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Thailand may face legal challenges that non-LGBT residents don't have to. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Thailand. Same-sex couples and families headed by same-sex couples cannot get the same legal protections that opposite-sex couples can. 

Thai LGBT people "still [in 2014,] face discrimination affecting their social rights and job opportunities"; they also "face difficulty gaining acceptance for non-traditional sexuality, even though the tourism authority has been promoting Thailand as a gay-friendly country".

In May 2009, the Thai Red Cross reaffirmed its ban of men who have sex with males (MSM) becoming blood donors, despite campaigns to change this policy. Gender-Reassignment Operations have been performed in Thailand since 1975, and Thailand is among the most popular destinations globally for patients seeking Gender-Reassignment Operations.

LGBT rights in Myanmar

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) people in Myanmar face legal challenges and discrimination not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Same-sex sexual activity is illegal within the Union of Myanmar and punishable by fines and imprisonment for ten years to life. The past authoritarian nature of the government made it difficult to obtain accurate information about the legal or social status of LGBT citizens of Myanmar. However, along with the ongoing political reforms, improvements in media and civil freedoms have allowed LGBT people to gain more and more recognition in the country.

During the Military regime, no organised Bangladeshi LGBT political or social life was able to exist. Burma's social mores about human sexuality have been described as being "extremely conservative." Aung Myo Min is an openly gay man and has been involved in the All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF). In 2005 he talked about his coming out process and the homophobia that exists, even with the pro-democracy opposition. Today he is involved with exile Burma human rights organizations, including the Campaign for Lesbian Gay Rights in Burma. In 2003, Focus Asia (Star TV) aired a story about the Nat Kadaws. The "Utopia Guide to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar & Vietnam" references "Transgender shaman channelling spirits at Myanmar sacred festivals." Yet, within Burma itself, no formal gay bars or LGBT human rights organisations exist as of yet. There are only some unconfirmed reports that certain nightclubs in the cities that are a reputation for both heterosexual and LGBT clientele. Burma also celebrated its first gay pride in several cities around the country in 2012, to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia.

U.S. state

In the United States, a state is a political entity. There are currently 50 of them, and they are bound together in a federation. Each has a government and can make laws over a particular area that the state covers. All states have a shared sovereignty with the U.S. federal government. People who were born or naturalized in states are citizens of both the United States and the state they are in.People can move between states without asking or saying so, unless a court has said they can't. Four states call themselves "commonwealths" in their official names. Washington, D.C. is a federal district and not a state nor in a state.

States divide their territory into counties, or something similar with different name, which are not sovereign. Most states give their counties some government authority; a few states give them none. State governments get their power from the people of that state. States have a number of States' rights under the United States Constitution. States and the people that live in them are represented in the United States Congress, in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state also selects electors (an equal number to the number of Senators and Representatives from that state) to vote in the Electoral College, which elects the President of the United States. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, is considered as a possible 51st state for the future.

University of Paris-Seine

University of Paris-Seine is a group of higher education institutes in France. It groups public universities and national research centers. These places teach nearly every field of sciences (fundamental, engineering, business).

The "Université du grand ouest parisien" was created on 6 February 2012.
The name has changed the 1st of March 2015. It is now called « Université Paris-Seine ».

Common barn owl

The common barn owl ("Tyto alba") is a species of owl in the genus "Tyto". It is the most widely distributed species of owl, and one of the most widespread of all birds. The barn owl family Tytonidae is one of two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical owls (Strigidae). It is known by many other names in different parts of the world, which is one of the problems with 'common names'. It is one of the main reasons Linnaeus invented his system of scientific naming.

This owl has long wings, a pale face, and a square-shaped tail. It lives in rural areas like farms and woodland. The barn owl has a wing span of 75–110 cm and its body length measures up to around 25–50 cm. It weighs between 187 and 800 grams.

Barn owls' breeding season is spring and it breeds in nests in trees. It eats small mammals, reptiles, fish, insects and smaller birds.

"Tyto alba" is nocturnal, as usual for owls. However, it often becomes active shortly before dusk and can sometimes be seen during the day, when it moves from a sleeping place it does not like.

This is a bird of open country such as farmland or grassland with some interspersed woodland. This owl prefers to hunt along the edges of woods. It has an effortless wavering flight as it moves over pastures or similar hunting grounds. Like most owls, the Barn Owl flies silently; tiny serrations on the leading edges of its flight feathers help to break up the flow of air over its wings, thereby reducing turbulence and the noise that accompanies it.

It hunts by flying low and slowly over an area of open ground, hovering over spots that conceal potential prey. They may also use fence posts or other lookouts to ambush prey. The Barn Owl feeds primarily on small vertebrates such as rodents.

Studies have shown that an individual Barn Owl may eat one or more rodents per night; a nesting pair and their young can eat more than 1,000 rodents per year. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up most of the prey. Such animals probably make up at least three-quarters of the biomass eaten by each and every "T. alba", except in some island populations. In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the Bank vole in the 1950s has led to a major shift in the Barn Owl's diet: where their ranges overlap the vole is now by far the largest prey item. The diet is supplemented with local small vertebrate and large invertebrate life.

North American river otter

The North American river otter ("Lontra canadensis"), or the common otter, is an aquatic mammal native to only North America in the countries Canada, and the United States. River otters are a distant relative of the weasel family. North American river otters can reach a length of 3.9 ft and weigh 3 lbs. The river otter's life expectancy is 10 to 15 years in the wild and 25 years in captivity. The main habitat of the river otter are near freshwater rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, marshes, swamps, and coastal waters. They prefer fish, though they will eat amphibians such as frogs, turtles, and crayfish. They have also been reported to eat small mammals and birds.

About 290 North American river otters are currently in captivity.

Monarchy of Australia

The Monarchy of Australia is a form of government in which a hereditary monarch is the sovereign of Australia according to the rules of the Australian Constitution.

This means that the job of King or Queen of Australia passes down through the Royal Family. When the King or Queen dies, the job passes to their son, daughter or next in line to the throne. As monarch of Australia, they then have ceremonial and constitutional duties as part of the government of Australia. The Governor General of Australia does the work of the monarch for the national Government. State Governors do the work of the monarch for State Governments of Australia.

The British First Fleet of convict ships arrived at Sydney in 1788 and New South Wales became a Crown Colony, with King George III of England as its King. The British set up other colonies all around Australia with powerful colonial governors chosen by Britain. From the 1820s, these colonies began to get more and more self-government and from the 1850s they began to become parliamentary democracies, which kept the Kings and Queens of the United Kingdom as their Heads of State, with royal duties done by Colonial Governors who had less and less real power.

In 1901, after a vote, the British colonies of Australia decided to become one country, with a constitutional monarchy with Queen Victoria as the monarch. The Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George V) opened the first Parliament of Australia in 1901 and the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) opened the first Parliament in Canberra in 1927.

The Balfour Declaration of 1926, changed the situation in the British Empire, so that United Kingdom and the Dominions (like Australia, Canada and New Zealand) were to be seen as equal and independent, but "united by a common allegiance to the Crown". This situation of independent monarchies was confirmed by the Statute of Westminster. The Curtin Labor Government chose Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester (the brother of King George VI), as Governor-General during the Second World War.

Queen Elizabeth II became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia in 1954, greeted by huge crowds across the nation. Her son Prince Charles went to school in Australia in 1967. Her grandson Prince Harry lived in Australia for some of his gap-year in 2003.

The Royal family was very popular for most of the 20th Century - but by the 1990s, some politicians and lots of people wanted Australia to become a republic. In 1999, the country had a referendum to become a republic, but the people chose to keep the Australian monarchy instead of changing to a republic.

At the moment, the monarch of Australia is King Charles III. He holds the title after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The late Queen reigned as the Queen of Australia since 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022. The King is represented in Australia by the Governor-General. The Governor-General does the work of the Queen in Australia and follows the rules of the Australian Constitution. He or she is chosen by the Prime Minister and appointed by the monarch.

In each of the States of Australia, the monarch is represented by a Governor. The Governors are appointed by the King after the state premiers tell Him their choice.

The Australian monarch is also monarch of fifteen other Commonwealth countries known as Commonwealth realms: including Great Britain, New Zealand, Canada and Papua New Guinea.

The Governor General is chosen by the Prime Minister and is appointed by the monarch to act as Head of State. The Governor General cannot behave like a politician or member of a political party, but must do the work of the monarch in Australia. The Governor General does things like opening parliament, and giving out awards on Australia Day. After elections, or when a government loses or wins a majority in the Australian House of Representatives, the Governor General is the person who legally decides that the prime minister has the numbers to lead a government.

Some Governor-Generals belonged to the Royal Family and for a long time they all came from Britain, but for many years all Governor Generals have been Australians.

Australian Senate

The Senate is the upper house of the Parliament of Australia. The lower house is the House of Representatives. Senators are elected for a term that is usually six years. But some senators have three year terms. The Senate has a lot of power from the Australian Constitution.

There are currently 76 people in the Senate.

Australian House of Representatives

The House of Representatives is the lower house of the Parliament of Australia. The upper house is the Senate. Members of Parliament (MPs) serve for terms of about three years. There are 151 members. Each member represents one electorate. The number of electorates is figured out so that it is in proportion to the population of each state/territory. and so that each one has roughly the same population. This is determined by the AEC (Australian Electoral Commission).

Automatic rifle

Usually, an automatic rifle is a rifle that continuously fires bullet as long as the trigger is pressed. Cartridge shells are ejected and new cartridges are loaded into the chamber automatically. However, most automatic rifles are designed to give both semi- and fully automatic fire. This is called selective fire. They also rifle bullets from a magazine. These features makes them different from other automatic firearms like the machine gun and submachine gun.

Soldiers in the United States Army who carry the M249 SAW are called "automatic riflemen". The weapon is also called an "automatic rifle". However, it is a fully automatic firearm. These are normally called squad automatic weapons (SAW) or light machine guns.

An assault rifle is quite similar to an automatic rifle. However, it uses less powerful bullets than the machine gun or battle rifle. This allows the soldier using it to control the recoil of the weapon without using a bipod or something similar. Bullets like these are called "intermediate" bullets. For example, the AK-47 assault rifle often uses a 7.62x39mm bullet. The bullet is the same diameter. However, it is smaller and less powerful compared to the 7.62x54mmR. The 7.62x54mmR was what was being used with rifles when the AK-47 was brought in to service.

The very first automatic rifle was the Mexican Mondragón rifle. It was designed by General Manuel Mondragón. He began working on the weapon in 1882. He patented it in 1887. In the 20th century, automatic rifles go back to World War I. This is where the Browning Automatic Rifle (B.A.R.) and Huot were first used. They were supposed to be used like light machine guns to help soldiers attack. However, only the Mondragón rifle and the B.A.R. were used in World War I.

Telephone numbers in Australia

Country Code: +61<br>
International Call Prefix: 0011<br>
Trunk Prefix: 0

The Australian telephone numbering plan is how phone numbers work in Australia. It has changed many times. The most recent major change was between 1994 and 1998.

Australia is divided geographically into four large area codes. The standard telephone number in Australia has ten digits. The first digit is '0'.

The first digits are for the type of service. The following list is a high level of numbering plan presented in domestic format. Geographical region boundaries do not exactly follow state borders.

The Kingdom (Elgar)

The Kingdom, Op. 51, is an oratorio for soloists, chorus and orchestra composed by Edward Elgar.

It was first performed at the Birmingham Music Festival on 3 October 1906, with the orchestra conducted by the composer, and soloists Agnes Nicholls, Muriel Foster, John Coates and William Higley.

Elgar thought for a long time about the idea of writing an oratorio about the apostles. He decided in the end to write not just one, but three oratorios (a “trilogy”). The first one was to be about the apostles being called to follow Jesus. This one was called "The Apostles" and was composed and performed in 1903. The second one was to be about the apostles being persecuted. This one, first performed in 1906, was given the title The Kingdom. The third one was going to be about the Last Judgement. Elgar never got round to composing it, although he thought about it as late as the 1920s.

Elgar prepared the words of "The Kingdom" himself. He describes events from the Acts of the Apostles, and he also put in lines from the Gospels, the Old Testament and the Apocrypha.

A lot of the music is calm and thoughtful rather than dramatic. If Elgar had completed all three oratorios, "The Kingdom" would have been the middle one: quiet and relective between two more dramatic ones. As in "The Apostles" , Elgar used the idea of the Leitmotif. This is something that Richard Wagner had developed in his operas: the technique of having short tunes (motifs) which represent particular characters or events in the story.

The oratorio is divided into a prelude which is played by the orchestra, and five parts.

"The Kingdom" is written for a large orchestra. There is a double chorus (the choir split into 8 parts) with semichorus, and four soloists who represent The Blessed Virgin (soprano), Mary Magdalene (contralto), St John (tenor), and St Peter (bass).

In the orchestral prelude we first hear tunes (motives) which we heard in "The Apostles". There are motifs which represent Jesus’ sadness, and one for Peter, another one representing the new faith, Christ the Redeemer and the prelude ends by hearing these last two at the same time.

Part I is about the Apostles and Holy Women meeting after Christ’s Ascension. Matthew is chosen to take Judas’ place.

Part II is quite short. Mary (Christ’s mother) and Mary Magdalene are talking about a lame man and remembering how Jesus healed the blind and the lame.

Part III is about the Pentecost. This is when the Holy Spirit came down and gave the apostles the ability to speak all languages so that they could tell everybody in the world about Jesus. Peter tells everybody that they should be baptised in the Name of the Lord.

Part IV John sings a big duet with Peter. They preach to the crowd about Jesus’s resurrection, so they get arrested. After their arrest Mary prays for the two men (this is not in the Bible, it was Elgar’s idea).

Part V The opening chorus is heard in a different form. The Apostles and Holy Women take communion and sing the Lord's Prayer. Christ the Redeemer appears, and the work finishes with the theme of the new faith. The music does not end in a loud burst of glory, but quietly and peacefully.

Statute of Westminster 1931

The Statute of Westminster 1931 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was passed on 11 December 1931. The Act gave equality to the self-governing dominions of the British Empire. It is still law in each of the Commonwealth realms.

The Statute is important because it gave legislative freedom to these countries. Its current relevance is that it sets the basis for the continuing relationship between the Commonwealth realms and the Crown.

Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942

The Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 is an Act of the Australian Parliament. They formally accepted the Statute of Westminster 1931. It happened on 9 October 1942.

The Act is more important for its symbolic value than for the legal effect of its provisions. Australia was becoming more independent from the United Kingdom. This Statute showed the independence to the world.

Australia Act 1986

The Australia Act 1986 is the name of a pair of separate but related pieces of legislation. One was an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. The other was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. These nearly identical Acts were passed by the two parliaments because no one knew which one had the power to do so.

The "Australia Act" ended the possibility for the UK to make laws for Australia. Also the UK could not be involved in Australian government. And no one could appeal from any Australian court to a British court.

Botany Bay

Botany Bay is a bay in Sydney, New South Wales. It is a few kilometres south of the Sydney central business district. The Cooks River and the Georges River are the two major tributaries that flow into the bay. Two runways of Sydney Airport extend into the bay.

On 29 April 1770, Botany Bay was the site of James Cook's first landing of HMS "Endeavour" on the continent of Australia. Later the British planned Botany Bay as the site for a penal colony. Out of these plans came the first European to live in Australia at Sydney Cove.

Aboriginal lived in this area dating back 5,000 years. The Aboriginal people of Sydney were known as the Eora.

Even though it is a busy port, there are many types of marine life. The area around its entrance is some of the best scuba diving in the Sydney area. The world's largest population of weedy sea dragon found was on the southern side.

Corroboree

A corroboree is a ceremonial meeting of Aboriginal Australians. The word was made by the European settlers of Australia. It was an imitation of the Eora word "caribberie". At a corroboree, Aborigines interact with the Dreamtime through dance, music and costume. Many ceremonies act out events from the Dreamtime. Many of the ceremonies are sacred. People from outside a community cannot participate or watch.

Blue Mountains (New South Wales)

The Blue Mountains is a region in New South Wales, Australia. The foothills start about west of the state capital, Sydney. The area begins on the west side of the Nepean River. It goes west as far as Coxs River. The Blue Mountains is an Australian natural wonder and World Heritage-listed area.

It is mainly a sandstone plateau. The highest point of the range is Mount Werong. It is above sea level. A large part of the Blue Mountains is in the Greater Blue Mountains Area World Heritage Site. The area has seven national park areas and a conservation reserve.

The Blue Mountains area includes the local government areas of the City of Blue Mountains, the City of Hawkesbury, the City of Lithgow and Oberon.

The Greater Blue Mountains Area has over 400 different forms of animals. Among them are rare mammal species like Spotted-tailed Quoll, the Koala, the yellow-bellied Glider, and Long-nosed Potoroo. There are also some rare reptiles, like the Blue Mountain Water Skink. There are also some dingos in the area. They are the top predators and hunt for grey kangaroos.

Watchdog

A watchog or watch dog can have several meanings:

Gregory Blaxland

Gregory Blaxland (17 June 1778 – 1 January 1853) was a pioneer farmer and explorer in Australia.

Gregory Blaxland was born 17 June 1778 at Fordwich, Kent, England. He was the fourth son of John Blaxland, mayor from 1767 to 1774. His mother was Mary, daughter of Captain Parker, R.N. Gregory attended The King's School, Canterbury. In July 1799 he married Elizabeth, daughter of John Spurdon. They had five sons and two daughters.

The Blaxlands were friends of Sir Joseph Banks. Banks influenced Gregory and his older brother, John, to move from England. The government promised them land, convict servants and free passages. Gregory sailed in the William Pitt on 1 September 1805 with his wife, three children, two servants, an overseer, a few sheep, seed, bees, tools, groceries and clothing. When he reached Sydney he sold many of these goods for a good amount of money. He bought eighty head of cattle. 

In 1813, he led the first known European trip across the Blue Mountains. He went along with William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth. Their trip opened up the inland of the continent.

Blaxland visited England and in February 1823 he published his "Journal Of A Tour Of Discovery Across The Blue Mountains". Later the same year Blaxland was awarded the silver medal of the Royal Society of Arts for some wine he had sent to London. Five years later he got the gold medal. In January 1827 Blaxland was elected by a public meeting with two others to ask Governor Darling for "Trial by jury" and "Taxation by Representation" for the colony.

Blaxland is noted as one of the first settlers to plant grapes for wine-making purposes. 

He died by his own hand in 1 January 1853 in New South Wales. He is buried in All Saints Cemetery in Parramatta.

The township of Blaxland in the Blue Mountains is named after him. So is the Division of Blaxland.

In 1963 he was honoured, together with Lawson and Wentworth, on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post showing the Blue Mountains crossing.

Romeo Smith has a boat on Home and away called the Blaxland.

Watchdog timer

A watchdog timer is a component of an electronic system that makes sure the system is operating properly. These components can either be done as a piece of hardware or as software. Depending on the intended use, they either signal that a system is not working properly, or they make a system work properly again. A watchdog timer may cause a system to reset itself to its initial state.

William Lawson

William Lawson may mean:

William Lawson (explorer)

William Lawson (2 June 1774 – 16 June 1850) was an explorer of New South Wales, Australia. He helped discover a passage inland through the Blue Mountains from Sydney.

Lawson was born in Finchley, Middlesex, England. He is the son of Scottish parents. Lawson came to Sydney as an ensign with the New South Wales Corps in November 1800. He was soon posted to Norfolk Island.

After 1808, Lawson was appointed aide-de-camp to George Johnston. He was given 500 acres (2 km²) at Prospect. He built a 40-room mansion there.

In 1813 Lawson, with Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, led a trip west from Sydney to cross the Blue Mountains. 

They left on 11 May 1813 with four servants, five dogs and four horses. The route they travelled is still the one used by travellers today. On 31 May 1813 they reached Mount Blaxland and could see the plains to the west. 

Lawson was rewarded with a grant of 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land. He ended up one of the largest land-holders in Australia. He was made a magistrate and was appointed commandant at Newcastle. 

In 1819 Governor Lachlan Macquarie made a new settlement, Bathurst. He made Lawson commander of the Bathurst settlement. Lawson had this job until 1823. From Bathurst, Lawson explored as far north as Mudgee. 

After leaving the army, Lawson was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1843 to 1848. He died at Veteran Hall on 16 June 1850. The town of Lawson in the Blue Mountains is named for him.

In 1963 Lawson was honoured, together with Blaxland and Wentworth, on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post showing the Blue Mountains crossing. 

William Wentworth

William Charles Wentworth (13 August 1790 – 20 March 1872) was an Australian poet, explorer, journalist and politician. He was one of the leading figures of early colonial New South Wales. He was the first native-born Australian to get a reputation overseas. He wanted self-government for the Australian colonies.

In 1796 Wentworth arrived in Sydney. It was then a poor prison settlement. The family lived at Parramatta. His father became a prosperous landowner. In 1802 he was sent to England. He went to a school in London. He returned to Sydney in 1810. He was appointed acting Provost-Marshall by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. He was given a land grant of on the Nepean River.

On 15 October 1810, at Hyde Park, Wentworth won the first official horse races on Australian soil.

In 1813 Wentworth, along with Gregory Blaxland and William Lawson, led the trip which found a route across the Blue Mountains. The town of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains is named for him. As a reward he was given another .

Wentworth returned to England in 1816. There he was admitted to the bar, travelled in Europe, and studied at Cambridge University.

In 1819 Wentworth published the first book written by an Australian: "A Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen's Land, With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America". He said there should be an elected assembly for New South Wales, trial by jury and settlement of Australia by free emigrants rather than convicts.

Wentworth successfully completed his legal studies by 1822 and was called to the bar. In 1823 he was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge. That year he also published an epic poem "Australasia", which contains lines now famous in Australia:

Wentworth returned to Sydney in 1824. He was joined by Robert Wardell. His father died in 1827 and William inherited his property. This made him one of the wealthiest men in the colony.

Wentworth became Vice-President of the Australian Patriotic Association and founded a newspaper, "The Australian". It was the colony's first privately owned paper.

He was elected to the Council in 1843 and soon became the leader of the conservative party. He was against the liberals led by Charles Cowper. In 1853 Wentworth chaired the committee to draft a new constitution for New South Wales. In 1856 Wentworth retired from the Council and settled in England.

He died in England, but at his request his body was returned to Sydney for burial.

The towns of Wentworth and Wentworth Falls, the federal Division of Wentworth, an electorate in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs, the Wentworth Falls waterfall, and Wentworth Avenue which runs through the suburb of Kingston in Canberra, were named after him.

In 1963 he was honoured, together with Blaxland and Lawson, on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post showing the Blue Mountains crossing. Another stamp was issued again in 1974 on the anniversary of the first newspaper publication.

The Wentworth Building, where University of Sydney Union resides, was named after William Wentworth.


Battleship

A battleship is a kind of large warship. It has metal armour and has large (heavy caliber) guns. Battleships are larger, better armed and armored than cruisers and destroyers. Battleships were mainly around from about 1880 to the 1940s, though some were still used as late as the Gulf War in 1991. For most of this time, battleships were the most powerful and most expensive kind of warship. Today some battleships are still around but these are museums.

In the 19th century, different countries tried to build bigger and better warships. One of the first ships with iron armor was called "Gloire", from 1859. This ship had both sails and a steam engine which drove a propellor, as well as guns the fired explosive shells. This was a kind of ship called an ironclad. A few years later, ironclads were used in the American Civil War.

Britain and France kept trying to build warships that were better than each other. Later in the 19th century other countries like Germany, Russia, Japan, Italy and the United States also built many battleships. Different countries used new inventions to make their ships more powerful, with things like steel armour, rifled guns, and better kinds of steam engine. By around 1890 people started to call their best ships 'battleships' instead of 'ironclads'. Many people, including many Admirals and politicians, thought battleships were very important. If there was a war, the country with the best battleships would win, by sinking the other side's navy and stopping them bringing food and goods into their country (called a blockade). But battleships were also very expensive, and other people thought it was better to spend the money on a better army, or things like pensions for old people. 

In 1906, Britain made a new kind of battleship called HMS Dreadnought. Though this ship was not much bigger, it had steam turbine engines which made it faster. All of its guns were also very large, which meant it could damage other battleships more from further away. People claimed one ship like Dreadnought could beat two earlier battleships, even battleships made just a few years before. Soon many countries were building ships like this, and calling them 'Dreadnoughts'.

Many battleships were used in the First World War. However, battleships were so important and expensive that neither side wanted to take a chance of losing a battle with them. There were several battles with battleships. The biggest one was the Battle of Jutland which involved dozens of battleships and hundreds of smaller ships. But none of the battles made much difference. Submarines made a bigger difference to the war, even though less people had expected them to. At the end of the War, Germany was made to hand over all their battleships to Britain. However, the German navy sank ("scuttled") their own battleships rather than give them to the British. In 1922, most countries which had big navies signed a treaty called the Washington Naval Treaty which meant no-one would build new battleships for at least 10 years.

Battleships were also important at the start of World War II. But by the middle of World War II, battleships had become less important than aircraft carriers. Aircraft carriers had dozens of airplanes which could drop bombs or torpedos. Even though battleships had thicker armour than ever, several hits from bombs or torpedos would still sink a battleship. The planes could fly much further than a battleship's guns could shoot. There were some important battles between battleships in World War II, but more often battleships were less important than aircraft carriers. At battles like the Battle of Taranto and the Battle of Pearl Harbour many battleships were sunk by planes.

After World War II there was not much point to a battleship. Aircraft carriers had become even better, because of jet aircraft and missiles. Also, even a heavily armored battleship could be sunk by a nuclear bomb. Even so the United States Navy kept a few battleships during the Cold War. The very big guns on a battleship were still useful to shoot at shore targets if there was an invasion from the sea. American battleships were also given new weapons like guided missiles to make them more useful if there was a war with Russia. However, only the United States could afford to keep battleships like this. No-one else did. Some American battleships shot at Iraq in the Gulf War. This was the last time when any battleships fought. The United States kept battleships until 2004, when the last ones were made into museums.

Ray Guy

William Ray Guy (December 22, 1949 – November 3, 2022) is a retired American football punter for the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders. Coming from the University of Southern Mississippi, he was the only pure punter ever to be selected in the first round of the NFL Draft when the Oakland Raiders selected him in 1973. He won three Super Bowls with the Oakland Raiders also.

On August 2, 2014, Guy was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and became the second pure kicker (after Jan Stenerud) and the first pure punter to be inducted.


Punt

In some rules of football, a punt is a play in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it touches the ground. A punt is in contrast to a drop kick, in which the ball touches the ground before being kicked.

In American and Canadian football, the ball is kicked downfield to the opposing team, usually on the final down, with the hope of giving the receiving team a field position that is more helpful to the kicking team when possession changes.

Drop kick

A drop kick is a type of kick in various rules of football. It involves a player dropping the ball and then kicking it when it bounces off the ground. It contrasts to a punt, wherein the player kicks the ball without letting it hit the ground first.

Single (baseball)

A single is when the batter safely reaches first base by hitting a fair ball and getting to first base before a fielder puts him out. As an exception, a batter-runner reaching first base safely is not credited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another runner on the first play; this is one type of a fielder's choice. Also, a batter-runner reaching first base on a play due to a fielder's error trying to put him out at first base or another runner out (as a fielder's choice) is not credited with a single.



Fair ball

In baseball, a fair ball is a batted ball that gives the batter to attempt to reach first base. In order for a batted ball to be fair, it must be hit in such a way that it:


Error (baseball)

In baseball statistics, an error, abbreviated E and then the defensive positional designation, is the act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to reach one or more additional bases, when such an advance would have been prevented given ordinary effort by the fielder.

An error does not count as a hit but still counts as an at bat for the batter unless, in the scorer's judgment, the batter would have reached first base safely but one or more of the additional base(s) reached was the result of the fielder's mistake. In that case, the play will be scored both as a hit (for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to) "and" an error. However, if a batter is judged to have reached base solely because of a fielder's mistake, it is scored as a "hit on error," and treated the same as if a batter was put out, which would lower his batting average.

Similarly, a batter does not receive credit for an RBI when runs score on an error, unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake. For example, if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a sacrifice fly and the outfielder drops the ball for an error, the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the run batted in.

If a play should have resulted in a fielder's choice with a runner being put out and the batter reaching base safely but the runner is safe due to an error, the play will be scored as a fielder's choice, with no hit being awarded to the batter and an error charged against the fielder.

Passed balls and wild pitches are separate statistical categories and are not scored as errors.

Official scorer

In the game of baseball, the official scorer is a person appointed by the league to record the events on the field, and to send the official scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner's advance around the bases, the official scorer is also charged with making judgment calls that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in certain situations, and wild pitches, all of which are included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of the official scorer's game record.

Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo

Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo is an American ballet company of men who dance in drag. The company makes fun of romantic and classical ballet.

Now though, it celebrates all "who served and died in all wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations" and "the contribution and suffering of all those who have served." 

Anzac Day is also observed in the Cook Islands, Niue, Pitcairn, and Tonga. In the past, it was a national holiday in Papua New Guinea or Samoa.

Tom Roberts

Thomas William "Tom" Roberts (9 March 1856 – 14 September 1931) was an Anglo-Australian artist. He was an important member of the Heidelberg School.

Roberts parents were newspaper editors. The family moved to Australia in 1869. They lived in Collingwood. He worked as a photographer's assistant through the 1870s. He studied art at night under Louis Buvelot. He became friends with Frederick McCubbin. He returned to England for three years of full-time art study at the Royal Academy Schools from 1881 to 1884.

Through the 1880s and 1890s he worked in Victoria. He married 35 year old Elizabeth (Lillie) Williamson in 1896. They had a son, Caleb. Many of his most famous paintings come from this period. 

He spent World War I in England helping at a hospital. In Australia, he built a house at Kallista, near Melbourne. This was a happy period in Roberts' life.

Elizabeth died in January 1928. Tom remarried, to Jean Boyes, in August 1928. He died in 1931 of cancer in Kallista near Melbourne. He is buried near near Longford, Tasmania.

Roberts painted a lot of fine oil landscapes and portraits. His most famous works, in his time, were two large works, "Shearing the Rams" and "The Big Picture". Roberts had a theme of showing country people working. Many examples of Roberts' work can be seen at the National Gallery of Australia. "The Big Picture" is at Parliament House, Canberra.

Music of Australia

The music of Australia is the music made in the area of, on the subject of, or by the people of modern Australia. This includes its earlier Indigenous and colonial societies. Indigenous Australian music is a part of a 40–60,000 year history which made the didgeridoo. Combinations of Indigenous and Western styles show Australian additions to world music. Some people who do this are Yothu Yindi, Christine Anu and Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu. During its early western history, Australia was made of many British colonies. Australian folk music and bush ballads such as Waltzing Matilda were influenced by Anglo-Celtic culture. Classical forms came from those of Europe. Current Australian music covers many trends. They are often similar to those of the US, the UK, and similar nations. There are oftem similarities in the Australian rock and Australian country music genres.

Notable Australian musicians include: the opera singers Dame Nellie Melba and Dame Joan Sutherland; country music stars Slim Dusty (Australia's biggest selling domestic artist) and John Williamson; solo artists John Farnham and Olivia Newton-John, folk-rocker Paul Kelly; Dance group The Avalanches; jazz guitarist Tommy Emmanuel; pioneer rocker Johnny O'Keefe, global folk-rock band The Seekers, global rock and pop bands Men At Work, The EasyBeats, Bee Gees, Air Supply, Crowded House, AC/DC, INXS, Little River Band, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Midnight Oil, Dragon, Silverchair, Youth Group, You Am I and Powderfinger; the "pop princess" Kylie Minogue, Pendulum, Pop Rock duo Savage Garden and alternative music stars the John Butler Trio and Xavier Rudd.

Australian literature

Australian literature is the written or literary work made in the area or by the people of Australia and its preceding colonies. During its early western history, Australia was many British colonies. Therefore, its literary tradition is linked with English literature. Since 1788, the character of a new continent came into the literature. Themes included Aboriginality, "mateship", egalitarianism, democracy, migrant and national identity, distance from other Western nations and proximity to Asia, the complexities of urban living and the "beauty and the terror" of life in the Australian bush.

Notable Australian writers have included the novelists Marcus Clarke, Miles Franklin, Patrick White, Thomas Keneally, Morris West and Colleen McCullough, the bush poets Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson, historians Manning Clark and Geoffrey Blainey, the playwright David Williamson and leading expatriate writers Barry Humphries, Robert Hughes, Clive James and Germaine Greer.

Colleen McCullough

Colleen Margaretta McCullough (; married name Robinson, previously Ion-Robinson; 1 June 193729 January 2015) was an Australian author. She was famous world-wide.

McCullough was born in 1937. Her parents were James and Laurie McCullough. Her mother was a New Zealander of part-Māori descent. During her childhood, her family moved many times. She read a lot. She attended Holy Cross College.

McCullough earned a living as a teacher, librarian, and journalist. In her first year of medical studies at the University of Sydney she suffered dermatitis. She was told not to be a medical doctor. Instead, she switched to neuroscience and worked in Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney.

In 1963, McCullough moved to the United Kingdom for four years. At Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, she met the chairman of the neurology department at Yale University. He offered her a research associate job at Yale. McCullough spent ten years from April 1967 to 1976 researching and teaching in the Department of Neurology at the Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. It was while at Yale that she wrote her first two books.

Because these books were successful, McCullough stopped being a doctor. In the late 1970s, she lived in London and Connecticut, USA. She finally picked Norfolk Island in the Pacific. There she met her husband, Ric Robinson (then 33 years old). They married on 13 April 1983 (she was 46 years old).

In 1984 a portrait of McCullough, painted by Wesley Walters, was a finalist in the Archibald Prize. The prize is for the "best portrait painting preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in Art, Letters, Science or Politics".

McCullough did a lot of historical research for the novels on ancient Rome. This led to her getting a Doctor of Letters degree by Macquarie University in 1993.

McCullough was a member of the New York Academy of Sciences. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She now lives in Sydney.

Some people did not like McCullough's 2008 novel "The Independence of Miss Mary Bennett". She changed some of the characters in Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice".

Indigenous Australian music

Australian indigenous music includes the music of Australian Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. They are all called Indigenous Australians. It includes a variety of distinctive traditional music styles practiced by Indigenous Australian people. It also has a range of contemporary musical styles of and fusion with European traditions. Music has formed an strong part of the social, cultural and ceremonial observances of these peoples. This is true both in the far past and the present day. There are performance and musical instrumentation which are unique to particular regions or Indigenous Australian groups. There are some musical traditions which are common through much of the Australian continent, and even beyond. The culture of the Torres Strait Islanders is part of New Guinea. 

In addition to these traditions, there has been an influence from the 18th century European colonisation. Likewise non-indigenous artists and performers have used and sampled indigenous Australian styles and instruments in their works. Contemporary musical styles such as rock and roll, country, rap and reggae have all featured a variety of notable Indigenous Australian performers.

A didgeridoo is a type of musical instrument. It is one of the oldest instruments to date. It has a long tube, without finger holes, through which the player blows. It is sometimes fitted with a mouthpiece of beeswax. Didgeridoos are usually made of eucalyptus, but new materials such as PVC piping can be used. 

A clapstick is a type of musical instrument that is in the category of percussion. Unlike drumsticks, which are generally used to strike a drum, clapsticks are for striking one stick on another.

Bunggul is a style of music that came into being around the Mann River. It is known for its intense lyrics. They are often stories of epic journeys. They continue, or repeat, unaccompanied after the music has stopped.

A particular clan in Aboriginal culture may share songs. Songs are about clan or family history. They are often updated to take into account popular movies and music, controversies and social relationships.

Songlines are about Dreamtime. They have oral lore and storytelling in a series of song cycles. These songs often describe how the features of the land were made and named during the Dreamtime. By singing the songs in the right order, indigenous Australians could travel vast distances. 

A mourning lament recorded in a number of places in central and northern Australia and among the Torres Strait Islanders.

The Krill Krill song cycle is new music from east Kimberley. A man named Rover Thomas discovered the ceremony in 1974. This was after a woman to whom he was spiritually related was killed. Thomas says he was visited by her spirit and she gave him the ceremony. In addition to the music, Thomas and others, including Hector Jandany and Queenie McKenzie, made a famous style of painting to go with the ceremony.

Kun-borrk was started around the Adelaide, Mann and Rose Rivers. It has a didgeridoo start and then percussion and vocals. The vocal often include words.

Wangga started near the South Alligator River. It has a very high note to start the song. This joined by rhythmic percussion. It is followed by a sudden shift to a low tone.

A number of Indigenous Australians have had mainstream success, such as Jimmy Little, Yothu Yindi, Troy Cassar-Daley and NoKTuRNL. Indigenous music has also had broad exposure through the world music movement. Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu had international success singing contemporary music in English and in the language of the Yolngu.

Torres Strait Islander musicians include Christine Anu and Seaman Dan.

Skippy the Bush Kangaroo

Skippy the Bush Kangaroo was an Australian television series for children. It was created by John McCallum. It was made from 1966–1968. The show tells the adventures of a young boy and his intelligent pet kangaroo. It happens in the (fictional) Waratah National Park in Duffys Forest, near Sydney, New South Wales.

Ninety-one 30-minute episodes were made over the three seasons of production. At the time of first screening, Australian television was still in black and white. The show was filmed in colour to get more international sales, especially in the United States and Canada. It aired there between 1969 and 1972. The Nine Network repeated the series several times after Australian television became colour in 1975.

The programme was played in Mexico, Cuba, Spain, Czechoslovakia, and Iran.

The GEA is member of the Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research.

The GEA universities have created the "Institut sino-européen d'ingénierie de l'aviation" of Tianjin in partnership with French aerospace companies. This is part of Franco-Chinese cooperation after an Airbus A320 assembly plant was built in Tianjin.

The university, opened in October 2007, trains Chinese students. They follow a course in aerospace engineering, taught in French. After a first year of learning the French language, they follow a master's degree course in aeronautical engineering.

Not linked with the engineering training, three "Mastères Spécialisés" are also taught in Tianjin:

In the Wake of the Bounty

In the Wake of the Bounty is an Australian movie directed by Charles Chauvel. It is the first movie of Errol Flynn. It is based on the 1932 novel "Mutiny on the Bounty" by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. The Australian movie was made two years before MGM's more famous "Mutiny on the Bounty".

The movie mixed re-enactments with documentary. It focused not so much on the mutiny itself as on what happened afterwards.

Kokoda Front Line!

Kokoda Front Line! was a full-length edition of the Australian newsreel. It was produced by the Australian News & Information Bureau and Cinesound Productions Limited in 1942.

Light therapy

Light therapy is a treatment where the patient is exposed to light. Depression, sleeping problems, bipolar disorder and many skin conditions are treated with this therapy. The therapy consists of exposing the patient to a light source (a table lamp, for example). The light source usually emits the full spectrum of light. Sometimes, this has to be done at a specific time of day.

When it is used for skin conditions, it is usually called phototherapy. Example conditions where phototherapy is used are psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. 

Light therapy should generally not be used, in the case the patient also suffers from certain diseases of the eyes. Certain drugs make people more sensitive to light. People taking such drugs should also not use light therapy.

The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory

The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory is a book published in 1984 by psychoanalyst and historian Jeffrey Masson. In the book, Masson criticizes Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) for abandoning the seduction theory, which held that neurotic illness in adults and adolescents was a result of their being sexually abused before puberty. Freud said that his patients confabulated the molestations and then rejected this theory. Masson says that Freud's original view was the correct one.

Falstaff (opera)

Falstaff is an Italian opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi, on a libretto by Arrigo Boito, based on William Shakespeare's "The Merry Wives of Windsor". It was first performed in Milan, on February 9, 1893. Verdi's last opera and perhaps greatest masterpiece, composed when he was 80, and only his second comedy since his earlier attempt "Un giorno di regno" in 1840.

When Verdi composed "Falstaff" he was not writing it for a commission. He was just writing it for his own pleasure, without a performance in mind. When he had finished it he felt that it would be his last work and that his life’s work had finished. It was almost true. It was indeed his last opera and his last big work.

When composers turn plays into operas they usually have to make some changes in the drama to make it suitable to be sung. Verdi had already turned two other Shakespeare plays into opera: "Otello" and "Macbeth". When he composed these he worked with librettists to create something as close to Shakespeare’s plays as possible, but when writing "Falstaff" he took more freedom. The character of Falstaff is very close to the way he is shown in Shakespeare’s "Henry IV" plays, rather than the Falstaff of "The Merry Wives of Windsor".


This takes place in the Garter Inn (). Dr Caius, who is a rich man with servants, complains that Falstaff has beaten his servants and that Falstaff’s two friends Bardolfo and Pistola made him drunk and then stole his money. Falstaff laughs at him. He says he will never get drunk again unless he is in the company of good, religious people. Bardolfo and Pistola in the background sing “Amen” until Falstaff stops them, complaining that they sing out of tune.

Falstaff complains that his bill for the drinks is very high. He says that his two friends drink so much that he won’t have enough to eat and he’ll get thin and then he cannot be his proper self. He says he is in love with two ladies: Mrs Ford and Mrs Page. He has written love letters to them both. He asks his two friends to take the letters to them, but they refuse. Falstaff is cross and gets a page boy to take them instead. Then he chases his friends with a broom.

The next scene changes to the garden of Ford’s house. Four ladies are in the garden: Alice Ford and Meg Page and also Mistress Quickly and Anne Ford, the daughter of Mr and Mrs Ford. Verdi calls her “Nannetta”. The four of them look at the two letters that Alice and Meg have received and find they are exactly the same except for the address. They are amused and a bit annoyed, so they decide to tease Falstaff.

Mr Ford is walking with Dr Caius, Fenton and Falstaff’s two friends. Fenton is a young man who is in love with Nannetta, but Ford does not want him to marry his daughter. Bardolfo and Pistola have deserted Falstaff. They tell Ford that Falstaff is in love with his wife. He is cross, of course, and plans revenge. The music of the four ladies and the music of the five men is sometimes heard separately, and sometimes it is combined. Fenton and Nannetta stay behind to kiss and they sing a love duet. When the men and ladies come back they each sing their own music again. This is a famous ensemble: the way Verdi has combined the two songs is very clever.

Bardolfo and Pistola are back in the Garter Inn with Falstaff. They pretend they are very sorry to have deserted Falstaff. They tell him that there is an old woman outside who wants to speak to him. It is Mistress Quickly, who comes in and curtseys very low to Falstaff. She gives him the message that Alice would love to see him, but that Meg’s husband is guarding her and never leaves her by herself. He can see Alice when her husband is out between two and three o’ clock (). Falstaff is pleased and gives Mistress Quickly a tip (some money) as she leaves. He sings to himself “Alice is mine” (“”).

The next visitor Falstaff has is Ford. Falstaff does not know who he is. Ford says his name is Master Brook (Signor Fontana). He gives Falstaff a purse with silver and tells him that he is in love with Mistress Ford (Alice). He asks Falstaff to get her for him. Falstaff says he will be seeing her that very afternoon. Ford asks him whether he knows Alice’s husband (i.e. himself). Falstaff says he does and he describes to him what a terrible man Ford is. It is a very comic scene with a lot of very clever humour.

When Falstaff goes out to change his clothes Ford shows his anger. When Falstaff returns the two men go out arm in arm like friends, arguing about who shall go through the door first.

Back in Ford’s house the four women are getting ready to tease Falstaff. From the conversation we learn that Ford wants Nannette to marry Dr Caius who is a fussy old man. Nannette of course wants to marry young Fenton.

When Falstaff comes Alice is playing the lute. He sings to her accompaniment. When Quickly says that Ford is coming they hide Falstaff behind a screen. Ford and his men start to search another part of the house, and the women hide Falstaff inside a big laundry basket with dirty clothes. Ford comes back, he hears the sound of kissing and thinks it is his wife with Falstaff, but he finds it is Nannetta and Fenton. Ford goes out furiously, and the women quickly throw the laundry basket out of the window into the river Thames below. When Ford comes back his wife takes him to the window and he sees Falstaff, who is very wet, getting out of the river.

Falstaff is recovering in the Inn. He is very grumpy, although he starts to cheer up when wine is brought. Mistress Quickly comes in and says he can meet Alice, but Falstaff is not really in a mood for this. In the end Quickly manages to persuade him to meet Alice at Herne the Hunter’s Oak in Windsor forest. There is a legend about a black hunter who hanged himself from this tree, and so the spot is haunted by witches and sprites. Falstaff is told he must disguise himself as the black hunter.

The men and women sing an ensemble in which they describe the plot they have made to tease Falstaff. Ford also plots to announce that Caius will marry Nannette.

The last scene takes place at night under Herne’s Oak. The moon shines. Fenton sings an aria. Falstaff appears in his disguise, wearing a pair of antlers on his head and wrapped in a big cloak. Midnight strikes. For a moment he is alone with Alice, but then she leaves him by himself. Nannetta is disguised as the Queen of Fairies. She and her friends sing beautiful music. Falstaff has hidden his face in his cloak, but everyone goes to him and torments him. When people take off their masks Falstaff feels really stupid, although he tries to say that his wittiness helped the joke. Ford announces that Nannetta will marry Caius. Alice leads another couple to him and he announces that they too will marry. When they take off their masks he finds that Bardolfo was disguised as Nannetta, so he will marry Caius! The other couple were Fenton and Nannetta in disguise. Now it is Ford who looks stupid, and Falstaff takes the opportunity to tease him. They finish by singing “” (“Joking is man’s vocation. Wise is he who is jolly”). The music is a fugue, which is usually thought of as being a serious academic form, but the mood here is jolly.

An engravement was made in favour of Falstaff's existence; ("Where 'o where shall the holly be on the night of song, more for thee to ascend in me.")

In the comics, countries flags are drawn as a circle shape. The balls interact in broken English, often referred to as "Engrish", (except for those countries who have English as their main language) and ridicule national stereotypes and international relations.

Polandball has its roots in an August 2009 'cyberwar' between Polish Internet users and the rest of the world on drawball.com. Drawball.com allows Internet users to draw whatever they want. It also allows people to draw over others drawings. On the Polish flag internet, an idea was raised to draw the flag of Poland on the ball. Thousands of Poles managed to take over the drawball. The painting consisted of white on top of red. In the middle, the word "POLSKA" was written. After co-ordination from 4chan, this was then covered over by a giant Nazi swastika.

Krautchan.net is a German-language imageboard. Its /int/ board is frequented by Russian-speaking netizens. The beginning of the Polandball meme is credited to "Falco". Falco is a British user on /int/. In September 2009 Falco created the meme using MS Paint. The meme was made in an apolitical way to troll "Wojak". Wojak is a Pole on the same board and contributes in broken English. Afterwards, Polandball cartoons were enthusiastically drawn by Russians.

A description of Polandball is found on the subreddit /r/Polandballball, which reads "Wiggly mouse-drawn comics where balls represent different countries. They poke fun at national stereotypes and the "international drama" of their diplomatic relations. Polandball combines history, geography, Engrish, and an inferiority complex. The comic series first became popular on a well known German image board /int/."

The premise of Polandball is it represents the history, relations with other countries, and stereotypes. It concentrates on Polish megalomania and national complexes. The meme gained in popularity after the plane crash in Smolensk which killed Polish President Lech Kaczyński. Interactions between countryballs are written in broken English and internet slang. This is similar to the Lolcat meme. Poland is purposely drawn as red on top of white. This is the opposite of the united nations flag. By the end of the cartoon, Poland weeps.

Some Polandball comics are based on the premise that Russia can fly into space. This premise also includes Poland cannot fly into space. One of the most popular Polandball cartoons begins with the premise that Earth is going to be struck by a giant meteor. All countries with space technology leave Earth and go into orbit around the planet. At the end of the cartoon, Poland is still on earth and is crying. In broken English, Poland says their famous catchphrase "Poland cannot into space". In this humorous way, Russians stop discussion with Poles on which country is superior. Another Polandball comic delves into historic-political satire. Poland is seen to be boring other countryballs. Poland proclaims "So when we crushed Russia and the turks [sic] were were the biggest country in the world... and..". This leads other countryballs to laugh at it. Poland, by now irritated, utters "kurwa". Poland holds up a sign saying "Internet serious business". This is an internet slogan used to deride others who treat subjects with disdain. Then, in Polandball convention, Poland finishes by crying.

In 2014, released a game about Polandball for Android. In this game, Poland can into space and the player's goal as long as possible to keep Poland there. There is also the opportunity to play for other countryballs.

Polandball can also include comics on other countries. By convention these comics are usually still referred to as Polandball. They can also be called countryballs. According to Lurkmore.to, Bavaria has its own ball. Other balls have been created for U.S. states, Brazil, Catalonia and Siberia. Singapore and Bermuda are drawn as a triangle and called Tringapore and Bermudatriangle, respectively. Israel takes the form of a hypercube (in reference to Jewish physics). Kazakhstan takes the form of a brick. Britain is shown wearing a top hat and monocle. The United States is shown wearing sunglasses. Nepal, Ohio, and Tampa are shown as animals with teeth almost like a tiger.


Yugoslavs

Yugoslavs is a national name used by a small number of South Slavs across the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Some say this name is for all people of South Slav heritage, including those of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and the presently disputed region of Kosovo, Slovenia, and North Macedonia.

Rhetorical question

A rhetorical question is a figure of speech in the form of a question. It is a question that is asked in order to make a point: it does not need a reply.

The question is used as a rhetorical device or tool. The question is posed for the sake of persuasion, or to encourage the listener or reader to consider a message or viewpoint.

Rhetorical questions suggest a dialogue which does not really exist. The speaker both asks and answers the question himself. A rhetorical question is often a statement in the form of a question.

For example, in "Can't you do "anything" right?", the words are not intended to start an investigation or to invite any response at all. What the words actually mean could change according to circumstance. It could be a little joke between friends, or it could be an insulting criticism. Generally, it would be taken to mean "You can't seem to do anything right".

The role of context is always important if someone asks "What does that mean". Consider this question: "Do you think this treatment is just?". There is no way of knowing whether this is a genuine question or not, because we do not know what the circumstances are. This is true of many kinds of communication, that what they mean varies according to circumstance.

On the other hand, "Is it right for a murderer to be allowed out of prison after only ten years?" clearly asks for the reply "No!". This is because the questioner has "signalled" what answer is expected. A neutral way to describe the situation might be: "A convicted murderer spends at least ten years in jail".

Oskar Kokoschka

Oskar Kokoschka (1 March 1886 – 22 February 1980) was an Austrian artist, poet and playwright. He is best known for his intense expressionistic portraits and landscapes.

Kokoschka's first jobs were postcards and drawings for children. In his early career he did portraits of Viennese celebrities. He was in the Austrian army in World War I and was wounded. At the hospital, the doctors said he was mentally unstable. He traveled across Europe and painted the landscape.
Kokoschka had an affair with Alma Mahler. She stopped the relationship. He continued to love her his entire life. One of his greatest works "The Bride of the Wind" ("The Tempest"), is a tribute to her. His poem "Allos Markar" was about this relationship.

Deemed a degenerate by the Nazis, Kokoschka left Austria in 1934 for Prague. In 1938, when the Czechs were coming for Wehrmacht, he fled to the United Kingdom. He stayed there during the war.

Kokoschka became a British citizen in 1946. In 1978 he got back Austrian citizenship. He traveled to the United States in 1947. Then he moved to Switzerland. He lived there the rest of his life. He died in Montreux.


Kokoschka's literary works are as odd and interesting as his art. His memoir, "A Sea Ringed with Visions", is as wildly psychedelic as anything written by others under the influence of actual hallucinogens. His short play "Murderer, the Hope of Women" is often called the first Expressionist drama. His "Orpheus und Eurydike" (1918) became an opera by Ernst Krenek.




Inge Morath

Ingeborg Morath (May 27, 1923 – January 30, 2002) was an Austrian photographer. In 1953 she joined the Magnum Photos Agency. She became a full photographer with them in 1955. In 1955 she published her first collection of photographs, of a total of 30 monographs during her lifetime.

Ingeborg Morath was born in Graz, Austria. Her parents were scientists. They went to different laboratories and universities in Europe during her childhood. She first went to French-speaking schools. In the 1930s her family moved to Darmstadt, a German intellectual center. Then they moved to Berlin.

Morath's first encounter with "avant-garde" art was the Degenerate Art show by the Nazi party in 1937. It was supposed to make people not like modern art. "I found a number of these paintings exciting and fell in love with Franz Marc's "Blue Horse"", Morath later wrote.

Morath went to Berlin University. At university, Morath studied languages. She learned French, English, and Romanian. Later she added Spanish, Russian and Chinese. Toward the end of World War II, Morath worked for factory service in Tempelhof, alongside Ukrainian prisoners of war. During an attack on the factory by Russian bombers, she ran on foot to Austria. In later years, Morath would not photograph war.

After the Second World War, Morath worked as a translator and journalist. In 1948, she was hired by Warren Trabant. She worked for "Heute". Morath met photographer Ernst Haas in post-war Vienna. She brought his work to Trabant's attention. Working together for "Heute", Morath wrote articles to go along with Haas' pictures. In 1949, Morath and Haas were invited by Robert Capa to join the newly founded Magnum Photos in Paris.

Morath was briefly married to the British journalist Lionel Birch. She moved to London in 1951. That same year, she began to photograph during a visit to Venice. Morath asked for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman. He was then an editor for "Picture Post" and running the picture-agency Report.

Morath divorced Birch and returned to Paris. Her first jobs were stories that did not interest "the big boys." She went to London on an early job to photograph the residents of Soho and Mayfair. Morath's portrait of Mrs. Eveleigh Nash, from that job, is among her best-known works. During the late 1950s Morath traveled widely. She covered stories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the United States, and South America. She worked for such publications as "Holiday", "Paris Match", and "Vogue". In 1955 she published "Guerre à la Tristesse", photographs of Spain, with Robert Delpire. This was followed by "De la Perse à l'Iran", photographs of Iran, in 1958. Morath published more than thirty monographs during her lifetime.

Like many Magnum members, Morath worked as a still photographer on numerous motion picture sets. She met director John Huston while she was living in London. Huston's "Moulin Rouge" (1952) was one of Morath's earliest jobs. It was her first time working in a film studio.

Morath married the playwright Arthur Miller on February 17, 1962. They moved to the United States. Miller and Morath's first child, Rebecca, was born in September 1962. The couple's second child Daniel was born in 1966 with Down syndrome. He was institutionalized shortly after his birth. Today Rebecca Miller is a film director, actress, and writer.

Ingeborg Morath Miller died of cancer in New York City in 2002, at the age of 78.




Jean-Louis Vaudoyer

Jean-Louis Vaudoyer (10 September 1883 20 May 1963) was a French novelist, poet, essayist, and art historian. He was administrator general of the Comédie-Française (1941–1944). He was a member of the Académie française (1950–1963). He wrote the libretto for "Le Spectre de la rose", a ballet choreographed by Michel Fokine for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1911.


Léon Bakst

Léon Samoilovitch Bakst (10 May 1866 – 27 December 1924) was a Russian painter. He designed the sets and costumes for some of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes productions. These were "Cleopatra" (1909), "Scheherazade" (1910), "Carnaval" (1910), "Narcisse" (1911), "Le Spectre de la Rose" (1911), and "Daphnis et Chloé" (1912). Bakst died in 1924 in Paris.

Ballet shoe

Ballet shoes are lightweight shoes designed for and used in ballet dancing. They're usually made from soft leather or satin and have thin and flexible soles. Females are usually given pink colored shoes; males usually get black or white.

Pointe shoes are a special type of ballet shoe. They let dancers stand on their toes.


Cannibalism in animals

In animal science, cannibalism is where an animal eats its own species. Scientists have found more than 1500 species that do this. It is common with insects, spiders and scorpions. There, the male gets eaten by the female, after having sexual intercourse. Many types of frogs will also eat other frogs of the same species. Even, vertebrates like hedgehogs eat their offspring if stressed.

Curtsey

A curtsey (also spelled curtsy or courtesy) is a traditional gesture of greeting, in which a girl or woman lowers her body by bending her knees. It is the female equivalent of male bowing in European cultures. The word "curtsy" comes from "courtesy" which means "politeness".

According to Desmond Morris, the movements in the curtsey and the bow were similar until the 17th century. Only later did the difference between the female and the male gesture develop. The earlier, combined version is still performed by Restoration comedy actors.

When a curtsey is very formal, the girl/woman bends the knees outward (rather than straight ahead), often sweeping one foot behind her. She may also use her hands to hold her skirt out from her body. In Victorian times, when women wore floor-length, hooped skirts, they curtsied using the plié movement borrowed from second-position in classical ballet in which the knees are bent while the back is held straight. Both feet and knees point out so the body lowers straight down. In this way, the lady lowers herself evenly, not to one side. 

Traditionally, women and girls curtsey to people who are of higher rank (more important) than they are, just as men and boys bow. Today this practice has become less common. In European cultures it is traditional for women to curtsey in front of members of the Royal family. This is sometimes called a "court curtsey" and is often very deep. Some female domestic workers curtsey for their employers. 

Female dancers often curtsey at the end of a performance to show thanks or acknowledge applause from the audience. At the end of a ballet class, students will also curtsey or bow to the teacher and the pianist to thank them. According to Victorian dance etiquette, a woman curtseys before beginning a dance. Female Scottish highland dancers performing the national dances and the Irish jig also curtsey as well (at both the beginning and end for the national dances and at the end for the Irish Jig). Some female ballroom dancers will curtsey to their partners before beginning the Viennese Waltz. In some cultures females bow instead of curtseying.

Schönbrunn Palace

Schönbrunn Palace is a former imperial 1,441-room Rococo summer residence in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the most important cultural monuments in the country. Since the 1960s it has been one of the major tourist attractions in Vienna. The palace and gardens show the tastes and interests of Habsburg monarchs.

In the year 1569, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II purchased a large floodplain of the Wien river. It was between Meidling and Hietzing. The emperor had the area to be fenced and put game there such as pheasants, ducks, deer and boar. This was the court's recreational hunting ground. In a small separate part of the area, "exotic" birds such as turkeys and peafowl were kept. Fishponds were built, too.

The name "Schönbrunn" (meaning "beautiful spring") is from an artesian well from which water was consumed by the court.

During the next century, the area was used as a hunting and recreation ground. Eleonora Gonzaga, who loved hunting, spent much time there. She was given the area as her widow's residence after the death of her husband, Ferdinand II. From 1638 to 1643, she added a palace to the Katterburg mansion. In 1642 it was called "Schönbrunn" for the first time. The start of the Schönbrunn orangery seem to go back to Eleonora Gonzaga as well.

The sculpted garden space between the palace and the "Sun Fountain" is called the "Great Parterre". The French garden, a big part of the area, was planned by "Jean Trehet" in 1695. It has a maze.

Western parts were turned into English garden style in 1828–1852. At the outmost western edge, a botanical garden was made in 1828.

Lining the Great Parterre are 32 sculptures, which represent deities and virtues.

After the end of the monarchy in 1918, the new Austrian Republic became the owner of Schönbrunn Palace. They made it a museum.

Later it was used for important events such as the meeting between John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev in 1961.

UNESCO catalogued Schönbrunn Palace on the World Heritage List in 1996, together with its gardens, as a remarkable Baroque ensemble and example of synthesis of the arts.

A part of the song is written on the back of the Azerbaijani 5 manat banknote issued since 2006.

The Azerbaijani law says that there are no official translations for this song.

Azerbaijani people

The Azerbaijanis, (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycanlılar) are a Turkic people living mainly in the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan. A small minority live in southern Dagestan in Russia.

After the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813) and Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), the land of the Iranian Qajar dynasty in the Caucasus were given to the Russian Empire which makes up the present territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Lands which Iran kept are now known as Iranian Azerbaijan. Even though they live on two sides of an international border, the Azerbaijanis are a single ethnic group. However, northerners and southerners differ due to nearly two centuries of separate social evolution of Iranian Azerbaijanis and Russian/Soviet-influenced Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani language unifies Azerbaijanis, and is mutually intelligible with Turkmen, Qashqai, Gagauz, Turkish, and the dialects spoken by the Iraqi Turkmen, all of which belong to the Oghuz, or Western, group of Turkic languages. The Azerbaijanis are mostly Shia Muslim.

Constitutional republic

A constitutional republic is a state where the chief executive and representatives are elected, and the rules are set down in a written constitution. 

The head of state (president) and other representatives are elected but they do not have uncontrolled power. What their power is limited to is written in the constitution. If there is dispute about what the constitution means, this is decided by a court system that is independent from the representatives.

Constitutional republics usually have a separation of powers. The separation of powers means that no single officeholder gets unlimited power. John Adams said that a constitutional republic was ""a government of laws, and not of men"".

This is meant to be a safeguard against tyranny. No office holder can get to a position of absolute power. However, some have argued that a constitution can be written in such a way that it lets tyranny arise, and that a constitution is therefore not a fail proof safeguard against tyranny.

Aristotle was the first to write about the idea in his works on politics.

Constitutional monarchies are a special case: even though the monarch is not elected, the people still elect other governing bodies. The constitution also limits the power of the monarch.

Comparisons can be made. There are countries which nominally are constitutional republics, but which have become (in effect) dictatorships. There are also countries which have no written constitution, and are monarchies, but which act in a similar way to constitutional republics.

Amur leopard

The Amur leopard ("Panthera pardus orientalis") is a leopard subspecies. It is sometimes called the far eastern leopard.

The leopard lives in the Primorye region of southeastern Russia and in the Jilin Province of northeast China. It is critically endangered (IUCN). Only 14–20 adults and 5–6 cubs were counted in 2007. Only 19–26 Amur leopards live in the wild.

The Amur leopard's range has decreased considerably in the previous century. This species is still at high risk of extinction, and conservation efforts are ongoing. The Amur leopards are endangered because they have been hunted for their fur. Also because their food sources are running out due to them being hunted for their fur. Amur leopards can be recognized from the patterns in their fur. They weigh about . They live in temperate, broadleaf and mixed forests. The Amur Leopard almost extinct by human hunting. It's called human hunting since the humans tear down the forest so no tree and bushes so the leopard cannot hide. At that time, they hunt them and sell to get money.

The number of Amur cats is decreasing due to the human activity, invasion of domestic cats, and infectious disease. Because these cats play a huge role and the ecosystem cannot afford to lose such species, researchers found a way to regenerate the endangered animal. This can be done from culture cell with somatic cloning technique. 

They breed in spring and early summer. Most of them are in captive breeding programs. They give birth to one to four cubs. Inbreeding is common in the wild. Their diet consists of roe deer, sika deer, badgers and hares.

Among the Amur leopards, are Amur tigers, who are sympatric to Amur leopards. However, their activity patterns reveal low spatial overlap which allows these similar predators to coexist.

The start of the dynasty is connected with Shamsaddin Eldaniz of Kipchak origin. Thus, Eldaniz, who took Arran as an iqta by Sultan Masud, soon spread his power throughout Azerbaijan.  After his son Arslanshah also ruled in 1160, Eldaniz seized power in the Seljuk sultanate of Iraq. During the reign of Shamsaddin Eldaniz, the lands covered Arran, Azerbaijan, Shirvan, Cibal, Hamadan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan, Rey, Mosul, Kirman, Persia, Khuzistan, Akhlat, Erzurum and Maragha.ere a Turkic dynasty of Kipchak origin. They controlled most of northwestern Persia, eastern Transcaucasia, including Arran, most of Azerbaijan, and Djibal. At their biggest, the land they had was about most of north-western and upper-central modern Iran, most of the regions of modern Azerbaijan and smaller portions in modern Armenia, Turkey and Iraq. 

The strengthening of the dynasty is connected with the period of Mohammad Jahan Pahlava.  After the death of Sultan Arslanshah in 1175, Jahan Pahlavan, who brought his 7-year-old son Togrul III to power, declared himself his ancestor and, like Shamsaddin Eldaniz, took de facto power. Atabey Jahan Pahlavan suppressed revolts against the central government and established friendly relations with the ruling dynasties in the neighborhood.  Since the period of Jahan Pahlava was a period of stability, cultural spheres developed in the lands under the rule of the Eldenizs.  During the reign of the mentioned Atabey, the capital of the Eldenizs was moved from Nakhchivan to Hamadan. 
Atabeg means ""father lord"" in Turkic languages. It was the title given to the Turkic officers of Seljuq dynasty. Atabegs were not only vice-regents, but also de-facto rulers.

Constitution of Azerbaijan

The Constitution of Azerbaijan was started on 12 November 1995 by a popular referendum. It was changed three times by a popular referendums, on 24 August 2002, on 18 March 2009 and on 26 September 2016. The constitution is the "highest legal force" in Azerbaijan.

The Preamble to the Constitution says, in order to "provide prosperity and welfare of the whole society and each individual", that the following objectives be declared:



Azerbaijani manat

The Manat is the national money used in Azerbaijan. It is divided into 100 "qəpik". The word "manat" comes from the Russian word "moneta" which means coin. Manat was also the name of the Soviet ruble in both the Azerbaijani and Turkmen languages.

The Azerbaijani manat symbol, , is not easily typed on computers, so "m" or "man." can be used instead.
Azerbaijani manat is also written as AZN. In Azerbaijan people can only use manats. Azebaijani manats are more valuable than the United States dollar and almost as valuable as the Euro.



Azerbaijan Time

Azerbaijan Time, or AZT, is a time zone used in Azerbaijan. The standard time zone is four hours ahead of UTC (UTC+4). 
The daylight saving time, Azerbaijan Summer Time (AZST), which was one hour ahead of the standard AZT at UTC+5 was abolished in March 2016.

Left- and right-hand traffic

The driving side of a road is the side where vehicles must drive. Each country says whether vehicles will drive on the right-hand or left-hand side of the road. This is sometimes called the rule of the road. This basic rule makes traffic move more easily. It also lowers the risk of head-on collisions. Today about 66.1% of the world's people live in countries that drive on the right-hand side; 33.9% live in countries that drive on the left-hand side.

The side driven on is usually the other side from which a vehicle's steering wheel and instrument panel are located. That is, right-hand drive vehicles are normal when driving on the left-hand side of the road, and left-hand drive vehicles are used when driving on the right-hand side of the road.

Most countries that drive on the left-hand side are former British colonies. Some other countries chose the left-hand side of the road. These countries include: Japan, Thailand, Nepal, Bhutan, Mozambique, Suriname, East Timor, and Indonesia. Today, only four European countries drive on the left-hand, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, and Cyprus, all of which are islands. There are several countries where their territories that exist outside the mainland drive on a different side from the mainland. One well-known example is that all of China drives on the right-hand except for its Special Administrative Regions Hong Kong and Macau, which drive on the left-hand.

Before the creation of the automobile, people mostly rode on the left-hand side, since most people were right-handed and would whip their horses with their left hands. Warriors in battle could also use their right hand to hold and control their weapon. During the 1700s, many farmers began to pull their vehicles using teams of horses rather than just one. In 1794, France passed the first right-hand driving laws, and this law would spread with Napoleon's conquests. The territories and regions of the former Austro-Hungarian and Portuguese Empires refused to change the direction of driving at first, but most eventually chose to drive on the right-side. Only Mozambique, East Timor, and Macau (all former Portuguese colonies) still drive on the left-side. Canada, Myanmar, Gibraltar, British Indian Ocean Territory, Belize, and a few countries in West Africa like Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and The Gambia all switched to driving on the right hand side of the road.

Telephone numbers in Azerbaijan

Telephone numbers in Azerbaijan follow the recommended format for its telephone numbering plan.

A caller from outside Azerbaijan would dial the international access number, usually 00. They then dial the country code which is 994 for Azerbaijan. Then they dial the two-digit area code, and then the seven-digit local number. 

For a local call one simply dials the local number.

On 1 August 2011, Azerbaijan reorganized its national numbering plan for area codes. Only the area codes of Baku, Sumqayit, and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (area codes 12, 18 and 36) stayed the same as before. The following tables list both the old and new area codes.

United Nations Human Rights Council

The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is in the United Nations System. The UNHRC took the place of the former United Nations Commission on Human Rights (CHR). It was established by the United Nations General Assembly. 

The General Assembly made the UNHRC on 15 March 2006. This was to replace the previous CHR. People did not like the CHR because they allowed countries with poor human rights records to be members.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon and former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson have not liked that the council acts for politics instead of human rights. Several people have said the council focuses too much on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The United States did not take part in the Council when George W. Bush was president. They changed when Barack Obama became President.

On 18 June 2007, the UNHRC made a plan for future work. They will assess the human rights in all 192 UN Member States. They will also allow people and organizations to bring complaints about human rights violations to the attention of the Council.

There is a lot of pressure from the neighboring Muslim empires.

The Georgian language is the official language of the country.

Atropates

Atropates (c. 370 BC – after 321 BC) was a Persian nobleman who served Darius III and then Alexander III of Macedon. He made an independent kingdom. A dynasty was named after him. Diodorus Siculus calls him 'Atrapes'. Quintus Curtius wrongly names him 'Arsaces'.

At the end of the Achaemenid Empire, Atropates was governor ("satrap") of the Achaemenid province of Media. In the Battle of Gaugamela (October 331 BCE) between Darius and Alexander, Atropates was in charge of the Achaemenid troops of Media.

When Darius lost he went to the Median capital of Ecbatana. Atropates helped him. Darius tried to get a new army but could not. He left Ecbatana in June 330 BCE. After Darius' death a month later at the hands of Bessus, Atropates surrendered to Alexander. Alexander first chose Oxydates as satrap of Media. In 328-327 BCE Alexander did not trust in Oxydates' loyalty. Atropates was made satrap again. In 325-324, Atropates gave Baryaxes (a rebel of the area) to Alexander. Alexander thought highly of Atropates.

Alexander died on June 10, 323 BCE. Atropates' new son-in-law Perdiccas was named regent of Alexander's half-brother Philip III. After the "Partition of Babylon" in 323 BCE, Media was divided into two parts. The greater portion in the south-east was governed by Peithon, a general of Perdiccas. The smaller portion in the north west was given to Atropates. At some point, Atropates made his part of Media an independent kingdom. His son-in-law Perdiccas was murdered by Peithon in the summer of 320 BCE.

The dynasty Atropates made would rule the kingdom for several centuries. They became vassals of the Seleucids, then as vassals of the Arsacids.

The area of Atropates' kingdom was known to the Greeks as "Media Atropatene" after Atropates. Then as simply "Atropatene". The Arsacids called it 'Aturpatakan' in Parthian, as did also the Sassanids. Eventually Middle Iranian 'Aturpatakan' became 'Azerbaijan'. This is where the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Iranian province of Azerbaijan get their name.

The short film opened the International Brasília Festival, the 27th São Paulo International Film Festival, the Paulista Audio Visual Festival, as well as the Palm Springs International Festival of Short Films. The short tells the tale of a boy whose girlfriend's sexual fantasy is to have sex in a bathtub filled with strawberry jam. Frightened, the boy is advised by his psychiatrist to play along with the girl's fantasies, but at their first family dinner together, he discovers that the shrink is her father.

In 2003, Fernando Andrade went on a journey with Caetano Veloso to São Paulo, New York and Japan.

According to Eric J Lyman, Hollywood Reporter, it was "one of the highlights of the weekend." The screening took place at the Conciliacione auditorium, Blasco Giurato (Director of Photography of Cinema Paradiso) was there. The film has one of the last registries of the filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni, before he died in 2007.

The critic from "O Globo" newspaper, Marcelo Janot, considered it "The best film from the recent batch of documentaries of Brazilian musicians."

In 2010, Fernando directed the documentary short "Newspaper of the Future". The film documents changes within the newspaper "Folha de São Paulo" during the integration with its on-line counterpart, Folha.com. It also showcased the new graphic design template being implemented and presented to the newspapers employees. Filmed during 15 days at the newspapers headquarters and printing press in Tamboré, the production interviewed personalities such as Otavio Frias Filho, managing editor of Folha and the columnists: Clóvis Rossi, Juca Kfouri, José Simão and Barbara Gancia, amongst others.

In 2011, he released the documentary "Breaking the Taboo", which discusses alternative policies for the failed war on drugs and has the Ex-President of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, as its anchor. The film features statements from Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Paulo Coelho, Dráuzio Varella, Gael Garcia Bernal and 4 other former heads of state from countries such as Colombia, Switzerland, Norway and Mexico. The film promoted debate in the media, schools and even in the Brazilian congress, with a speech by senator Eduardo Suplicy. Veja Magazine published a 9-page article on the film calling it "a meticulously crafted report made over two years with 168 interviews from personalities, some of them of the same caliber as mentioned above, and others less known, but no less credible." The television show Fantástico of Rede Globo aired an 8-minute report on the film and later polled the viewers on the subject, 57% voted in favor of legalization. Trip magazine published a cover story on the film. Filmed in 18 cities around the world, the interviewed subjects include premiers, policemen, inmates and rehabilitated addicts who help compose a board that debates and consolidates the films argument.

The Newspaper Folha de São Paulo considered that the film had "A consistent argumentative route, not necessarily aligned with common sense". The film also had repercussions in the English newspaper The Guardian: "The documentary highlights the perils of debating an issue so clouded by ideology and calls for an end to the stigmatization of the debate. It boasts the support of several former world leaders including Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter." The documentary is currently being adapted for the American and European market in partnership with the production house Current Sponge, led by Sam Branson, son of the entrepreneur Richard Branson.

Karabakh horse

The Karabakh horse , also known as Karabakh, is a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse. It is named after the geographic area where the horse was first developed, Karabakh in the Southern Caucasus. It is an area that is part of Azerbaijan. The highland part is currently under control by Armenia. The breed is noted for its good temper and speed. For example, in 2004 a Karabakh horse named Kishmish from the Agdam stud in Azerbaijan set a speed record by running 1000 metres in 1 minute 9 seconds, and 1600 metres in 1 minute, 52 seconds.

The breed is thought to be a cross-breeding of Akhal-Teke, Persian, Kabarda, Turkoman, and Arabian horse. Right now, the Karabakh is bred mainly in Azerbaijan's Shaki area. Currently the breed numbers are below 1,000. It is threatened with extinction.

The breed is hardy, strong, tough, and sure-footed.

The horse is not large. It is 14-15 hands high or 145–150 cm. They have small, clean-cut heads, a straight profile with broad foreheads, and nostrils that can dilate. The neck is set high, average in length, muscular and elegant. They have compact bodies with well defined and developed muscles. The shoulders are often quite upright. The horses have a deep chest, a sloping croup, and long, fine, but very strong legs, although the joints are small. The horses are narrow, not very deep through the girth, due to the Akhal-Teke influence.

Their skin is thin and soft with shiny hair. The main colors of the breed are chestnut and bay, with characteristic golden tint of the breed. They can also be gray. Rarely they can be Palomino or Buckskin. White markings are allowed.

They are fast and agile. The Karabakh horse is said to have a good endurance and loyalty to master.

Chokha

It has been in wide use among Caucasians from the 9th century until 1920s. Nowadays, chokha is no longer in use but continues to still be worn for ceremonial and festive occasions.

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili made high-ranking Georgian officials working abroad to wear the national costume at official meetings. So, in the very center of Europe, in the 21st century, among the elegant ladies and gentlemen classic suits, you will find men in their Chokhas, and daggers around the waist.

There are Four types of Chokha worn among the Georgians:

In Georgia, the Black chokha was reserved to the "Order of Chokhosani". They represent the elite society of the citizens. These were people with special dedications such as: Great generals, heroes or some of the famous poets and the people who had done some big service to the country. Not even all of Lords were allowed in "Chokhosani Orden" and those who did proudly represented this rank in their clothing.

Chokha is sewn of thick fabric and is tight on the waist and wide on the bottom. In some parts of the Caucasus there are also female chokhas.

Generally, the chokha outfit includes a khanjali (the sword), the akhalukhi also know as the arkhalig (a shirt worn underneath the chokha), the gazyrs (the bullets), and the bashlyk (a hood, separate from the robe) or papakha (a tall fur hat).

Eastern world

The term Eastern world means very broadly the various cultures or social structures and philosophical systems of Eastern Asia or geographically the Eastern Culture. This includes the Indian subcontinent (which is Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Nepal and sometimes Afghanistan), the Far East (which is China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Philippines,
Malaysia, Mongolia, Indonesia, Japan, North Korea, South Korea), Australasia (Australia, New Zealand), Eastern Europe/Eurasia (Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkey). The Middle East/Near East and Central Asia are, as their names imply, often considered 'east' in terms of Europe

The division between "East" and "West" is from European cultural history. There is a difference between European Christendom and the alien cultures beyond it to the East. With the European colonization of the Americas the East/West distinction became global. The idea of an Eastern, "Indian" (Indies) or "Oriental" sphere was made stronger by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences. Such differences were shown by Westerners in the scholarly tradition known as Orientalism and Indology. People from the East are known by certain regions in the West as "Oriental". During the Cold War, the term "Eastern world" was sometimes used to mean the Eastern Bloc, which was the Soviet Union, China and their communist allies. The term "Western world" often meant the United States and its NATO allies such as the United Kingdom. The idea is often another term for the Far East—a region that bears considerable cultural and religious sameness. Eastern philosophy, art, literature, and other traditions, are often found throughout the region in places of high importance, such as popular culture, architecture and traditional literature. The spread of Buddhism and Hindu Yoga is partly responsible for this.

Eastern culture has created many themes and traditions. Some important ones are:

Ghazal

The ghazal is a poetic form that has rhyming couplets and a refrain, with each line sharing the same meter. A ghazal talks about both the pain of loss and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. The form is ancient. It started in 6th century Arabic verse. It comes from the Arabian panegyric qasida. The structure of the ghazal are similar in strictness to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In its style and content it is a genre with a lot of variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation. It is one of the main poetic forms the Indo-Perso-Arabic civilization gave to the eastern Islamic world. 

The ghazal spread into South Asia in the 12th century. This was because of the influence of Sufi mystics and the courts of the new Islamic Sultanate. Although the ghazal is mostly a form of Dari poetry and Urdu poetry, today it is found in the poetry of many languages of the Indian sub-continent. 

Ghazals were written by the Persian mystics and poets Rumi (13th century) and Hafiz (14th century), the Azeri poet Fuzuli (16th century), as well as Mirza Ghalib (1797–1869) and Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938). Through Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832), the ghazal became very popular in Germany during the 19th century. The form was used by Friedrich Rückert (1788–1866) and August von Platen (1796–1835). The Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali liked the form. He edited a volume of "real ghazals in English". 

It is common in ghazals for the poet's name to be in the last verse. This is known as takhallus.

Some of those are Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and to a smaller amount Kyrgyzstan.

The stories were first told orally before they were written as a book. There are many versions of the stories. Many dates have been used for the first written copies. Geoffery Lewis dates it fairly early in the 15th century. Cemal Kafadar said that it was no earlier than the 15th century. Stanford Jay Shaw (1977) in his history of the Ottoman empire dates it in the 14th century.

User guide

A user guide, also called a user manual or (less frequently) instruction manual, is a book about how to use something.

A computer usually has a user guide to tell people how to use it. A computer program also often has a user guide.

People who want to write a user guide must keep the words very simple so other people can understand what you are saying. It also helps to put many pictures into the user guide. 

If there are pictures, people who read or speak a different language can still understand what to do with the equipment or software.

Cyril Bourlon de Rouvre

Cyril Hubert Marie Bourlon de Rouvre is a French businessman and politician born the 19th of December 1945 at Boulogne-Billancourt.

RNA polymerase

RNA polymerase (RNAP) is the enzyme which does transcription.The 2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Roger D. Kornberg for creating detailed molecular images of RNA polymerase during various stages of the transcription process.

With the help of some other molecules, it makes messenger RNA from a strand of a DNA. This is its main function, but it does various other things. Products of RNAP include:

Eukaryotes have various RNAPs in their nuclei, each to synthesis a type of RNA. All are similar and related to each other and to bacterial RNAP:

Eukaryotic chloroplasts have an RNAP very similar to bacterial RNAP ("plastid-encoded polymerase"). Eukaryotic chloroplasts also have a second, unrelated, RNAP.

Eukaryotic mitochondria contain an unrelated RNAP (member of the "single-subunit RNAP" protein family).

X-ray crystallography of DNA and RNA polymerases show that, other than having a Mg ion at the catalytic site, they are virtually unrelated to each other. So the two classes of enzyme have arisen independently twice in the early evolution of cells. One line led to the modern DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases. The other line led to all modern cellular RNA polymerases.

Ashik

An Ashik is a traveling bard, in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, and Iran. They sing and play the saz, a form of lute. The songs are made up on the spot around common ideas.

The Ashik tradition started with the Shamanistic beliefs of ancient Turkic peoples. The ancient ashiks were called by many names. Some names were "bakhshi" (Baxşı), dede (dədə), and uzan or ozan. They helped keep oral tradition, helped make a shared value system and kept the culture of their people. 

In September 2009, Azerbaijan’s ashik art was added to the UNESCO Cultural Heritage Lists. The word Ashik comes from the Arabic word "Asheq". It means the "one who is in love".

Akinchi

Akinchi, also written as Ekinchi ( / اکينچي) was an Azerbaijan newspaper. It was made in Baku It was the first newspaper fully printed in the Azerbaijani language. It was also the first newspaper in Russia printed in a Turkic language. The name means "The Ploughman".

Hasan bey Zardabi started the newspaper. He was a journalist, teacher and scientist. "Akinchi" was thought to be almost revolutionary because of the language it was made in and that so many people could read it. Zardabi used a simpler form of the Azeri language so more people could read the paper.

The Russian governor of the Caucasus Dmitry Staroselsky liked Zardabi's plans. Staroselsky supported him in starting "Akinchi". He was also the one to name the newspaper. He thought the name would make the authorities think that "Akinchi" was non-political and about agriculture. In addition to agriculture articles Zardabi wrote about medicine and biology. There were also stories about the social and cultural state of Muslims in the Caucasus. The first issue of "Akinchi" was printed on 22 July 1875.

Partly because Staroselsky left, the paper ended on 29 September 1877. There was also little money and few readers. There were only 300 constant readers. The paper helped there be more journalism in Azerbaijan.

Spitting spider

A spitting spider is a spider in the family Scytodidae. There are more than 150 species of spitting spider in the world. Spitting spiders are related to the recluse spiders in the "Sicariidae" family.

The name "spitting spider" comes from the way these spiders hunt. The spider spits a sticky and poisonous liquid at its prey. The liquid congeals (becomes solid) around the target. When the prey is trapped, the spider bites it to kill it with venom. It then wraps the prey in spider silk like many other spiders do.

A spitting spider attack is very fast. It takes about 1/700th of a second. This kind of spider can spit . The spider spits in a Z pattern and criss-crosses its prey in sticky liquid.

There are five genera of spitting spiders:

Absheron District

Absheron Rayon, also spelled as Apsheron, is a raion of Azerbaijan. There is also an Absheron Peninsula, but they are not in the same area.

Absheron was started in 1963 by the Soviet government. There are lots of historical monuments in Absheron. For example, in the village Aşağı Güzdək there are agricultural tools from the 19th century. In Goradile village, there is Abdurrahman mosque from the 19th century. Mosques from the 18th century are in Məmmədli. Ancient wells which provided water supply to people living in this territory are still used in Aşağı Güzdək and Xirdalan. Tombs from 8th - 18th centuries are also kept: in Fatmai, Digah, Masazir, Hökməli and Saray.

The name Absheron comes from the words 'ap shuran'. This means 'place of salty water' in an ancient Iranian Azeri language.

Rayon

Rayon is a manufactured reconstituted cellulose fiber. It is made from purified cellulose. This is mainly from wood pulp, which is chemically changed into a soluble compound. It is then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments. These are chemically solidified, resulting in man-made fibres of nearly pure cellulose. Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring polymers, it is considered a semi-synthetic fiber.

Macedonian phalanx

The Macedonian phalanx is an infantry formation developed by Philip II. It was used by his son Alexander the Great to conquer the Persian Empire. The formation was made up of spearmen carrying 18 to 20 ft (5.56 m) long pikes. These were called sarissas. They were two-handed; the smaller shields were slung over the left shoulder. 

The Macedonian phalanx was impregnable from the front, but vulnerable from the sides and back, where it could be attacked by the enemy cavalry. Therefore, the system required protection, which it got from the Macedonian cavalry, which was the most flexible force. At the start of a battle, Alexander used the phalanx to pin down the enemy. His heavy cavalry would drive the enemy horse from the field, and then charge selected opponents or exposed enemy unit flanks. Then, the phalanx would move against the centre. 

The early Greek city states often fought on narrow valley floors, where cavalry was not so important. Often, there was little or no cavalry. But in the Greco-Persian Wars, the battles were fought on more open land, where cavalry was a great force. An example of this is the Battle of Gaugamela. There, Alexander manoeuvered to the right to prevent a double envelopment from the Persian army. Darius commanded his cavalry on his left flank to check the oblique movement of the Greeks by attacking their cavalry. Alexander's Companion cavalry then charged the weakened enemy center where Darius was posted and were followed by the phalanx formation.

Confectionery

Confectionery or sweets is a type of food that has a lot of sugar in it and is very sweet. It often includes things that are rich in artificial sweeteners, flavours and colourings. The words candy (North America), sweets (UK and Ireland) and lollies (Australia and New Zealand) are also used for the many kinds of confections. Confections are usually low in nutrients but rich in calories. Sweets can come from anywhere.

Sustainable seafood

For thousands of years, people have caught and eaten fish and seafood. Today this has become a problem: The population has increased, and more fish and seafood need to be caught to feed all the people. This means that the populations of fish have less time to regenerate, and they get depleted, which is known as overfishing. Sustainable seafood is the idea of catching the fish, without putting the ecosystem they come from in danger. Sustainable seafood is either caught wild, or it is farmed, but without endangering the ecosystem, and giving the stocks a chance to grow. There are different non-profit organizations that watch over these rules. Special "labels" have been created so the consumer can see that the fish or seafood was bred or caught in accordance with these rules.

Howlin' Wolf

Chester Arthur Burnett (10 June 1910 – 10 January 1976), known as Howlin' Wolf, was an American blues singer. He was born on a plantation near Ruleville, Mississippi. Burnett tried to emulate the singing style of Jimmie Rodgers, a white, country yodeler. Although he never mastered the yodeling technique, his distinctive style earned him the nickname of "The Wolf".

Burnett traveled around the Mississippi delta for nearly twenty years singing with famous blues artists, including Robert Johnson and Sonny Boy Williamson. In 1949, the Wolf moved to Chicago and spent time with Muddy Waters. They recorded for Chess Records. While Waters toured the country performing, Burnett began to play at several of the Chicago clubs frequented by Waters. After Burnett was embraced by the Chicago R&B scene, a rivalry developed between him and Waters.

The Wolf had a series of hits in the 1950s, including "Moanin' at Midnight", "Killing Floo", "How Many More Years", "I Ain't Smart", and "Smokestack Lightin'".

Oligochaete

Oligochaetes are a subclass of worms in the phylum Annelida.

With around 10,000 species the Oligochaetes make up about a half of the phylum Annelida. These worms usually have few chaetae or "bristles" on the outer body surface, unlike polychaetes. The best known is the garden earthworm.

Oligochaetes are segmented worms and most have a spacious body cavity (coelom) which is used as a hydroskeleton. They range in length from less than 0.5 millimetres (0.020 in) up to 2 to 3 metres (6.6 to 9.8 ft) in the 'giant' species such as the Giant Gippsland Earthworm and the Mekong Worm "Amynthas mekongianus".

Worm

A worm is a bilateral animal. It usually has no arms or legs, and a slender cylinder-like body. 

Worms come in many different sizes. Some species are very small, while the bootlace worm has been known to grow up to nearly 60 meters (almost 200 feet). One of the best-known types of worms are earthworms.

Worm is not a term used by itself in animal classification. There are worms which belong to several phyla. Examples of words include: Annelids, nematodes, platyhelminthes, ribbon worms, arrow worms, priapulid worms, and some insect larvae. They are all animals which may be called 'worms'.


Many unrelated insect larvae are called "worms", such as the railroad worm, woodworm, glowworm, bloodworm, inchworm, mealworm, silkworm, and woolly bear worm.

Worms may also be called helminths, particularly in medical terminology when referring to parasitic worms, especially the Nematoda (roundworms) and Cestoda (tapeworms). "Helminthology" is the study of parasitic worms. When a human or an animal, such as a dog or horse, is said to "have worms", it means that it is infested with parasitic worms, typically roundworms or tapeworms. Deworming kills off the worms that have infected a human or animal by giving anthelmintic drugs.

"Ringworm" is not a worm at all, but a skin fungus.

Worms include several groups. The three main phyla are:

Ikariam

Ikariam is a browser-based massively multiplayer online (MMO) game. It is from the company Gameforge AG. "Ikariam" is a strategy, text/picture based game. "Ikariam" was released in 2008. It is currently, as of May 2, 2012, on version 0.5.0. The game is set during the era of Ancient Greece.

The aim of the game is to expand the town which is controlled by a player, to gather resources and conquer other players. The game can be played for short periods of time. The player can build and research and it is during real time so the player can return at a later point and assign the town's people a new tasks. Upon registering, players are given control of a small town. The town's people pay taxes to the player or can be sent to gather resources instead. The game world is split into islands, each of which can support up to 16 (or up to 17 if the player purchases ambrosia) players and their towns. Each island has a structure called a Saw Mill. There are four types of islands, one is a crystal, one is sulfur, one is wine, and one is marble. With those four resources the player may construct buildings such as barracks, shipyards and academies. Citizens of the town can then be trained as soldiers, sent to research new technologies, or perform other tasks, which they are paid tax money for undertaking. Citizens must be kept happy to prevent them from leaving the town. Citizens happiness factors change multiple ways, the construction of a tavern is one of the best ways to gain happiness. Another way to gain is by building museums and set up cultural treaties with other players.

The game also provides four advisors to guide the player throughout the game; they are shown in the top right of the screen. From left to right the names are: Towns, Military, Research and Diplomacy.


Ikariam is free-to-play but players may opt to purchase in-game advantages via a Microtransaction system. This will give them access to a sixth resource called Ambrosia, which can be used for Ikariam Plus, the premium version of Ikariam.

On building an embassy and upgrading it to level three a player is then able to create an alliance. An alliance is a group of players with the same interests or goals. The players can also put their own units into each others towns for extra defense. With an alliance you can do join raids and work together on taking over towns. If you are the leader of the alliance, how many members you can have in your alliance depends on your embassy level. Also, you get a small amount of "bonus" resources each day, depending on the number of people in your alliance. An alliance has three jobs that can be assigned by the leader: the Diplomat, the General and the Home Secretary. The diplomat is responsible for making treaties, answering messages sent to the alliance, and editing the external alliance page which is viewable by all players. The General is responsible for overlooking all alliance members military movements, and has the ability to call off any attacks being made by alliance members. The Home Secretary is responsible for editing ranks within the alliance and editing the internal alliance page which is viewed only by the alliance members.

There are many worlds in "Ikariam". The current worlds go from Alpha to Ypsilon.

Later, Phantom Unit goes to Pakistan. They have to capture Edward Page, a former US Ranger who has joined the K.P.R. Alliance. After his capture, Page says that General Tong is planning to bomb America from North Korea. The squad can kill Tong, but after a while Popovich captures Downs and Walker. A nuclear missile is then launched to destroy Seattle. As prisoners of K.P.R., they can escape after a while, destroy the nuclear weapons. After that, the US miliary can end the KPR threat by retaking American ground.

Reactivity series

In introductory chemistry, the reactivity series or activity series is an empirical series of metals, in order of chemical reactivity from highest to lowest. It is used to summarize information about the chemical reactions of metals with acids and water, single displacement reactions and the extraction of metals from their ores. The elements at a higher level are more reactive, whereas the elements at a lower level are less reactive.

The reactivity series reads as follows, starting at the most reactive, going down to the least reactive:

Special forces

Special forces, or special operations forces are military units used to trained to perform unconventional (not ordinary), difficult, often high-risk missions. They are highly-trained and are the most valuable units in the world. Because of the hard training and the high risk, there are not many special forces units. Those elite units are often used to operate deep behind enemy lines. In a war they are also used for unconventional warfare.

Because special forces are really rare, they mostly have to do unusual, difficult things like:

Special forces were very important in the history of warfare where war is more defined as "hit and run" and sabotage, and not traditional army combat where quantity was more important than quality.

The Chinese strategist "Jiang Ziya" said about 1,000 B.C. ago that such elite units had many advantages, recruiting talented and motivated men to be serving in specialised units should be more important than other things.

Special forces were formed in the early 20th century, during World War I. In this "big" war, military operations inside enemy territory showed tactical benefits. They were often used to sabotage enemy infrastructure like radio stations, which are important for communication between the troops.

Special forces units gained more importance during World War II, when technology became more important. The Special Forces of the United States Army, formed at that time, specialize in helping local guerilla forces and training them.

Jecheon AIDS scandal

Jecheon AIDS scandal or Jecheon AIDS crime was a well-known sex crime that happened in Jecheon, South Korea. A male taxi driver was arrested by the police on 13 March 2009 for knowingly spreading HIV/AIDS to dozens of women in Jecheon between 2003 and 2009.

The offender was Mr. Jeon, a 27-year-old taxi driver who has HIV. He had sex with many women over five to six years, despite knowing his condition. The police said that his partners included drunken taxi passengers as well as bar girls he came to know while working as a driver. Many of the women were married women, housewives, or divorcees. Jeon rarely used condoms, according to local media.

Jeon said that he had had sex with ten women, but a survey estimated the number at between 70 and 400. His mobile phone, which had been confiscated by police, contained the phone numbers of about seventy women.


Raven paradox

The Raven paradox is a paradox first presented by the German logician Carl Gustav Hempel in the 1940s. The paradox stems from two intuitive principles for inductive reasoning: (i) logically-equivalent claims are interchangeable and (ii) particular instances confirm the corresponding universal generalization. Hempel showed that (i) and (ii) together entail the unintuitive conclusion that claims of the form "All As are Bs" can be confirmed by observing non-A, non-B objects.

Saying:

is logically equivalent to saying:

Whenever (2) is true, (1) is too; likewise in all circumstances where (2) is false (i.e. if a world with white ravens is imagined), (1) is also false. Accordingly, (1) and (2) can be safely interchanged with one another.

Next, a particular object which is both A and B intuitively constitutes evidence for the claim "All As are Bs". Thus,

is evidence supporting the hypothesis that 

Following the same reasoning, a green apple (a non-black and non-raven object) is evidence supporting the hypothesis that all non-black things are non-ravens. 

The paradox appears when these two principles are combined. If a green apple is evidence for "all non-black things are non-ravens" and "all non-black things are non-ravens" is equivalent to "all ravens are black", then green apples are also evidence for the hypothesis that "all ravens are black"! This conclusion is highly unintuitive despite the appeal of both starting principles. 

Margin of error

The margin of error is a way to measure the sampling error in the results of a statistical survey. A bigger margin of error means that the results are less certain. Margins of error occur when a population is incompletely sampled. Usually, the margin of error is defined as the radius (half the width) of a confidence interval for a given sample.

Overfishing

Overfishing is catching too much fish. It is a type of overexploitation where fish stocks are reduced to low levels. It is a good example of what is good for the short term is not good for the long term. Also, what is good for some fishermen is not good for all of them (tragedy of the commons). The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in a 2018 report that 33.1% of world fish stocks are subject to overfishing.

So much fish is caught that there are too few adults of certain species left. With cod, for example, the greatest production of eggs is from large females. But these are caught, the average size of spawning females goes down. Eventually this gets so that the production of eggs is significantly reduced. The artificial selection of large fish has gradually reduced the size of mature females.

The Northwest Atlantic cod has been regarded as heavily overfished throughout its range, resulting in a crash in the fishery in the United States and Canada during the early 1990s. Sometimes, the fishing industry can ruin itself by overfishing. The collapse of the herring industry in Monterey, California is a good example. 

Consumers can get information about the conservation status of the seafood available to them.
Examples of overfishing can be found in places like the North Sea, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the East China Sea.

There are many ways that have been suggested to stop overfishing. They are:


School holiday

School holidays are the periods when schools close for a break. The dates and length of school holidays are very different throughout the world. Governments often pass laws on the total number of school days for public schools. Private schools usually decide their own holidays.

In all Christan countries and some countries with different religions there are holidays called Christmas Holidays where people don't have to go to school and they can spend time with their families. Usually in the Northern Hemisphere Christmas holidays last for about 2 weeks. But in the Southern Hemisphere, it is summer holidays so the Christmas Holidays usually last from about 6-14 weeks depending on the country.

Christan countries also celebrate the Easter holidays which can last for about a week or two weeks. In the Northern Hemisphere this is also known as Spring break because it is Spring during Easter in the Northern Hemisphere while in the Southern Hemisphere these are just known as the Easter holidays because it is Autunm over there.

In places like America, summer vacation usually lasts from June until September (14 weeks) while in other places like England, summer vacation (or known as summer holidays over there) last for about 6 weeks from late July until the begining of September because they have a 2 week holiday for Christmas and a 2 week holiday for Easter and several 1 week holidays. In places like Australia, because they're in the Southern Hemisphere, they have their holidays for about 6 weeks like England but have their holidays from about mid December to late January because they have the two two week holidays like England and an extra two week holiday in October without having the extra one week holidays.
