The B-side of the single, "Johnny Bye Bye" - Just before he was sentenced to three years for violating the Mann Act in 1962, Chuck Berry wrote "Bye Bye Johnny", a sequel to "Johnny B. Goode", where a mother sent her musician son off to Hollywood to be a star. "She drew out all her money from the Southern Trust, and put her little boy aboard the Greyhound Bus." It was not a big hit for Berry, but Springsteen decided to use those lines in 1981, for a new song that used most of the lyrics from "Come On Let's Go Tonight", calling it "Johnny Bye-Bye". Springsteen had first started performing it in 1981 at the tail end of The River Tour. It was then recorded in April 1982 during the "Electric Nebraska" sessions. The official version was recorded on January 4, 1983, at Thrill Hill West, Los Angeles, CA, and one of the mixes was released on February 6, 1985, as the B-side to "I'm On Fire". The song appeared on preliminary song lists for inclusion on what would become "Born in the U.S.A." but was ultimately left off the final album.

Anténor Firmin

Anténor Firmin (October 18, 1850 – September 19, 1911) was a Haitian scholar, anthropologist, and philosopher. He is famous for writing "De l’égalité des races humaines" (English: The Equality of the Human Races) and his Pan-African activism. In his work, Firmin opposed the racialist anthropology of the nineteenth century and rejected the idea of racial hierarchy.

Anténor Firmin was born on October 18, 1850, to a working-class family in northern Haiti. Firmin completed all of his education in Haiti. As a student, he studied classical languages and civilizations of Europe; read anthropological writings of European scholars. Later he studied law.

In 1881 Firmin married his neighbor Rosa Salnave, the daughter of the ex-president of Haiti Sylvain Salnave. She had lighter skin, and other people saw their marriage as a “mismatch” because of the tension between black people and mulattos in Haitian society at that time.

In 1883 he came to Paris as a Haitian diplomat. The next year he joined the Society of Anthropology of Paris, where he began writing "De l’égalité des races humaines". In 1888 Firmin returned to Haiti and became Minister of Finance, Commerce, and Foreign Relations.

His major anthropological work, "De l’égalité des races humaines", was published in 1884. At that time, Western scholars did not pay attention to it. One possible explanation is that Firmin wrote in French. His work became widely known only in 2000 when it was published in English under "The Equality of the Human Races". Today it is one of the most important works in anthropology.

In "The Equality of the Human Races," Firmin contradicted the ideas of racialist physical anthropology that were very popular at that time. He chose the title of his work in response to a famous essay by French diplomat and writer Arthur de Gobineau – "Essai sur L'inegalite des Races Humaines" (English: Essay on the Inequality of Human Races)"." Gobineau’s essay was the first to promote white superiority over Black people. Firmin had the opposite opinion. He believed that all people have the same qualities and weaknesses and that all races are equal. Firmin gained inspiration from August Comte, and gave his book a subtitle "Anthropologie Positive" (English: Positive Anthropology). As a positivist, Firmin believed that a new science of anthropology, positive anthropology, should study physical and intellectual characteristics of the human species without categorizing them into races. He supported a broader approach in anthropology without too much focus on the physical measurement of human racial differences.

Anténor Firmin was against any hierarchy of races and believed that racial typing was non-scientific. He disagreed with the existing racial types, for example, Ethiopian/Black or Caucasian/White, because they did not include mixed races. Firmin also challenged the anthropologists who used the method of anthropometry (measurement of the human body). A physician, anatomist, and anthropologist Paul Broca was one of his main intellectual opponents. Broca was a dominant figure in French anthropology in the 19th century.

There are two major views on the origin of the human races. Those who support monogenism believe that the races developed from common roots. Polygenists think that they originated from separate roots. Anténor Firmin did not have a clear position on that topic; he thought each view had its advantages and disadvantages. But by today’s standards, he could be called a monogenist.

Firmin was an activist in the early Pan-African movement. He studied African antiquity as a student and praised the accomplishments of African peoples. He was one of the first to state that Egyptian civilization gave origin to the Greek and Roman cultures. Although unknown in the field of anthropology, Firmin’s "The Equality of the Human Races" became a significant work of Pan-Africanism.

Magnetopause

The magnetopause is the border between a magnetosphere and the surrounding plasma. For planetary science, the magnetopause is the border between the planet's magnetic field and the solar wind. The location of the magnetopause is figured out by the balance between the pressure of the dynamic planetary magnetic field and the energetic pressure of the solar wind. As the solar wind pressure increases and decreases, the magnetopause moves inward and outward in response. Waves (ripples and flapping movement) along the magnetopause move in the direction of the solar wind flow in response to small-scale different versions in the solar wind pressure and to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. 

The solar wind is supersonic and passes through a bow shock where the direction of flow is changed so that most of the solar wind plasma is pushed-aside to either side of the magnetopause, much like water is pushed-aside before the bow of a ship. The zone of shocked solar wind plasma is the magnetosheath. At Earth and all the other planets with built-in magnetic fields, some solar wind plasma succeeds in entering and becoming trapped within the magnetic field around the Earth. At Earth, the solar wind plasma which enters the magnetic field around the Earth forms the plasma sheet. The amount of solar wind plasma and energy that enters the magnetic field around the Earth is controlled by the direction of pointing of the interplanetary magnetic field, which is deeply set within the solar wind.

The Sun and other stars with magnetic fields and stellar winds have a solar magnetopause or heliopause where the stellar environment is regional by the interstellar environment.

Paper Mario: The Origami King

Paper Mario: The Origami King is the sixth installment in the Paper Mario series, released on the Nintendo Switch worldwide on July 17, 2020. The game follows Mario opposing an evil army of origami characters known as Folded Soldiers, ruled by the Origami King, King Olly; which have taken over the Mushroom Kingdom.

The game follows the gameplay style of its two predecessors, Paper Mario: Sticker Star, and Paper Mario: Color Splash. As in these previous entries, role-playing elements are deemphasized in favor of action-adventure mechanics, which focus on exploration and puzzle-solving in individual areas rather than emphasizing character growth over the entire game. Also like the previous games, Paper Mario: The Origami King is focused around an aspect of arts and crafts. Whilst Paper Mario: Sticker Star had a focus on stickers and Paper Mario: Color Splash had a focus on paint, Paper Mario: The Origami King is focused around origami. Similarly, the game's environments graphically resemble crafts, and many of the game's bosses are based around some kind of crafting tool. Unlike the entries directly before, however, Paper Mario: The Origami King has levels that are directly connected rather than being segregated through a level select screen, similar to the first two games in the series. Similar to Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Super Paper Mario, Bowser is not the primary antagonist in exchange for an original villain. Paper Mario: The Origami King does not feature a battle system which uses finite items for combat, as it instead uses an original ring-based system which uses puzzle-solving instead of strategy.

The "Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax" refers to the Chaonians as separate from the Illyrians.

The Chaonians were settled "Kata Komas" (), meaning in a group of villages, and established a tribal state in the 5th century BC. 

The Greek historian Thucydides says that their leaders were chosen yearly and names two such leaders: Photius and Nikanor.

They were connected to other Greek tribes in Epirus () such as the Thesprotians and Molossians. The Chaonians joined the Epirote League, a federation of Greek tribes founded in 325/320 BC that ruled Epirus until the Romans conquered the region in 170 BC.

John Ratcliffe (governor)

John Ratcliffe was an explorer and colonist from England. In 1607, Ratcliffe became governor of Jamestown in Virginia and in 1609, Ratcliffe was executed by a group of Pamunkey who killed him by flaying him.

When Ratcliffe was born in 1549, he was named John Sicklemore. By 1605, he changed his name to Ratcliffe.

Ratcliffe sailed to Virginia as captain of a ship called The Discovery in 1607. At the time, Governor Edward Maria Wingfield was stealing food from his people for himself so Ratcliffe worked with Captain John Smith to get Wingfield to lose his position so Ratcliffe could become the new governor. 

Ratcliffe sent Captain Smith to trade with the Native Americans and the colonists were angry since they thought that Ratcliffe was giving too much away. Ratcliffe also had them build a palace for the Governor when a lot of people in Virginia were sick and dying so they made Ratcliffe resign. 

In 1609, Ratcliffe was Captain of a group of Englishmen who wanted to trade with the Powhatan giving them copper to get corn. Ratcliffe came with 25 men to the meeting he had arranged with the Powhatan but found it was a trap. They killed 23 of Ratcliffe’s men and also tortured Ratcliffe to death but the other two got away and told everyone what had happened. Powhatan women tied mussel shells to Ratcliffe so that they could tear his skin from his body set it on fire and then killed him by burning what was left of his body.

Ratcliffe is the villain of the Disney movie Pocahontas (1995 film) where he wants all the gold in Virginia and wants to kill all Powhatan because he’s greedy and racist and he’s also in the sequel where he tries to get King James VI and I to let him murder all Powhatan for revenge.

Ceremonial first pitch

A ceremonial first pitch is a tradition in baseball. It is when a special person throws a ball to mark the start of the game. The person used to throw the ball to the pitcher of the home team from their seat. This changed when United States President Ronald Reagan threw a pitch from the field, similar to how a pitcher threw the ball. Because of Reagan, the person now stands in front of the pitcher's mound and throws the ball to home plate. The person who catches the ball is often from the home team. The tradition was first done in the United States in the 1800s.

The person is often a celebrity or other important person who is at the game. It may also be an important person from a company to gives money to the baseball team, or somebody who won a contest to throw the first pitch. Sometimes many first pitches are thrown.

Tendon locking

Tendon locking is used by many animal species which sleep in trees or caves. It lets them sleep without falling off. The system has evolved separately in a number of vertebrates, so it is an example of parallel evolution.

The leg arrangement of passerine birds has a special adaption for perching: a "tendon-locking mechanism". A tendon in the rear of the leg is automatically pulled and tightened when the leg bends. This makes the foot curl stiffly round when the bird lands on a branch. The tendon is locked in place by another tendon. So passerines sleep while perching without falling off.

Small animals which sleep in trees or caves usually hang on with their feet: they have a tendon locking device which keeps them hanging on even during sleep. It works by one tendon running down the leg shifting position slightly so it grips the tendon which closes the toes. Bats independently evolved a similar arrangement. Once the tendons are locked, the muscles in their legs and feet can relax. Even dead bats stay hanging. These various examples have evolved independently of each other: this is known from the fine details of the mechanism. One plus of a locking mechanism is that it allows attachment to slender branches on which predators might be unable to walk.

There are various group behaviours which supplement the effect of
tendon locking. The most obvious is complete silence. Starlings migrate in large groups, and they can go from making a huge noise to complete silence after landing on an overnight roost.

Meir Zvi Bergman

Rabbi Meir Zvi Bergman (born in 1930) is the head of the Rashbi Yeshiva and a member of the Torah Elders Council of Degel HaTorah.

Born in Jerusalem between the walls to Rabbi Moshe Bergman and Alta Liva Raizil, daughter of Rabbi Yona Ze'ev Hershler. He is seventh generation in Jerusalem, descendant of Rabbi Eliezer Bergman.

He was orphaned by his mother who contracted typhus when he was seven years old. In the 1950s, his father settled in Miron, and was among the founders of the Bnei Akiva Yeshiva there. In the year 5575 his father moved to Bnei Brak and founded the Rashbi yeshiva there.

In 1971, he studied for a year at a small yeshiva in the Mekor Haim neighborhood led by Rabbi Moshe Tikocinski, later the overseer of the Slabodka Yeshiva.

At the age of 11, he began studying at Yeshiva Tefarat Zion with Rabbi Michal Yehuda Lipkowitz. During his studies he stayed for about two years in the house of the "Chazon Ish" with whom he studied. After that, he studied at Yeshiva Lomza in Petach Tikva with Rabbi Reuven Katz, the overseer Rabbi Eliyahu Doshnitzer and Rabbi Elazar Menachem Man Shach - who later became his father-in-law. At Yeshiva Lomza he studied in company with his friend Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, who later said that he studied with 'Rabbi Meir' (as he called Rabbi Bergman) more than twenty tractates in study!

In 8th of Sivan 5771 he married Deborah, the daughter of Rabbi Shach. The Kiddoshin was arranged by a relative of the family, Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer. The matchmaker was the Chazon Ish. After his marriage, he studied in Kollel Chazon Ish, in fellowship with Rabbi Ya'akov Israel Kanievsky, with his friend from the Lomeja Yeshiva Rabbi Gedaliah Nadel and with Rabbi Haim Kanievsky. Rabbi Bergman served as a public emissary during the terrible days at the Chazon Ish, and after his death at the temple including the Chazon Ish. Later, Rabbi Ya'akov Israel Kanievsky asked to serve in this position at the Beit Meir yeshiva.

He taught at the Kalatsak-Rehovot Yeshiva (the South Yeshiva) where his father-in-law, Rabbi Shach, served earlier.

After that, at the behest of his father-in-law, he founded the Rashbi's Kollel in the Zichron Meir neighborhood in Bnei Brak, in which he gives lessons and talks to the abrachs. With the establishment of the kollel, Rabbi Shach financed the salaries of the abrachs, and later Rabbi Shach ordered him to travel abroad for the sake of holding the kollel. In the second decade of the 21st century, he stopped traveling abroad, and his son Rabbi Ben Zion assists in the management and holding of the kollel.

Over the years, he avoided engaging in public affairs , with the exception of exceptional cases, such as in the year of the establishment of the Degal HaTorah movement, when he served as the emissary of his father-in-law, the movement's founder , Rabbi Shach, in all matters related to the establishment and success of the new movement. Also, before the special elections for the Prime Minister - 2001, the newspaper Yad Naman published his decision to vote for Ariel Sharon, even though going to the polls is not for the purpose of choosing an ultra-Orthodox party.

On the eve of Pesach in the year 5773, he was appointed to serve as a member of the Council of Torah Elders of Degel HaTorah together with Rabbi Shmuel Auerbach and Rabbi Gershon Edelstein. Since then he began to engage and express his opinion in public matters. During the controversy in the Lithuanian public, he refrained from taking an active position, but continued to support the Torah Banner Party and the newspaper Yated Naman.

In his conversations, he usually refers to issues of opinion that are on the agenda of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, in which he echoes the conservative teachings of his father-in-law, Rabbi Shach, such as the issue of Jewish immigration to the Temple Mount, the return of territories, and the recruitment of Yeshiva members. It is considered an authority by many Torah scholars as representing the opinion of Rabbi Shach who is accepted in the yeshiva world as the father of the ultra-orthodox view in the modern generation, and from time to time we consult him and use his testimonies about Rabbi Shach's instructions and positions.

In the 2020 elections in the United State, he publicly supported President Donald Trump because he is "good for the Jews". After the attack in the city of Bnei Brak on March 29, 2022, he attacked the calls directed to the ultra-orthodox sector to obtain a license to possess weapons.

After the disaster at Hilult, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai called for a poignant soul-searching in the ultra-orthodox public, in view of the many differences that exist between each other, saying that the disaster is measure against measure because "we push each other".

Married to Deborah, daughter of Rabbi Shach. The couple has nine children, eight sons and a daughter.


His brothers-in-law are Rabbi Yisrael Zvi Yair Danziger the Rebbe of Alexander , and Rabbi Yaakov Goldman Rabbi of Zweihel Chassidism in Bnei Brak, father of Rabbi Eliezer <nowiki>Goldman</nowiki> the Rebbe of Zweihel in the United States.

Today, it operates as a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. It is also distributed by Republic Records, formerly Universal Republic. The label currently includes artists like Lil Wayne, Drake, Tyga, Nicki Minaj, Ace Hood, DJ Khaled, Kevin Rudolf and Limp Bizkit, and more.
Cash Money Records was created in 1991.

From 1991 to 1994, Cash Money played host to local releases by artists. It sold just one album with never releasing a music video or having a "Billboard" hit. Some of the label's releases garnered some regional fame in New Orleans, Louisiana, but the label was little known to the national rap spotlight. Artists on the label in this period included the band U.N.L.V. (Uptown Niggas Living Violently), Kilo G, Lil Slim, and PxMxWx. In 1995, the label signed young rappers B.G., Young Buck and Lil Wayne. The signees marked what would be the second wave of Cash Money artists. In 1997, B.G. and Lil Wayne formed the band Hot Boys together with Juvenile (who had already been regionally popular before Cash Money). Although initially they did not make lots of impact outside of the region, they started to be the label's best known artists.

Cash Money's big break came in 1998. That was when the Hot Boys, B.G. and Juvenile in particular, caught the attention of Universal Records executives. In 1998, Cash Money signed a $30 million pressing and distribution with $3 million advance contract with Universal, entitling the label to 85% of its royalties, 50% of its publishing revenues and ownership of all masters. Dino Delvaille, who orchestrated the deal, later told HitQuarters: "I made certain they retained 100% ownership of their work. They deserve it."

Shabbos goy

A Shabbos goy is a Gentile who is asked by a Jew to do something on the Sabbath or one of the Jewish holidays that halakha says Jews can’t do on the Sabbath (or on the Jewish holidays).

Shabbos is a Yiddish way of pronouncing the Hebrew word Shabbat meaning the Sabbath. In the Torah, goy is Hebrew for nation so the Almighty says He will make the Israelites into a “goy gadol” (a great nation). But because of that, the Tanakh also says “Israel ve’ha’goyim” meaning Israel and the nations with the word goyim, which means nations, implying the other nations. Because of that the word Goyim eventually started being used to mean Gentiles with Goy meaning Gentile. So that Shabbos Goy literally means Sabbath Gentile.

Evolutionary medicine

Evolutionary medicine or Darwinian medicine is a way to think about how and why evolution changed human bodies over time to make people sick or healthy. People use Darwinian medicine to study biomolecules. It is used understand how these small molecules work together through something called physiological mechanisms. Physiological mechanisms are things that bodies do that make people feel either sick or healthy. People who study Darwinian medicine use these ideas to learn how those mechanisms have changed over time. Understanding these changes can be important to know why some people are more likely to be sick than others.

Darwinian medicine comes from ideas that came from Charles Darwin. Charles Darwin had many ideas. The ideas that helped form Darwinian medicine came from his work on germ theory of disease. Many biologists learned of these ideas and quickly saw how they could help people think about how pathogens evolve and how people change to protect themselves from these pathogens. Scientific papers that have been written about the field of Darwinian medicine. They include a paper by Paul Ewald, in 1980, named “Evolutionary Biology and the Treatment of Signs and Symptoms of Infectious Disease”. Another paper written by Williams and Nesse, “The Dawn of Darwinian Medicine” (1991), was also important to the growth of the field. These papers made people think more about Darwinian medicine. A book called “Why We Get Sick” and an online journal, “Evolution and Medicine Review" (2008), have also had large effects on the subject. 

Experts who practice Darwinian medicine use 5 main ideas when thinking about health. These main ideas help experts to decide what things might affect the ability to be sick or healthy. Below is a list of these ideas and their meanings for Darwinian medicine. 

There are some adaptations that have changed traits over time. Some of these adaptations have made people more healthy. There are constraints that keep some traits from changing. The presence of constraints means that adaptations that could make people more likely to be healthy are not able to happen. These adaptations can happen but with trade-offs. This could mean changes in one trait that make people healthy might lead to changes in other traits that make people sick.



A long time ago, humans used to hunt and gather food and live in small tribes. The way humans have evolved shows this. There are communities today that still live a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. There are also people who have a very different way of living than their ancestors did. Evolution takes a long time to happen. It has not caught up with how many people are living today. Some experts in Darwinian medicine believe that people who do not practice a hunter-gatherer lifestyle are more likely to have problems being healthy. This idea of our evolution not matching the way many humans live today and it causing health problems is called “diseases of civilization” or “diseases of affluence”. 

Many people eat types of food that are much different than what people ate a long time ago. A long time ago people ate things that grew from the ground. They also ate animals from the land or sea. Today, there are more options of what to eat. Some options we have are foods that are made in factories. These foods often have large amounts of sugar, salt and fat. These things are not good for people to eat in large amounts. They can lead to sickness. Some examples of sickness that can come from these things are dental caries, obesity and diabetes. 

How long a person lives can be affected by the way they live. There are many sicknesses that are more common now than they were a long time ago. Some of these include cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, cataracts, hypertension and Alzheimer’s disease. All of these sicknesses are more likely to happen the older a person gets.

A long time ago, more people used to exercise more than people do now. They lived lives that needed more physical activity. When a person would rest, mechanisms in the body would change. This would lead to inflammation. Some people believe that people who do not exercise have more inflammation in their bodies. This can cause more sicknesses. 

People a long time ago were less clean than people are now. Being clean has helped people be more healthy. There are trade-offs to being clean. There are some microorganisms that humans need to have strong immune systems. Some microorganisms that grow strong immune systems can come from dirt and animals. Without these microorganisms, people may have weak immune systems. This means they could be more likely to get sick.

Waist chop

Waist chop or waist cutting, was an Imperial Chinese form of execution. The victim was cut into two pieces at the waist with a big sharp knife or sword.

Waist chopping was first used during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1046 BC – 256 BC). It was one of three ways people were executed:

There is a story that the poet, Yu Hongtu was killed by waist chop in 1734. Before he died, he wrote seven lines of the Chinese character "cân" (cruel,naughty) with his own blood.

Sometimes the chopping was more than one cut. The first Ming dynasty emperor Zhu Yuanzhang had the poet Gao Qi cut into eight parts for his politically satirical writing.

In the modern Chinese language, "waist chop" has become a metaphor for the cancellation of an ongoing project, especially television programs.

Blame It on the Boogie

"Blame It on the Boogie" is a disco song. It was originally released in 1978 both by English singer-songwriter Mick Jackson and (in its most famous version) by The Jacksons (no relation). It was later also covered by many other artists.
The song was co-written by Mick Jackson (credited as Michael George Jackson-Clarke) as well as Mick's brother, David Jackson and Elmar Krohn.

Although Mick Jackson recorded the song in 1977, "Blame It on the Boogie" was written in hopes of selling it to Stevie Wonder.

The Mick Jackson track was showcased in 1978 at Midem where, according to Mick Jackson: "The Jacksons' manager [Peter Kerstin] heard the track being played...and took a recording of it...back in the States [where] The Jacksons quickly recorded a version so it would be out before mine." In fact, the Mick Jackson recording was released by Atlantic Records in the United States in August 1978.

According to Michael Jackson of the Jacksons, Bobby Colomby, who was producing the Jacksons' "Destiny" album, brought the group "Blame It on the Boogie". "It was an uptempo, finger-poppin'-time type song that was a good vehicle for the band approach we wanted to cultivate. I had fun slurring the chorus: [the lyric] 'Blame It on the Boogie' could be sung in one breath without putting my lips together."

Philips Records

Philips Records is a record label. It was founded by the Dutch electronics company Philips. It was started by "Philips Phonographische Industrie" (PPI) in 1950. Recordings were made with popular artists of various nationalities and also with classical artists from Germany, France and the Netherlands. Philips also distributed recordings made by the American Columbia Records on the European continent. After the split of English Columbia and American Columbia in late 1954, Philips also began distributing original Columbia recordings on the Philips label in the UK.
In 1958, Philips created a subsidiary label, Fontana Records, which meant that American-Columbia recordings were released on the Philips and Fontana labels. Under the direction of US President of Columbia Records, Goddard Lieberson, in late 1964 CBS Records formed its own international operations, adopting the name of its then parent CBS. CBS established their UK operation on Theobalds Road in Holborn. Products issued by Philips and Fontana Columbia were later withdrawn. 
Philips Records and Deutsche Grammophon were linked into the Gramophon-Philips Group (GPG) joint venture, which later became PolyGram in 1972. UK pressings were manufactured at the company's large factory based at Walthamstow, North East London.

In 1964, after Philips lost its North American distribution deal with Columbia Records, it signed a sawp deal with Mercury Records. A year later, Philips' US subsidiary "Consolidated Electronics Industries Corp." (also known as "Conelco"), bought Mercury and its subsidiary labels, like Smash. Philips classical, jazz and pop records were marketed by Mercury in the US under the Philips label. The Mercury Living Presence team also made classical recordings for Philips, in July 1961. These records, made in Walthamstow Town Hall near London, included: Liszt piano concertos by Sviatoslav Richter and the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Kiril Kondrashin; two albums of symphonic "bon-bons" by the London Symphony Orchestra and Charles Mackerras released as "Kaleidoscope"; "Russian Song Recital" by Galina Vishnevskaya and Mstislav Rostropovich; and Beethoven sonata op. 69 for cello and piano by Richter and Rostropovich. The Richter Liszt album was recorded on 3-track 35mm magnetic film and was reissued on CD from a remaster made from the film by original producer Wilma Cozart Fine, (wife of the late recording pioneer Bob) as part of the Philips Solo series.

Classical groups that Philips heavily recorded included the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Beaux Arts Trio, and the Quartetto Italiano. The violinist Arthur Grumiaux and the pianist Claudio Arrau were under contract with Philips. Symphony orchestras under contract, including the LSO, were led by prestigious young conductors such as Colin Davis and Bernard Haitink.

DJM Records

DJM Records was Dick James's record label, distributed by Pye Records in the UK and various others around the world. DJM is an abbreviation of Dick James Music. Elton John was very prominent in DJM (except in the US and Canada, where he was signed to MCA Records) before moving in 1976 to his own Rocket Records. The very first release on this label was by Dave Sealy entitled "It Takes A Thief" which was adapted from a television series theme song for which lyrics were written. It was recorded with the Zack Laurence orchestra. Frank Neilson was A&R manager from 1976 to 1979, before moving to Polydor Records.

Other acts on the label in the 1970s included Mr. Bloe, who included pianist Zack Laurence and harmonica player Harry Pitch; former Fleetwood Mac member Danny Kirwan, who recorded three albums for DJM, "Second Chapter" (1975), "Midnight In San Juan" (1976), and "Hello There Big Boy!" (1979); The Tremeloes, after their departure from CBS/Epic in 1974; singer-turned-actor Dennis Waterman; Johnny "Guitar" Watson; and various session musicians who had worked with Elton John. The latter sued the label in the 1980s over the rights to his earlier (pre-1976) work.

Roger Hodgson, before joining Supertramp, released a single on DJM (Congress in the U.S.) under the name "Argosy".

After Dick James's death in 1986, PolyGram acquired the DJM catalogue. 

A Single Man (album)

A Single Man is an album. It is by British singer-songwriter Elton John. It was released in 1978.
It is the first of John's albums not to feature long-time collaborators Bernie Taupin (lyricist) and Gus Dudgeon (producer). As Gary Osborne was unknown at the time, many people misinterpreted the album's title to imply that John wrote the entire album himself. The only returning members of his band are percussionist Ray Cooper and guitarist Davey Johnstone; the latter only played on one song on the album. Paul Buckmaster did not appear on another Elton John album until "Made in England".

Unlike previous compositions where the lyrics came first, John began writing melodies at a piano and it unintentionally became an album.
The hit "Song for Guy" was a tribute to Guy Burchett, a young messenger for Rocket Records who was killed in a motorcycle accident. The song was a near-global hit, reaching charts high everywhere except in the US and Canada, where John's label, MCA Records, did not feel it had any potential, due to the recent success of the instrumental "Music Box Dancer".

The songs "Return To Paradise" and "Song For Guy" are used in the 1980 film Oh! Heavenly Dog.

Breaking Hearts

Breaking Hearts is the eighteenth studio album by British singer-songwriter Elton John, released in 1984. It features the quartet of John, Davey Johnstone, Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson. There were two hit singles from the album: the US #5 hit "Sad Songs (Say So Much)" and the UK No. 5 hit "Passengers".

This was the last studio album until 2001's "Songs from the West Coast" to feature Olsson on drums. It was also the last where John played both piano and keyboards in the studio solo. There was a backup keyboard player for each album moving forward.

"Breaking Hearts" was also the first album since "Victim of Love" not to feature a string or horn section on any track. This is one of only two albums with John's classic band where Ray Cooper was not part of the lineup, the other being 1973's "Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player".

I Found a Way

"I Found a Way" (also known as "Found a Way") is a song by American actor and singer Drake Bell, from the Nickelodeon show "Drake & Josh"s soundtrack album of the same name (2005), and Bell's first album "Telegraph" (2005). The song was written by Bell and Michael Corcoran, one of Bell's friends and band members. 

"I Found a Way" is a pop and alternative rock song that refers to the relationship between the two main characters of the show. Dan Schneider, the producer of the TV show "Drake and Josh", loved "I Found a Way" and decided to use it as the show's theme song. Bell has sung "I Found a Way" at many of his concerts over the years.

In September 2018, American singer and actor Drake Bell talked to American animator Butch Hartman about the theme song for the TV show "Drake & Josh". He said that it was going to be a song by American Lenny Kravitz. The show's American producer, Dan Schneider, asked Bell how much of his own music he wanted to use for the show. Bell wanted to be a "rock star" and was happy to write music for the show. He told his friend and bandmate Michael Corcoran that they should write a theme song for "Drake & Josh" that could be connected to the show since everyone was listening to Kravitz at the time.

Bell and Corcoran tried to create a theme song for Drake & Josh, but they couldn't come up with anything good. So they decided to write a regular song instead, which was inspired by English singer Elvis Costello. The song was about helping your brother when they're feeling sad. They made a short recording of the song in 2003. Later on, Bell played the recording for Schneider. Schneider was worried about hurting Bell's feelings if he didn't like the song, but Bell told him to listen. Schneider loved the song and used it as the show's theme song.

"I Found a Way" was released on February 22, 2005, as the first song on the soundtrack album for the Nickelodeon show "Drake & Josh". Later on, August 23, 2005, the song was released again under the title "Found a Way" as the second song on Bell's first album, "Telegraph".

"I Found a Way" is a pop and alternative rock, according to Chloe Barns of the magazine "Collider." Barns also said that the song is about the relationship between the two main characters of the show. Bell explained that his fans would often sing the chorus with the incorrect lyrics: "If you open up your mind/See what's inside/It's gonna take some time to realize." However, Bell said that the correct lyrics are "It's gonna take some time to re-align."

Many critics liked the song. Taylor Ferber, who writes for "Bustle" magazine, said it was really catchy and perfect for getting people in a good mood. Lauren Hazlewood from "Fashion" magazine also said it was catchy. The people who work for the magazine "Iowa City Press-Citizen" said it was a very important song for Bell. Ashley Amber from "Collider" said the song made people feel nostalgic, while Maria Serra of "Alternative Press" liked the track, called it a "banger".

Critics have said that "I Found a Way" is one of the best theme songs from the 2000s. Crystal Bell from MTV put the song as the fourth best Nickelodeon theme song, saying it was a really catchy tune. Tobi Gbile from "Bustle" also put it at number four on his list of childhood theme songs that give people feelings, saying that it was one of his favorite songs and became really popular in the mid-2000s. Both Nick Caruso and Matt Webb Mitovich from "TVLine" also put the song to their list of the top TV theme songs from 2000-2009.

At a meet and greet at Heroes Comics in Fresno, California in 2018, Bell sang "I Found a Way" with one of his fans before his concert. During one of his concerts in 2020, the actor sang "I Found a Way". When the audience sang "It's gonna take some time to realize", he stopped them and said that the correct word was "realign" instead of "realize". After correcting them, he played the song again. During another one of his 2020 concerts, Bell also performed the song for Jonathan Goldstein, the actor who played Walter Nichols, the father in "Drake & Josh". In March 2021, Bell performed "I Found a Way" live at a drive-in concert in Tucson, Arizona.

In August 2016, Bell's former co-star, Josh Peck, also an American actor, shared a video on Instagram of John Stamos, another American actor, singing his own version of "I Found a Way". In the video, Stamos sang, "Drake and Josh. Everybody loves Drake and Josh.""I Found a Way" is played in two different episodes of the TV show "iCarly". In one episode called "iGo Nuclear," it's played at a smoothie restaurant. In another episode called "iGot A Hot Room," actors Jennette McCurdy and Nathan Kress sing it during the closing credits while Miranda Cosgrove sings the theme song to "iCarly".

Child Rebel Soldier

Child Rebel Soldier, abbreviated CRS, was a hip hop supergroup consisting of hip hop artists and record producers Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and Pharrell Williams.
Child Rebel Soldier was conceived with the conception of the song "Us Placers", which appears on Kanye West's mixtape "Can't Tell Me Nothing" (2007), released just before his third studio album "Graduation" (2007). Lupe Fiasco produced the song in an attempt to construct a mashup mixtape containing hip hop remakes of alternative rock singer Thom Yorke's solo album "The Eraser", along with a few Radiohead songs. He originally wanted Kanye West and English rapper The Streets to feature on the mixtape's first track "Us Placers", but Skinner did not respond as West sent the song to Pharrell Williams after writing a verse. After ending the collaboration, the trio decided to form a group, billed by Pharrell as "Child Rebel Soldier". Their first song, "Us Placers", was ranked number 43 on "Rolling Stone"'s magazines list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007.

In a 2007 interview with "Billboard", Fiasco explained that the three hoped to find time to build a full-length studio album, saying, "Now [our labels are] working it out. Whoever is going to pay is going to pay a whole hell of a lot. Everybody is excited, [but] 'Us Placers' is the only record we have".

On January 29, 2008, it was announced on Kanye West's blog that the three artists would be touring together later in the year. The Glow in the Dark Tour, as it was called, consisted of Kanye West, Rihanna, Lupe Fiasco and Pharrell's funk rock band N.E.R.D.

According to an interview by Lupe Fiasco with sohh.com, there were plans for a CRS album in 2010. He said that the CRS trio would have three different items: an album, music videos, and a third item that he did not elaborate on (speculation that what he was referring to at this point was the unannounced "Glow in the Dark" tour at the time).

The group was featured on a N.E.R.D.'s "Everyone Nose" remix. They were labeled as Child Rebel Soldier in the song instead of their separate entities. This is the second song where they use their group name. The official video for the remix version of "Everyone Nose" was posted on Kanye West's blog on August 7, 2008. The video, directed by Hype Williams, features CRS and Pusha T of Clipse. Behind them is a green screen showing scenes from various retro video games, including "Donkey Kong", "Galaga", and "Space Invaders".

On July 25, 2013, in response to a reply on Twitter, Lupe Fiasco announced that Child Rebel Soldier was disbanded.

Unlike many other contemporary R&B videos, the video for "A Woman's Worth"'s video was a low-key clip with no dance. It was nominated for Best R&B Video and Best Cinematography at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards.

When Keys' boyfriend is released from jail, he is frustrated by his failed attempt to find a job. Meanwhile, Keys realizes that she's not paying much attention to him, so she worries that her boyfriend is putting her job frustration before her girlfriend, to which Keys explains, "You'll lose if you decide to refuse to do it." put her first."

The video begins with Keys walking down the street and singing "Fallin'" as she listens to it on her headphones. A street kid sees her and joins her in saying, "Hey yo shorty, what's up? You looking good today. So you gon' give me some time or what?" Keys replies, "What you talking about, shorty? What you know about a woman's worth?"

The next scene shows the street kid from the beginning of the video having dinner with his parents. She sees that her parents are in conflict and begin to argue in front of the boy. The father then smashes his plate of food on the floor and walks out of the house, leaving his wife in tears and the boy in shock. Later, he goes into her mother's bedroom to comfort her. Intercut shots show Keys outside an apartment building in a courtyard alone with her piano as she sings.

The first six songs are models of how to make nostalgic music that is not anti-present... The second half of Diary sags."

Giving the album four stars, "People" magazine said that "Keys honors R&B's golden age with an old soul far beyond her 23 years." "Billboard" magazine felt that "the songstress handily tops "Songs in A Minor"" and "channels spirits of '60s and '70s soul for "Diary"." "Rolling Stone" called the album "an assured, adult statement, steeped in the complicated love life and musical dreams of an ambitious young woman", comparing Keys to Nina Simone and Aretha Franklin. ABC News said "If I Ain't Got You" is "a stunner of a ballad on which Keys' sound and vocal inflection recalled another one of Davis' famous proteges: Whitney Houston."
At the 2005 Grammy Awards, "The Diary of Alicia Keys" won Best R&B Album and also earned Keys two other awards: Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for "If I Ain't Got You" and Best R&B Song for "You Don't Know My Name".

Chopper (rap)

Chopper is a style of hip hop music. It originated in the Midwest. It is considered the main contribution to rap music by Midwestern hip hop artists. The style of rap first gained popularity in the mid-1990s with the emergence of hip hop in the Midwest and the rise of award-winning rap artists such as Cleveland rappers Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and Chicago rapper Twista. The rap style eventually spread to other regions as well. In the late 1990s, Tech N9ne, a former underground rap artist, popularized the Chopper style among his strong fan base and in 2011 released a series of collaborative songs with other Chopper artists exclusively in this fast-paced style of rap.
The word "Chopper" can be used simply for any rapper who uses an up-tempo style in their lyrics. The term was first used in street and hip hop slang to refer to the AK-47 assault rifle. The word has also been used as an informal word for helicopter. The link to AK-47 and helicopter and their fast response times regarding their functions may have an analogous relationship to fast-paced rap. One of the first rappers to popularize this style of rap, Twista, in a song with Tech N9ne titled "Worldwide Choppers" hinted at this in his lyrics, "I'm finna be usin it as energy, watch how radiant I'ma be. Like a helicopter when the words fly."

"Chopper" used to loosely describe the fast-paced style of rap, but the use of the term became more official when rap artist Tech N9ne released a series of collaborative rap songs with other Chopper-style rap artists from around the world in 2007, 2009, and 2011 including Worldwide Choppers, Midwest Choppers, and Midwest Choppers 2.

Am I my brother's keeper?

"Am I my brother's keeper?" is a saying from the Bible. It comes from the story of Cain and Abel: After Cain murdered his brother Abel, God asked him where his brother was, and Cain answered: "I know not; am I my brother's keeper?" These words came into the English language through William Tyndale and his translation of the Bible into English.

The story is in Judaism and Christianity. It shows not only Cain's wrongness in not looking after his brother's well-being, but his hiding of the terrible crime of fratricide.

Alexander was born on July 23, 1990 in a small rural area a hundred kilometers from the city of Voronezh. From a very young age, Alexander was fond of singing and dancing, performing on stage was Alexander's childhood dream.

Acting on stage was Alexander's childhood dream. From a very early age, she sang and danced all the time. With age, the desire to express himself through creativity grew stronger, and Alexander found a path that led him to great places that he shared in concerts with pop stars in venues such as: Crocus City Hall, the Kremlin State Palace, the Central House of Music.

First there was karaoke. The most desired birthday gift for little Sasha turned out to be the karaoke that her mother gave her on her birthday.

The boy's joy knew no bounds. If other kids were ready to tirelessly chase a soccer ball, then Sasha could sing for hours to the soundtrack. Mom encouraged her son's studies, but was a strict connoisseur.

If you heard that your child was fake, did not reach the grades, you pointed this out to him, but you did not believe that creativity could become your child's profession in the future. She directed the boy towards a more mundane profession. And after graduating from school, Sasha entered a technical school to study economics.

However, even there she did not abandon her passion and enroll in a vocal and choreographic circle. I wasn't there to study. I plunged headlong into the atmosphere of creativity.

He devoted all his spare time to singing and dancing. In 2009, he joined the army, and there he found time to sing and dance, and Alexander served in the city of Perm in the Internal Troops of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.

No matter how Alexander was drawn to creativity, he had to think about life, the vital. Finding a job in the village is not easy, and in 2011 he went to Moscow, got a job as a security guard in one of the companies, so that he could at least earn extra money for the first time.

Having settled in the city, he again began to think about doing what he loved. Since July 2011, Alexander has worked as a fitness trainer, got a job at the Family Education Center, where he danced with young children 1.5 years and older. He worked part-time as a school teacher.

Cláudio (footballer, born 1922)

Cláudio Christóvam de Pinho (July 18, 1922 – May 1, 2000), better known as Cláudio, is the highest scorer of all time for Corinthians. 

He scored 306 goals in 554 games for the team, where he was nicknamed “Manager”. He was also known for being a skillful player, who placed the ball anywhere he wanted, and is usually ranked as the third best ever Corinthians player, after Rivelino and Sócrates. He played as a forward, more precisely as a right winger. He was in possession of a great technique, ability to take free kicks and penalties and a leadership character that allowed him to be nicknamed O Gerente (the manager). His style of play is comparable to that of other players who have worn the Corinthians shirt in subsequent periods, such as Marcelinho Carioca. He is widely considered as one of the best football players of all time. 
He made his debut for Santos in 1940, but moved to Palmeiras a short time later, with whom he won his first title, namely the 1942 Paulista championship. He was also the protagonist of a curious fact: in fact he scored the club's first goal after the name change from Palestra Itália to Palmeiras. The fruitful period with the São Paulo club allowed him to return to Santos, which however he left, again after less than two years, to move to Corinthians.

He made his scoring debut against his former club Palmeiras, netting from a corner kick. With Luizinho, Baltazar, Rafael, Simão and Carbone, he formed an attack capable of scoring more than one hundred goals (one hundred and three to be precise) in a single edition of the state championship, that of 1950. Cláudio's arrival at Corinthians ushered in a period of success, who broke the fast of ten years without titles for the company. In 1957 he temporarily left football to devote himself to a coaching career, which he however interrupted after only one season (1958-1959); so he returned to play, this time at the San Paolo, where despite the thirty-seven years he was the protagonist of a good year, with 10 goals scored in 35 games.

He played 31 games for Brazil, scoring 10 goals. He played for Brazil between 1942 and 1957. Although he hasn't made many appearances, he has been called up to four editions of the Campeonato Sudamericano de Football in 1942, 1949, 1953, 1957, he was left out to be selected for the 1945, 1946 and 1956 edition. He won the Copa América with Brazil in 1949. Following the injury of the starting right winger of the Tesourinha national team, Flávio Costa selected Alfredo and Friaça for the 1950 world championship instead of him and Heleno de Freitas, thus excluding Cláudio, who was at that time considered one of the best interpreters of the role. He even turned a chance down to play for the 1954 World Cup and 1958 World Cup.

He died in 2000 because of a heart attack, in Santos, the city where he was born.

The southern cricket frog, savannah cricket frog, savannah cricket, cricket frog, Florida cricket frog, southeastern cricket frog, or coastal plain cricket frog ("Acris gryllus") is a frog. It lives in the southeastern United States in Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, Mississippi, and Florida.

This frog is small. It is about 1.6-3.2 mm long from nose to rear end. It has a dark triangle mark between its eyes. There is a light stripe from the eye to the front leg.

This frog lives in lowlands and in river valleys. People have seen it near ponds, bogs, and areas with rivers. Because this frog cannot climb very well, it moves away from danger by hopping or going into the water. It can jump 2 feet (60 cm) up in the air and 3-4 feet (90-120 cm) across.

There are at least two subspecies of this frog: "Acris gryllus gryllus" and "Acris gryllus dorsalis". "A. g. gryllus" has two dark stripes with light color around them on each hind leg. It has warts near its rear end. "A. g. dorsalis" has two dark lines on each hind leg and no warts.

2022 Florida gubernatorial election

The 2022 Florida gubernatorial election was held on November 8, 2022, to elect the governor of Florida. Incumbent republican governor Ron DeSantis and incumbent republican lieutenant governor Jeanette Nuñez defeated former Florida governor Charlie Crist and Karla Hernandez-Mats on the Republican Party ticket.

Section 5 of the state's constitution states for a person to serve as governor must:


The "Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization" decision in June 2022, which overturned the 1973 "Roe v. Wade" decision and permitted U.S. states to fully ban abortion for the first time in nearly 50 years, has made abortion a more possible issue. In the 2022 election, the topic of abortion was to play a major topic within the Republican Party.

Due to mass shootings increasingly surging in the United States, the Democratic Party has advocated for an assault weapons ban. This was a major debate topic to play out in within both parties.

The Covid-19 pandemic left a major effect in Florida, leaving over more than 70,000 deaths and over 5 million confirmed cases. This was a major issue and debate topic within the Republican Party.

In late 2021, incumbent Governor Ron DeSantis announced his reelection campaign to a second term.

In April 2021, former Florida governor Charlie Crist announced his candidacy for governor to a non-consecutive term after he only served one term from 2007 to 2011.
On November 8, 2022, incumbent governor Ron DeSantis defeated Charlie Crist in a landslide victory margin along with incumbent lieutenant governor, Jeanette Nuñez as his running mate.

Asylum Records

Asylum Records is an American record label, owned by Warner Music Group. After several incarnations, today it is primarily oriented towards hip-hop, alternative metal and rock.
Asylum was founded in 1971 by David Geffen and his partner Elliot Roberts, who had previously worked an agent at the William Morris Agency and operated a folk/rock label. They founded their own management company, and when Geffen was unable to secure a recording contract for Jackson Browne, one of his clients at the time, Geffen and Roberts founded Asylum specifically to sign Browne. Asylum's first releases were distributed by Atlantic Records. The same year, Asylum signed John David Souther, Judee Sill, Linda Ronstadt, Joni Mitchell and Glenn Frey (who Geffen encouraged to form The Eagles, with Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner.) In 1972, then-folk singer-songwriter Tom Waits signed with the label and released his debut, "Closing Time", in 1973. His fifth and final album for the label, "Heartattack and Vine", was released in 1980. Asylum's crowning achievement was to sign Bob Dylan, who had been with Columbia Records since the early 1960s but, after a falling out with the company, was looking for a new label. Dylan recorded two albums, "Planet Waves" and the live "Before the Flood" for Asylum before returning to Columbia. Columbia reissued Dylan's two Asylum albums in 1981.
In 1972 Asylum was taken over by the then-Warner Communications (now Warner Music Group) and Asylum merged with Elektra Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records. David Geffen received $2 million in cash and $5 million in Warner Communications stock, making it one of the company's largest shareholders. In 1973, Geffen opened the now famous Roxy nightclub on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, which became a showcase for many up-and-coming artists. Geffen served as chairman and president of Elektra/Asylum Records until 1975, when he moved into motion pictures and was named vice president of Warner Brothers Pictures. 

One of Asylum's most notable signings after Geffen's departure was Warren Zevon, who released a string of critically acclaimed and successful LPs for the label; his self-titled 1976 label debut has been called the best California rock album of the decade.

Geffen withdrew from his business affairs for several years after a cancer scare in 1976, which later turned out to be a misdiagnosis. He returned to the business in 1980, founding the Geffen Records label and signing John Lennon, whose comeback album "Double Fantasy" was released just days before Lennon's assassination in December 1980.

In the early 1980s, while still technically billing itself as "Elektra/Asylum Records or Elektra/Asylum/Nonesuch Records", Elektra and Asylum began to break up, with the former becoming more dominant and the latter acting more as an extension. By the middle of the decade, the company was unofficially calling itself Elektra Records, and in 1989 it was renamed Elektra Entertainment. Meanwhile, Asylum splintered into a subsidiary label and subsequently became less active in its own right.
Asylum was reformatted into a country music label, still operated by Elektra, in 1992. Under the new format, Asylum garnered hit recordings from acts like Brother Phelps, Thrasher Shiver, Emmylou Harris, Kevin Sharp, Bryan White, and Lila McCann. They also produced many critically acclaimed albums by artists including Mandy Barnett, Guy Clark, The Cox Family, Bob Woodruff, J.D. Myers and Jamie Hartford. However, by the end of the decade, mismanagement and a lack of money for promotion led to the dissolution of the country label Asylum.

In 2003, Mike Curb, head of Curb Records, revived Asylum's Nashville division, forming a new label known as Asylum-Curb. LeAnn Rimes, Clay Walker, Lee Brice, Rio Grand, Hank Williams, Jr. and Wynonna are among the artists in the Asylum-Curb division.
After being dormant for several years, Asylum Records was revived as an urban music-based label in 2004, independently managed through Warner Music Group. Some of its releases are distributed in conjunction with Warner Bros. Records and others through Atlantic Records. In 2006, WMG switched to Asylum to operate under its newly created Independent Label Group, which also comprises Cordless Recordings and East West Records.
On December 6, 2006, Asylum Records announced the signing of Atlanta-based metal band Sevendust, the first non-hip-hop artist to sign with the newly reconfigured label. Sevendust's Asylum debut (their sixth full-length album overall), titled "Alpha" was released on March 6, 2007, selling around 42,000 albums in its first week. Although Asylum has signed them, they have not given any notice of it anywhere. Sevendust's second album , on the Asylum label was released in 2008.

Grammy Award for Album of the Year

The Grammy Award for Album of the Year is an award category at the Grammy's. 
The Grammy has been awarded since 1959. It was originally awarded only to the artist. It is not given to the artist, the producer, the engineer and/or mixer and mastering engineer. In 1962, the name of the award was expanded to Album of the Year (other than classical) but it returned to the shorter name in 1965. It was not until until 1968, 1999, and 2002 that the award was won by a rock album, a hip hop album, or a country album, respectively.

Taylor Swift is the biggest winner in this category with 4 wins. Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, and Paul Simon are the second biggest winners in this category with 3 wins each. Paul McCartney leads all artists with 9 nominations: 5 as a member of The Beatles, 3 for solo albums, and 1 as a member of Wings. Frank Sinatra leads solo artists with 8 nominations, 7 for solo albums and 1 for a duet album. Paul McCartney and Paul Simon are the artists with the most nominations in most decades, 5 - the 1960's, the 1970's, the 1980's the 1990's and the 2000's, if counting 1960's nominations as part of their respective groups, The Beatles, and Simon & Garfunkel.

Years reflect the year the Grammy Awards were awarded, for music released the previous year.

Many wonder what the difference is between Record of the Year and Album of the Year. Record of the Year is awarded for either a single or an album track. This award goes to the performer, producer, recording engineer, and/or mixer for that song. Album of the Year is awarded for an entire album, with the award being given to the artist, producer, recording engineer, and mastering engineer for that album. So, in this context, "record" means one song and "album" means the entire collection of songs on a CD or LP.

Unlike Record of the Year, which goes to the artist and production team of a single song, Song of the Year goes to the songwriter(s) of the song. Therefore, Record of the Year is awarded to the best "recording".

Grammy Award for Song of the Year

The Grammy Award for Song of the Year is one of the four most prestigious awards in the Grammy Awards ceremony, if not in the entire American music industry. It has been awarded since 1959 to the composer (not the performer) of the song in question. It almost always happens that one or more recordings are nominated for Song of the Year and Record of the Year, and a recording could receive both awards. Years reflect the year the Grammy Awards were presented, for music released the previous year.

Unlike Record of the Year, which goes to the performer and production team of a single song, Song of the Year goes to the song composer(s).
Every year there is a lot of confusion between the Grammy categories Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year. Record of the Year is awarded for either a single or an album track. This award is given to the performing artist and the producer, recording engineer, and/or mixer of that song. Song of the Year is also awarded for a single or individual track, but the recipient of this award is the songwriter who actually created the song in the first place. Album of the Year is awarded for an entire album, with the award being given to the artist, producer, and recording engineer for that album.

Blanchard's cricket frog

Blanchard's cricket frog, the Blanchard cricket frog, Texas coast cricket frog, or coastal cricket frog ("Acris blanchardi") is a frog. It lives in Canada, the United States, and Mexico.

The adult frog is 1.6-3.8 cm long from nose to rear end. The back legs are very long. The skin on the frog's back has bumps on it but the skin on the belly does not. The skin on the frog's back is usually gray or brown in color. Some frogs have a reddish or brown stripe. The frogs have a mark like a triangle between their eyes.

Some of the tadpoles have dark color on the ends of their tails. Scientists think this confuses some animals that want to eat the tadpole. But it only works on some of them. Tadpoles that live in water with dragonfly larvae often have dark tails. Tadpoles that live in streams with fish usually do not.

There are fewer of these frogs than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frogs live, because of chemicals meant to kill pests, chemicals meant to make crops grow, pollution, and climate change.

Scientists used to think this frog was a subspecies of "Acris crepitans", but in 2008, they looked at the frog's DNA. They decided it was really its own species. It is closely related to a "Acris crepitans", though, especially "Acris crepitans paludicola".

They prefer semi-aquatic microhabitats.

Verve Records

Verve Records is an American jazz record label. It is now owned by Universal Music Group. It was founded by Norman Granz in 1956, absorbing the catalogues of his previous labels: Norgran Records and Clef Records (founded 1953) and material that had previously been licensed to Mercury previously.
Verve's catalogue grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s to include most of the major jazz figures, although Granz tended to record established artists, sometimes those on the decline, rather than new talent. It also recognized the potential of comedy albums, producing Spike Jones' first LP, "Dinner Music For People Who Aren't Very Hungry" in 1956 and several best-selling albums featuring live performances by Shelley Berman beginning in 1960. 

Granz sold Verve to MGM in 1961 for $3 million. Creed Taylor was named producer and took a more commercial approach, cancelling several contracts. Taylor brought bossa nova to America with the Stan Getz/Charlie Byrd LP "Jazz Samba" as well as "Getz/Gilberto". Several noted arrangers also worked for the Verve label in the 1960s, including Claus Ogerman and Oliver Nelson. Claus Ogerman, by his own admission in Gene Lees' "Jazzletter", arranged some 60-70 albums for Verve under Creed Taylor's direction between 1963 and 1967.

Shortly before leaving Verve in 1967, Taylor oversaw the creation of a folk music subsidiary named Verve Folkways (later renamed Verve Forecast) by Verve executive Jerry Schoenbaum. But now, new recordings began to slow down and cease entirely in the early 1970s.

Francis William Aston

Francis William Aston (1 September 1877 – 20 November 1945) was a British chemist and physicist who invented the mass spectrometer. He won the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work with isotopes. 

Aston built the first mass spectrometer in 1919. This tool measures the mass-to-charge ratio of particles. By this time, Frederick Soddy had discovered different forms of some radioactive elements. These were called isotopes. However, Soddy could not prove that isotopes had different mass.

Using his mass spectrometer, Aston proved this. He first found that neon had isotopes with different masses. He discovered many isotopes for non-radioactive elements. In total, he discovered 212 isotopes.

Aston developed the whole number rule, which says that the mass of atoms have whole-number ratios to each other.

Aston was a fellow of the Royal Society and Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.

Street performance

Street performance or busking is a type of performance done in public places for money or other gifts. Street performance is done all over the world, and it has been done since ancient times. People who do street performance can be called street performers or buskers.

Street performances can be any type of performance. Some examples of street performances are making music, singing, juggling, dancing, and drawing caricatures. Some street performances can also be weird things, such as sword swallowing and being a living statue.

There are many types of street performances.

"Circle shows" are performances that get people to crowd around them. Most of them have a start and an end, such as street theatre.

"Walk-by acts" are performances where a busker performs in a way that people can easily walk past them. These are mostly musicians and living statues. They do not usually have a start and an end, because the busker will keep performing for as long as they want. Some walk-by acts get people to crowd around them, because the people think the act is good.

"Stoplight performances" are performances where buskers perform when cars are stopped on a road. Because cars do not stop for very long on the road, these buskers have fast performances. These are more common in South America.

Johan de Jong

Johan de Jong (26 March 1941 – 7 December 2022) was a Dutch biologist, barn owl expert and writer.

De Jong dedicated his life to the barn owl. Without his efforts, the barn owl would almost certainly be extinct in the Netherlands. De Jong had a nature section at the Omrop Fryslân radio for over 36 years. He received several awards including the and was inducted into the international "World Owl Hall of Fame".

De Jong was born on a farm in near Drachten. He was the eldest of three children. His father had multiple sclerose, so at young age he helped on the farm. He became a biology teacher at the Drachtster Lyceum. He was a popular teacher and often took the students outside. Next of being a teacher, he did research on barn owls. During the night he observed born owl nests. Later he used a camera with a special lens that he borrowed of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld.

During the 1970s the barn owl was threatened with extinction. There were only about a hundred breeding pairs the Netherlands, and eight in the province of Friesland. De Jong started a rescue plan and founded in 1973 the "Tsjerkûlen Fryslân" working group. Nest boxes were placed in hundreds of barns. The number of volunteers increased and also the number of barn owl increased. In 1985 De Jong became for many years national coordinator. Without the efforts of Johan de Jong, the barn owl would almost certainly be extinct in the Netherlands.

De Jong kept a few barn owls. First in the attic of the Drachtster Lyceum and later at home. The owls had laid eggs in captivity and that had never happened anywhere before. He first talked about it on the radio in 1984. It was the start of a weekly nature section. In addition to radio work and his work for the barn owls, he was also actively involved in the bird shelter "De Fûgelhelling" in Ureterp. His last nature section was in 2021. On his retirement Omrop Fryslân founded a prize the "Johan de Jong tree". The prize is an annual prize for the best nature initiative in Friesland. The winner places the three on a location he can chose.

De Jong wrote four books. His last book was published in the summer of 2017, a reference work about the barn owl.

De Jong received several award. He became knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau, he received the "Gouden Lepelaar" (translated: Golden Spoonbill) and the 1999 . In 2008, he was inducted into the "World Owl Hall of Fame", an international award for his commitment to the barn owl.

After having problems with his health for several years, he was admitted to hospital in December 2022. De Jong died two days later on 7 December 2022, at the age of 81.

History of Interlingua

Interlingua is a constructed language using words that are found in most West-European languages. It was made by IALA - a group of people (the most known was Alexander Gode) who worked on it for more than 20 years, and they finished and published the first dictionary in 1951. Interlingua was created on the base of languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian.

At the beginning of the 20th century, several associations such as the International Research Council, the American Council on Education and the American Council of Learned Societies were investigating the problem of the international auxiliary language.

Alice Vanderbilt Morris and her husband, Dave Hennen Morris had become interested in linguistics and the international auxiliary language movement in the early 1920s. In 1924 they created the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in New York City. They wanted to give scientific support to the study of IALs. They asked for the help of linguists like Edward Sapir, William Edward Collinson, and Otto Jespersen.

In its early years, IALA was focused on three tasks:

To achieve the last goal, it arranged conferences with people that supported those IALs. These people introduced their languages and debated about them. IALA gain the support of different linguists during these conferences and congresses. In 1937, 24 linguists from 19 universities published "Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary". However, the beginning of World War II in 1939 meant the end of those meetings.

Although the IALA did not have the goal of creating its own language, after ten years of research, it concluded that none of the existing artificial languages was good enough. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language.

At that time, supporters of international auxiliary languages were divided in two gropus:

During the war, those who supported a naturalistic auxiliary language won the debate and IALA assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.

E. Clark Stillman with the help of Alexander Gode, developed a technique for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of "control languages". Later, in 1943 Stillman left and Gode became Acting Director of Research. IALA began to develop models of the proposed language, the first of which were presented in Morris's "General Report" in 1945.

In 1946, with the French linguist André Martinet was Director of Research, four models for the language were introduced:

After a survey about those four models, the two more schematic models were rejected and, of the two naturalistic models, M received more support than P. IALA decided to find a middle way between P and M, with some elements of C.

Martinet left the project in 1948, and Gode was in charge of the last phase of Interlingua's development. His task was to combine elements of Model M and Model P; correct the errors pointed out by the surveys with elements of Model C; and develop a vocabulary.

The vocabulary and verb conjugations of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized "" and the 27,000-word Interlingua–English Dictionary (IED). In 1954, IALA published an introductory manual entitled "Interlingua a Prime Vista" ("Interlingua at First Sight").

Vandalic War

The Vandalic War was a war between the Byzantine Empire (or the Eastern Roman Empire) and the Vandals in what is now Tunisia. It was the first of Justinian I's wars of reconquest.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Germanic people have taken over many former Roman territories. The Vandals had taken over Roman Africa. Emperor Justinian wanted to retake control of these lands. In 533, he sent an army from Constantinople. Byzantine commander Belisarius was able to take control of Carthage.

After the Battle of Tricamarum, the Vandals were defeated.

Occupation of Alcatraz

The Occupation of Alcatraz (November 20, 1969 – June 11, 1971) was a protest where 89 Native Americans and other people occupied Alcatraz Island. At one point, the protest had 400 people. It was led by Richard Oakes, LaNada War Jack, and others. The group lived on the island until the United States government made them leave.

The group of protesters named themselves the Indians of All Tribes (IOAT). They said that, because of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (a treaty made between the United States and Lakota tribe), all of the land that was owned by the government that was not being used should be given to Native Americans. Alcatraz stopped being used as a prison in 1963, so many Red Power protestors thought it should be taken by Native Americans.

The Occupation of Alcatraz changed how the United States government made laws about Native Americans for a short time. It was an important Native American protest, and inspired other protests. Richard Oakes was killed in 1972. The American Indian Movement was later targeted by the FBI.

Ahir-Rajput Connection

Several such dynasties, like the kalachuris, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and later the Yadavas, trace their origin to Abhira (pastoralist) clans. 

Some historians believe Yaduvanshi Rajputs are Banjaras or Muslims who started claiming they are Yaduvanshi to increase their Social status.

Mr. Bhattacharya, a distinguished historian, writes in his book the "Indian Castes and Tribes": The Rajputs generally repudiate all connection with the Ahirs, though it seems very probable that the Yaduvanshi Kshatriyas were originally Ahirs. The present Ahirs or Yadavs also repudiate all connection with Rajputs. Accoording to some authors, the Ahirs, Jats Gurjars etc are not Rajputs at all. They are tribes of Kshatriyas. The Rajput word for the ruler has not been used from the time of Ramayana and Mahabharata upto 600 A.D. in the history books or puranas, and after 600 A.D. to 1200 A.D. Rajput is not a word found in books such as Jain Granths.

The main points to remember are that the Kshatriya or Rajput group of castes is essentially an occupational group, composed of all clans following the Hindu ritual who actually undertook the work of government; that consequently, people of most diverse races were and are humped together as Rajputs; and that most of the great clans now in existence are descended either from foreign immigration of the fifth or sixth century of the Christian era, or from indigenous races such as the gonds and bhars.

Historical archaeology

Historical Archaeology is the study of humans in the past that through artifacts, that overlaps with recorded history. Historical archaeologists look at both the material uncovered by archaeologists, as well as historical records in order to make guesses about what happened in the past with the information found. Historical Archaeology is often done by two main groups: professionals and academics.

Historical archaeologists use many of the same methods of study that other archaeologists do, but they often focus on the recent past. Historical archaeology started mostly in the United States in order to study what has happened since the arrival of Europeans. Many of the first historical archaeology projects were done in sites that were related to Colonial America. Since then, historical archaeology has gone on to cover many different areas of study both theoretical and geographical which are covered below.

Common theoretical approaches that historical archaeologists use include:

This theoretical work draws on the works of German philosopher Karl Marx. It is popular in the field because it thinks about the importance of power and class. In historical archaeology this is useful for studying issues such as labor and studies have been done in sites of labor conflict such as Ludlow, Colorado and Mono Mills, California.

Feminist movements made their way into the work of many historical archaeologists by making the research of historical archaeologists more about gender, sexuality, and reproduction. There has also been inclusion of the thought of indigenous peoples to make archaeological theory less colonial. Studies focused on ideas found in Feminism have been done at places such as plantations as well as in colonial San Francisco, and studies using indigenous world views are common throughout the United States.

Historical archaeologists that do these things usually try to get people in the community much more involved in the archaeological projects they are working on and preserving heritage for future generations. This also means preserving buildings and sites that are architecturally and culturally significant.

This type of archaeology is focused on using theory and methods common in historical archaeology to look at artifacts from the last twenty years. This is more common in areas experiencing political, social, or economic problems. Contemporary Archaeology also deals with issues such as abandonment and modern Ruination.

An early example of contemporary archaeology is the Tucson Garbage Project begun in the early 1970s and expanded to other cities. To a large extent, the garbage project is about understanding current use and waste of consumer goods.

Historical archaeology is strongest in North America where it began. In the United States studies that are popular include African diaspora in the American South and Northeast, Asian diaspora in the West, and Colonial America in the Northeast. Historical archaeology has now spread to all other parts of the world but is strongest in North America, Latin America, and other colonized areas.

Fast-food restaurant

A fast-food restaurant is a restaurant that serves fast-food. Usually, these restataurants mostly serve food to take away. Many of them do not have a large seating capacity, and often, seating is not very comfortable. The type of restaurant is also known as quick-service restaurant (QSR). The food choice is limited, and usually prepared in bulk in advance. It is either kept hot, or heated up, before it is served. The kind of food is often of a "meat-sweet diet". Very often, fast-food restaurants are part of a restaurant chain or a franchise. The chain or franchise will provide partly-prepared standardized products or ingredients. 
The term "fast food" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam–Webster in 1951.

Variations on the fast-food restaurant concept include fast-casual restaurants and catering trucks. Fast-casual restaurants have higher sit-in ratios, offering a mix between counter-service typical at fast-food restaurants and a traditional table service restaurant. Catering trucks (also called food trucks) often park just outside worksites and are popular with factory workers.

Sonic hedgehog

The sonic hedgehog protein (SHH) is coded by the "SHH" gene. The protein is named after the character "Sonic the Hedgehog".

This key signalling molecule "regulates embryonic development in all animals". SHH controls organogenesis and the organization of the central nervous system, limbs, digits and many other parts of the body. Sonic hedgehog is a morphogen that patterns the developing embryo using a concentration gradient.

Abnormal activation of SHH signalling in adult tissues causes various types of cancers. General readers might look for a simplified account by an expert author.

William Davenant

Sir William Davenant was an English poet and playwright. There were also rumours about Davenant being a bastard son of William Shakespeare though they have not been proven.

Davenant was born in 1606 and (according to John Aubrey) Shakespeare was his godfather. Shakespeare died in 1616 when Davenant was 10 years old. Two years later, Davenant wrote a poem about remembering Shakespeare but he only published it as an adult. Davenant was taught to become a playwright by Ben Jonson and was known for a play called Madagascar. After Jonson died, King Charles I appointed Davenant as poet laureate. 

When Oliver Cromwell led a rebellion against King Charles, William Davenant fought against Cromwell so Charles gave Davenant a knighthood and called him Sir William Davenant. Davenant also got military supplies from France to England. After Charles was overthrown and his head cut off, Charles’s wife Henrietta Maria ran away to her brother Louis XIII in France and her son and Sir William Davenant came with her. Henrietta Maria appointed Davenant governor of Maryland to give him an excuse to sail to North America and convince people there to fight for them against Cromwell. But on the way there Davenant was captured and brought to England. Cromwell wanted to kill Davenant but Davenant’s friend John Milton asked Cromwell not to do that so Cromwell locked Davenant in the Tower of London. 

Cromwell eventually released Sir William Davenant from the Tower and Davenant found out that Cromwell had banned public performance of plays. So Sir William Davenant turned his own home into a private theatre and since people weren’t writing plays at the time, most of the plays he put on were the ones by William Shakespeare. 

When Charles II became king of England, he was going to kill John Milton for having been a supporter of Oliver Cromwell but Davenant convinced Charles not to do that. Then Charles unbanned plays so Sir William Davenant, who was again poet laureate, started his own theatre. At the time Davenant mostly did Shakespeare plays and a lot of other people ended up doing the same thing. Then Davenant decided to start having female characters be played by actresses instead of by men. Davenant also tried to modernize some Shakespeare plays after plays by other people started to become popular. 

After Davenant died, King Charles II appointed Davenant’s friend John Dryden as poet laureate. 

In his biography of William Shakespeare, John Aubrey said that he got information from Sir William Davenant and his brother because they knew Shakespeare as children. And in his biography of Davenant, Aubrey said that Shakespeare was Davenant’s godfather and that Davenant was said to write with the same spirit as Shakespeare did. Aubrey also wrote that when Davenant was drunk, he told his friend Samuel Butler that he would be happy if people thought he was the actual son of Shakespeare even if led to his mother being called “a whore”. 

There is a lot of debate about if Davenant were actually the son of Shakespeare or not. Some people think he was and some think he wasn’t. 

My Hero (song)

"My Hero" is a song by Foo Fighters, an American rock band. It was released in January 1998. The song is a single from the band's second album, "The Colour and the Shape". The song reached number 6 on "Billboard" Alternative Songs, a music chart.

The band started playing the song at concerts in 1995. On July 17, 1995, Dave Grohl recorded a demo of the song in his house. The demo has Grohl playing every instrument, and did not have all of the lyrics. The band thought that the demo was good. They recorded a better version of it for their second album, "The Colour and the Shape". It was released in 1997. Grohl has said that the song is for normal people who are also heroes.

The song was made with two different drum recordings. For the song, they are played at the same time. Because there are two drum recordings, the band uses a simpler drum beat when they play the song at concerts.

Many people think that "My Hero" is one of the best songs made by the band. In 2020, "Kerrang!" made a list of the twenty best Foo Fighters songs. "My Hero" was seventh. In 2021, "American Songwriter" said it was the best song by the band.

Camel wrestling

Camel wrestling () is a sport that is common in the Aegean Sea region of Turkey. In the sport, two male Tülü camels wrestle each other. This is normally caused by a female camel in heat being put where they can see her. The sport is also held in other parts of the Middle East and South Asia.

A Tülü is a hybrid of Bactrian camel and dromedary. Camel wrestling in Turkey is hold by the Yörüks.

Camel fighting was started by ancient Turkic tribes over 1000 years ago. Camels also wrestle in the wild. This has been happening since before nomads began doing it. In the 1920s, the Turkish National Aviation league had held camel fights to get money to buy airplanes for the Turkish government. The government tried to stop them from doing this in the 1920s. They said that it as too backwards of a practice. In the 1980s, the new government of Turkey began supporting it as part of the historic culture of Turkey.
Because of the need of a nearby female camel, the events are normally held during mating season. The camels use their necks to try to make the other camel fall down. A camel wins if the other camel falls to the ground or runs from the fight. Most fighting camels are bred in either Iran or Afghanistan. A good fighting camel can be sold for over $20,000.

The events can be dangerous to the people watching them if the camels try to run away through the crowd.

There are about thirty festivals in Aegean Turkey each year. They take place from November to March. Events always take place on Sundays in football stadiums. At the end of the season, a tournament is held in which the best camels compete. Many tourists go to the events. They are a large part of tourist industry in Western Anatolia.

Several animal rights organizations say that camel wresting is cruelty to animals.

Restoration literature

Restoration literature is the English books written during the historical period commonly referred to as the English Restoration (1660–1689). This time matches up to the last years of Stuart rule in England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.

In general, the word is used to represent almost the same styles of literature that centre on a celebration of or reaction to the restored court of Charles II.

The Restoration was an age of poetry. This genre was the most important form of literature at that time.

Prose in the Restoration period is ruled-over by Christian religious writing. However, in later periods two other genres would be more important: fiction and journalism.


Augustan literature

Augustan literature refers to the books belonging to the British literature that were written during the rules of Queen Anne, King George I, and George II. This happened between the first half of the 18th century and the 1740s.

During this time, there was a fast development of the novel and the satire, the change of drama from political satire into melodrama and an evolution toward poetry of personal exploration.

In philosophy, it was an age ruled by empiricism, while in the writings of political economy, it marked the evolution of mercantilism as a formal philosophy, the development of capitalism and the victory of trade.

Romantic literature in English

Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that started in Europe toward the end of the 18th century. 

The beginning of this period is usually located in 1798, with the publication of William Wordsworth's and Samuel Coleridge's "Lyrical Ballads". The crowning of Queen Victoria in 1837 is accepted as its end. 

Romanticism arrived in other parts of the English-speaking world later. For example, it arrived around 1820 to the United States.

Hippiatrica

The Hippiatrica (Greek: Ἱππιατρικά) is a Byzantine compilation of ancient Greek writings, or texts, focused on the care and healing of horses. The texts were probably compiled in the 5th or 6th century AD by an unknown editor.

The writings of seven authors from Late Antiquity make up the main parts of the "Hippiatrica": 1) the veterinary manuals of Apsyrtus, 2) Eumelus (a veterinarian in Thebes, Greece), 3) Hierocles, 4) Hippocrates, 5) Theomnestus, 6) Pelagonius's Latin text translated into Greek, and 7) the chapter on horses from Anatolius's text on agriculture. The seven authors allude to the classical Greek veterinarians Xenophon and Simon of Athens. They were also influenced by Hellenistic agricultural literature based on Mago of Carthage. In the 10th century AD, two more writings from Late Antiquity were added to the "Hippiatrica": a work by Tiberius and an anonymous set of "Prognoses and Remedies" (Greek: Προγνώσεις καὶ ἰάσεις). The contents of the "Hippiatrica" focus on practical treatment rather than on medical theory. Also, the texts in the "Hippiatrica" come in different styles: proverbs, poetry, incantations, letters, instructions, prooimia, medical definitions, recipes, and reminiscences. Cheiron, the Greek centaur connected to healing and veterinary medicine, appears twice in the "Hippiatrica" and a cure called a "cheironeion" (Greek: χειρώνειον) is named after the mythological creature.


Victorian literature

Victorian literature are the books written and published during the rule of Queen Victoria (1837–1901). The 19th century is believed by some to be the Golden Age of English Literature (that is, the best age in the history of English literature), especially for British novels. It was in the Victorian era that the novel became the leading literary genre in English. 

The changes that happened in English life during this time are reflected in the writings from this time. Famous book writers from this period include Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dickens (the most famous Victorian novelist), William Thackeray, the three Brontë sisters, George Eliot, and Thomas Hardy.

Give It Up

"Give It Up" is a song by the "Victorious" cast featuring American actress and singers Elizabeth Gillies and Ariana Grande from the soundtrack album "Victorious: Music from the Hit TV Show" (2011).

American actresses and singers Ariana Grande and Elizabeth Gillies started singing on a TV show called "Victorious" and their first song was "Give It Up". "Give It Up" was played for the first time "Victorious" during a one-hour special episode called "Freak the Freak Out" on November 26, 2010. In the episode, Tori Vega (played by Victoria Justice) and her friends were happy to go to a fake karaoke club called Karaoke Dokie, where there are singing contests every week. During a singing contest, Jade West (played by Gillies) and Cat Valentine (played by Grande) performed "Give It Up" together. However, the owner of the karaoke club changed the rules of the contest so that his daughter and her friend could win instead.

"Give It Up" was officially released on August 2, 2011, as the seventh track on the soundtrack album called "Victorious: Music from the Hit TV Show". The music style of "Give It Up" is a mix of teen pop, pop, and R&B. Kristen S. Hé, who wrote for "Billboard" magazine, said that in "Give It Up," Grande sang with a different and deeper voice compared to her other songs. Bob Hoose and Steven Isaac, writing for Plugged In, compared "Give It Up" to a song called "Lady Marmalade" by Patti LaBelle, which was released in 1974. In the song, Grande and Gillies tell a boy to "come a little closer": "At the end of the night/It's the same old story/But you never get it right/Give it up/Take a backseat, boy/'Cause now I’m driving."

According to Xandra Harbet from "Looper" and Delilah Gray from "The List", "Give It Up" is a very popular song for fans of "Victorious". A person from "Entertainment Weekly" named Marcus Jones said that "Give It Up" is a very famous song that people like to sing when doing karaoke. Hé made a list of all the songs by Ariana Grande and put "Give It Up" at number 104. She said the song was similar to the music of Christina Aguilera and has aged well over time. She also believed that Gillies did the best singing in the song. Justin Curto from "Vulture" made a list of all 54 collaborations of Grande and placed "Give It Up" in third place. He said that the song keeps getting better even when you don't think it can get any better. Megan Gaertner from "Her Campus" put "Give It Up" at number seven on her list. She said the song was a girl-power song with strong singing and is great to listen to if girls want to ignore boys. Sam Margolis also from "Her Campus" put "Give It Up" at number one on her list of the best songs from "Victorious". She said that Grande and Gillies showed what real talent is. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic did not like the song very much. He said that "Give It Up" sounds like a song that Britney Spears didn't want to use.

Grande continued her Sweetener World Tour after she had to skip a concert because she was sick. On November 19, 2019, Grande posted a message on Twitter saying that she was working on something special, saying, "Guys I can't tell u why yet, but I'm so excited for tonight. I've never felt this way. Goodbye." Later that night, at a concert in Atlanta, Georgia, Grande surprised her fans by having Gillies on stage to perform "Give It Up" live. Grande also asked Matt Bennett, the actor who played Robbie in "Victorious", to sing "I Think You're Swell" during the concert. "Give It Up" was also played in the background on two episodes of the TV show "iCarly".

Benzonatate (sold with other names, such as Tessalon) is a medicine used to help with coughing and hiccups. It is taken by mouth. People under ten years old should not use it. It starts working after around twenty minutes, and can last eight hours.

It can cause side effects such as being tired or dizzy, having stomach aches, or having hallucinations. It can also cause allergic reactions. Having too much benzonatate can cause seizures, heartbeats that are not normal, or even death. Chewing benzonatate capsules instead of just swallowing them can cause spasms in the lungs and shock. It is not known if people who are pregnant or breastfeeding can use the drug. It works by numbing some nerves in the lungs.

Benzonatate was allowed to be used as a medicine in the United States in 1958. In 2020, there were over 3 million prescriptions for the drug.

Mark Nicholson

Magnus Douglas "Mark" Nicholson (6 March 1871 - 3 July 1941 in Oswestry, Shropshire, England) was an English football player and coach of the late 19th century and one of the most important pioneers of football in Austria at the beginning of the 20th century. He played as defender.
Mark Nicholson began his career in April 1889 at the age of 18 as a player for Oswestry Town. In May 1891 he signed a professional contract with West Bromwich Albion. He played his first league game against Everton in September 1891 . He made 67 appearances for the club. The highpoint as player was the win of the FA Cup on 19 March 1892 with a 3-0 win over Aston Villa. He left to take a job as deputy headmaster at a school in Bedford and continued his career at nearby Luton Town.
1897 he came to Vienna and played for First Vienna FC. Not only was he by far the best footballer in Vienna at the time and, as an absolute star, his club's box office magnet. He soon took over agendas as an organizer and functionary at the club. In the following years that followed, he not only reformed the training and game design of Vienna, he also campaigned for the organization of the entire football game in Austria. In 1898, Nicholson organized the "Comité zur Veranstaltung von Fußball-Wettspielen" ( Soccer Competitions Committee). One of the first activities of this committee was organizing two matches of the Oxford University football team in 1899.

On 4 January 1900, this committee formed the "Austrian Football Union". Nicholson was the first president. The Union dissolved in 1904 due to its powerlessness compared to the clubs, especially First Vienna and the Vienna Cricketers. These clubs founded the Österreichischen Fußballverband (Austrian Football Association) thepredecessor of today's ÖFB.

In the last game for Vienna, a friendly against FC Zurich, Nicholson even kept the goal. When Nicholson left Vienna he retired as an Austrian football pioneer and the first honorary captain of the Vienna for life. Nicholson was no longer active as a football player after his time in Vienna, but he did as a referee in Hamburg and later as a cricketer in Paris.

In 1914 a Viennese football club was founded in the club colors blue and yellow with the name SC Nicholson which became FC Wien in 1933.

The Age of Reason

The Age of Reason; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology is a book written by English and American political activist Thomas Paine. It defends the philosophical position of deism. It follows in the tradition of 18th-century British deism, and challenges the official religion and the authority of the Bible. It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807. 

It was a best-seller in the United States, where it was the cause for a coming back of deism. However, it was not well received in Britain, because the public feared increased political radicalism as a result of the French Revolution.

"The Age of Reason" presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the Christian Church. Paine preferes reason in the place of revelation, leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as an ordinary book, rather than a text given by God. In "The Age of Reason", he promotes natural religion and argues for the existence of a creator god.

Italian literature

Italian literature is written in the Italian language, especially in Italy. It may also refer to literature written by Italians or in other languages spoken in Italy, often languages that are very similar to modern Italian, including regional varieties and dialects. Italian literature begins in the 12th century, when in different areas of the peninsula the Italian vernacular started to be used to write books. The "Ritmo laurenziano" is the first text of Italian literature.

One of the first examples of Italian literature is the tradition of lyric poetry sung in Occitan. This tradition arrived in Italy by the end of the 12th century. In 1230, the Sicilian School became famous for being the first style in standard Italian. Dante Alighieri, one of the greatest of Italian poets, is important and famous for being the author of "La Divina Commedia" ("The Divine Comedy", c. 1308–1320).

Renaissance humanism developed during the 14th and the beginning of the 15th centuries. Early Italian humanists, such as the lyric poet Francesco Petrarca and the Neoplatonist philosopher Marsilio Ficino, were highly educated Classical scholars and great collectors of old manuscripts. 

The development of the drama in the 15th century was very great. In the 16th century, the main feature of the time following the end of the Renaissance is that it perfected the Italian character of its language. Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini were the chief originators of the science of history. Pietro Bembo was an famous and important figure in the development of the Italian language and an influence on the 16th-century renewed interest in the works of Petrarca.

In 1690, the Academy of Arcadia was created with the goal of "restoring" literature by copying the simplicity of the old shepherds. In the 18th century, the political condition of the Italian states began to improve, and philosophers spread their writings and ideas throughout Europe during the Age of Enlightenment. Apostolo Zeno and Metastasio are two of the important figures of the age. Carlo Goldoni, a Venetian playwright and librettist, created the comedy of character. The leading figure of the 18th-century Italian literary revival was Giuseppe Parini.

The ideas behind the French Revolution of 1789 gave a special direction to Italian literature in the second half of the 18th century. It began with the publication of the book "Dei delitti e delle pene" ("On Crimes and Punishments", 1764) by Cesare Beccaria. Patriotism and classicism were the two ways of thinking that motivated the literature that began with the Italian playwright and poet Vittorio Alfieri. Others include the poets Vincenzo Monti and Ugo Foscolo.

The Romantic movement had as its organ the "Conciliatore", established in 1818 at Milan. The main initiator of the reform was the Italian poet and author Alessandro Manzoni, known for his historical novel "I promessi sposi" ("The Betrothed", 1827–1842). The great Italian poet of the age was Giacomo Leopardi. The bookish movement that happened before and at the same time as the political revolutions of 1848 was represented by four writers: Giuseppe Giusti, Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, Vincenzo Gioberti, and Cesare Balbo. After the "Risorgimento", political literature became less important. During the first part of this period, two different tendencies of literature against Romanticism appeared: the "Scapigliatura" and "Verismo". The most well-known figure of Verismo was the Sicilian writer Giovanni Verga, author of "I Malavoglia" ("The House by the Medlar-Tree", 1881).

Important early 20th-century Italian writers include Giovanni Pascoli, Italo Svevo, Gabriele D'Annunzio, Umberto Saba, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Eugenio Montale, and Luigi Pirandello (winner of the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature). Neorealism was developed by Alberto Moravia. Umberto Eco became successful with the detective story "Il nome della rosa" ("The Name of the Rose", 1980). 
Six Italian authors have received the Nobel Prize in Literature. These are Giosuè Carducci, Grazia Deledda, Luigi Pirandello, Salvatore Quasimodo, Eugenio Montale, and Dario Fo.

The founders own a combined 95% of voting shares. 

It was founded by Evan Spiegel.

On March 2, 2017 Snap Inc. was listed on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $17 per share.

At the start of trading, the company's valuation reached about $33 billion. It was the largest offering by a US tech company since Facebook's IPO.

In June, Snap acquired map location-sharing service Zenly for $250 million to $350 million.

Mundeze

Mundeze is a constructed auxiliary language. Its creator is Djuna de Lannoy, a Spanish who lives in Belgium. He created the language to make international communication easier. The language was published in 2012.

Each word in Mundeze comes from a smaller word called a "root word". A root word has a root and an ending. 

Here are some of the endings:


To indicate the aspect, there are three adverbs, which are added before the verb:


Warm Ways

"Warm Ways" is a 1975 song by British American band Fleetwood Mac and is the lead single from their 10th studio album "Fleetwood Mac". It was not released as a single in the United States and did not chart in the United Kingdom.

All Shook Up

"All Shook Up" is a 1957 song by Elvis Presley and went to number 1 in the United States for 8 weeks and number 1 in the United Kingdom. It went on to be covered by Suzi Quatro and Billy Joel for the 1992 movie "Honeymoon in Vegas".

AC adapter

An AC adapter (hereafter called adapter) is a type of external power supply. It is often in a small case similar to the end of an electrical extension cord that plugs into an electrical wall outlet. Charger and power adapter are more common names.

Adapters are used with electrical devices that need the voltage and power changed from the power available at the wall outlet. They are used to power electronic devices with or without batteries. By 2022, they frequently could both power a device and charge its battery at the same time through the same connection point. Some adapters with a limited voltage and cycle range can only be used in one country, but many newer ones can be used in most countries. Using devices that require adapters increases safety since the wall outlet power is transformed to a lower safer voltage.  Many adapters connect to the device by a small electrical cord with a USB-C connector at the adapter end and a connector that matches the device at the other.

Portuguese literature

Portuguese literature is the literature written in the Portuguese language, particularly by citizens of Portugal; it may also refer to literature written by people living in Portugal, Brazil, Angola and Mozambique, and other Portuguese speaking countries.
An early example of Portuguese literature is the tradition of a medieval Galician-Portuguese poetry. This tradition developed in Galicia and northern Portugal. 

The literature of Portugal is told apart by several aspects:
The seventeenth century is generally seen as the century of literary decadence, despite the existence of writers like Father António Vieira, Padre Manuel Bernardes and Francisco Rodrigues Lobo.

The writers of the eighteenth century tried to oppose a certain decadence of the baroque stage by making an effort to recover the level of quality reached during the Golden Age. This was done through the creation of academies and literary Arcadias - it was the time of Neoclassicism. In the nineteenth century, the neoclassical ideals were abandoned, where Almeida Garrett introduced Romanticism, followed by Alexandre Herculano and Camilo Castelo Branco.

In the second half of the nineteenth century, Realism (of naturalistic features) developed in novel-writing, whose exponents included Eça de Queiroz and Ramalho Ortigão. Literary trends during the twentieth century are represented mainly by Fernando Pessoa, believed one of the greatest national poets together with Camões. In later years, we can see the development of prose fiction, thanks to authors such as António Lobo Antunes and José Saramago, winner of the Nobel prize for Literature.

Kithara

The kithara or cithara ( ) was an ancient Greek musical instrument. It was a kind of lyre with seven strings. The lyre was used for teaching music to beginners, but the cithara was used by expert musicians called "kitharodes". The word "guitar" comes from the Greek word "kithara".

The cithara's origins are from Minoan-Mycenaean lyres shaped like swan-necks. Some scholars have connected the cithara with string instruments from ancient Anatolia.

The lyre was used as a teaching tool in schools, but the cithara was an instrument needing a great amount of skill. The cithara was played mainly with dances, epic recitations, rhapsodies, odes, and lyric songs. It was also played solo at receptions, banquets, national games, and trials of skill. Aristotle said that these stringed instruments were not for educational purposes but for pleasure only. It was played by strumming the strings with a stiff plectrum made of dried leather, held in the right hand with the elbow outstretched and handpalm bent inwards.

Most paintings on vases show citharas with seven strings but sometimes a very skillful kitharode is shown playing a kithara with more than the traditional seven strings.

The cithara had a deep, wooden box made of two resonating tables, either flat or slightly arched, connected by ribs or sides of equal width. At the top, its strings were knotted around the crossbar or yoke ("zugon") or to rings threaded over the bar, or wound around pegs. The other ends of the strings were secured to a tail-piece after passing over a flat bridge, or the tail-piece and bridge were combined.

The cithara is said to have been invented by Apollo, the god of music. Apollo is often depicted playing a cithara instead of a lyre, often dressed in a kitharode’s formal robes. "Kitharoidos", or "Citharoedus", is an epithet given to Apollo, which means "lyre-singer" or "one who sings to the lyre".

An "Apollo Citharoedus" or "Apollo Citharede", is the word for a kind of statue or other image of Apollo with a cithara. Among the best-known examples is the Apollo Citharoedus, a large 2nd-century CE marble statue made by an unknown Roman sculptor that is now located in the museums of the Vatican.

Sappho is closely connected to music including string instruments like the cithara and the barbitos. She was an important woman in Greek society and made popular songs that focused on emotions. A story from Greek myth goes that she went up the slopes of Mount Parnassus where she was welcomed by the Muses. She wandered through the laurel grove and came upon the cave of Apollo. There, she bathed in the Castalian Spring and took Phoebus' (Apollo's) plectrum to play skillful music. The sacred nymphs danced while she stroked the strings with much talent to bring forth sweet melodies from the cithara. 

According to the "Suda", Phrynis () of Lesbos was the first to play the cithara in Athens and won at the Panathenaea.

Alloparenting is when people other than a child’s mother and father help to raise them. Alloparent is derived from the Greek words 'allo' and 'parens.' Allo means "other," and parens means "parents." So alloparents mean other parents. Other caregivers may include family members or people in the community who are not related to the child. In humans, alloparenting is a common practice to help raise children. The people that take care of the children are called their alloparents.

Humans have a very long infancy and childhood compared to other species. They depend on the adults around them. Adults need to provide children with shelter, food, water, education, love, and support. Children need people to take care of them for many years until they are older. Parents also pass down culture to their children and teach them all about life. They teach them traditions and how to act in the community. They rely on other people as they grow and learn new things. When the birth parents are not the regular caregivers, alloparents take over this role.

Cirkus

Cirkus is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language period comedy drama film. It is directed and produced by Rohit Shetty. The movie is also jointly produced by Rohit Shetty Productionz and T-Series.

"Cirkus" is a remake of the 1982 Hindi film "Angoor" which itself was based on William Shakespeare's play "The Comedy of Errors". Principal photography for the film began in November 2020 at Mumbai and also took place in Ooty.

The film was theatrically released on 23 December 2022. Panned by critics, the film underperformed at the box office and went on to become one of the biggest commercial failures of 2022.

In 1944, Dr. Roy Jamnadas (Murali Sharma), who is working on the theory of nature vs nurture, separates two sets of identical twins he finds at the doorstep of the orphanage he runs and gives them up for adoption to two different families, based in two different cities. One pair is given to a couple in Ooty and the other pair to a couple in Bangalore, and both the couples name them Roy and Joy. Roy 1 (Ranveer Singh) and Joy 1 (Varun Sharma)'s father runs a circus and after his death, they both take up the responsibility of running the circus. Roy 2 and Joy 2's father is a wealthy industrialist. Roy 1 has a strange connection with electricity and electric currents do not affect him. He uses this ability to show tricks at the circus and becomes famously known as 'Electric Man'. Elsewhere, Roy 2 receives electric shocks whenever Roy 1 comes into contact with electricity.

The story then moves forward 30 years. Roy 1's wife, Mala (Pooja Hegde), cannot conceive and wishes to adopt a child from the Jamnadas Orphanage, but Roy 1 is against the idea. Roy 2 is in love with Bindu but her father Rai Bahadur is skeptical about him as he had seen Roy 1 with Mala in Ooty and had mistaken him for Roy 2, thinking that he is cheating on Bindu. Roy 2 and Joy 2 come to Ooty to buy a tea estate and there is a lot of confusion and misunderstanding as people mistake them for the other pair of twins. Three robbers - Momo, Mango, and Chikki are after them to rob their money. They back off when Roy 2 gives them electric shocks and their boss, Polson Dada later comes to take revenge. They also come across Nagmani, the shady cab driver, and Bagheera, the dacoit turned hotel owner. Roy 2 thinks they are all part of a huge criminal gang that wants to rob them, and when they come across Mala, they think that she is the gang's leader.

Roy 1 decides to gift a diamond necklace to Mala but the jeweler mistakenly gives it to Roy 2, creating further confusion. Moreover, Bindu's father is now convinced that Roy 2 is married to Mala. On hearing this, Bindu threatens to end her relationship with him, not knowing that Mala is actually Roy 1's wife. All the confusion is cleared when both the pairs of twins come face to face at the circus and Dr. Jamnadas reveals the truth to them and his real intention behind separating them. They all reconcile and Roy 1 and Mala finally adopt a child from the orphanage and Roy 2 and Bindu plan to get married soon.

Later, five orphan boys - Gopal, Laxman 1, Madhav, Laxman 2, and Lucky come to stay at the orphanage, hinting at the events before Golmaal Again.


Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary Art

Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary Art was a landmark exhibition held at New York’s Whitney Museum of American Art from November 10, 1994 until March 5, 1995. Organized by curator Thelma Golden, "Black Male" was a survey of the changing representations of black masculinity in contemporary art from the 1970s to the 1990s. The show included almost seventy works by twenty-nine artists of varying race, gender, and ethnicity. It also featured an extensive film and video program that explored representations of blackness in Hollywood, the independent cinema, video, and television. "Black Male" was widely labelled controversial and heavily criticized for its political subject matter, to which Golden responded, "There was no way to speak about the image of the black male in an art exhibition without speaking about what was going on politically and culturally. Many people saw this as either a beginning, in a hopeful way, or an end ... To embrace change and to embrace the new, for some, means giving something up, something being taken." 

"Black Male" featured works that varied in their methods of engagement with stereotypes and falsities of black masculinity that have saturated popular culture for centuries. By placing the works of diverse artists in conversation with each other, Golden sought to emphasize the ways in which American culture has been profoundly enriched and transformed by the voices of African-American art and culture—voices that have long been unnecessarily silenced, ignored, and constrained by stereotypes. The exhibition illustrated the tradition of stereotype and caricature visible in the production of mass culture that has characterized the representation of the black male in modern times. Art historian Huey Copeland stated that the exhibition was not about offering a mirror or image of black masculinity, but providing a context to comprehend how a black male might be produced visually, and the many ways that one might work through that visual production.

According to Golden, the impetus for the exhibition was the goal of creating a new model for understanding the complex aesthetics and politics at work in representations of African American men in the post-Civil Rights era. In her time as a curator at the Whitney Museum, Golden was struck by institutional attitudes and exhibition making that excluded—or only very narrowly included—the work of black artists. The curator described feeling as if "a new language had to be invented" in order to interrogate the idea of cultural specificity in the museum, especially in relation to blackness. One of the central guiding questions for the exhibition, according to Golden, was "what would happen if I made an exhibition that completely lived in a world of Black—with a big B—art and artists: uncompromised, unapologetic, uninterested in the mainstream art world?" She drew from Lowery Stokes Sims' idea of “curatorial archaeology” --- curatorial representation of artists historically excluded from mainstream art exhibitions --- to establish a precedent for thinking about black artists and their work through a conceptual lens, and offer a path to canon revision.

On December 12, 2014, the Education department at the Whitney Museum presented "Looking Back at Black Male", a public program to mark the twentieth anniversary of the exhibition. The event featured Golden in conversation with writer Hilton Als, who edited the exhibition catalogue, and Huey Copeland, art historian and critic, to discuss the exhibition and its impact on the contemporary art scene.

The exhibition features work across a variety of mediums, including photography, sculpture, drawing, painting, and video art. Among the works in the exhibition were:


Exhibited artists included:


"Black Male" was met with mixed, predominantly negative reviews. The most direct criticism came from New York Times reviewer Michael Kimmelman, who wrote, "The result? 'Black Male' will almost certainly be remembered for the debates it provokes, which may be considerable and important. The Whitney is proud of the breadth of issues it tackles, and not altogether wrongly so. It's paradoxical, then, that with 'Black Male,' it succumbs to such chic and narrow thinking."

The exhibition traveled to the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles after its opening show at the Whitney. The exhibition at the Hammer Museum included a comment book in which visitors could express their responses to the show; a total of five spiral-bound notebooks were filled during the run of the exhibition. The responses in the comment book illustrate a wide range of responses to the show, among them:

Treaty of Wallingford

The Treaty of Wallingford, also known as the Treaty of Winchester or the Treaty of Westminster, was an agreement reached in England in the summer of 1153. It was agreed at Wallingford Castle. 


Commodity fetishism

Commodity fetishism is an important concept in Marx's philosophy. In his writings, he thinks that people in capitalist systems are too focused on the end product people buy (a commodity) and forget to think about the processes that helped the commodity come about. 
For example, a ballpoint pen must go through material sourcing, designing, prototyping and manufacturing before it can be shipped and delivered to customers. Many people, including workers, took part in the production of the pen, and Marx believes that capitalist thinking takes people away from those processes and relationships which result in a commodity.

Eslanda Goode Robeson

Eslanda Goode Robeson (1896 - 1965), born December 15, 1896, was an American author, anthropologist and activist. She is best known as a critic of the United State’s racial laws, a supporter of African independence from colonial powers, and as the wife of Paul Robeson. Eslanda Goode Robeson had a large impact on the Civil Rights Movement where she fought segregation and racism in the United States. She continued this work until her death in 1965.

Eslanda Goode Robeson was born in 1896 in Washington, D.C. Her father was a clerk, and her mother was a beautician. Robeson attended the University of Illinois before transferring to Columbia University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1923. 

In 1921 she married a law student named Paul Robeson, who would go on to become a very famous singer, actor, and political activist. Their son, Paul Jr., was born in 1927. 

The Robeson’s moved to London in 1928 for Paul Sr.’s career as a performer. While living in London, Robeson became interested in the history and culture of the African diaspora, and she eventually began her graduate studies in anthropology at the London School of Economics. She studied social anthropology and African cultures under the well-known anthropologist, Bronislaw Malinowski.

Robeson started her career as the first African American hired at New York City's Presbyterian Hospital in the surgical pathology department She then left this career after marrying her husband, Paul.

Eslanda Goode Robeson was also in filmmaking, mostly as an actress. She acted in the silent films "Borderline" (1930) and "Big Fella" (1937).

Over the course of her life, Robeson wrote three books: "Paul Robeson, Negro" (1930), a biography of her husband, "African Journey" (1945), an ethnographic work on sub-Saharan Africa in the 1930’s, and "American Argument" (1949), a wide-ranging conversation between herself and the author, Pearl S. Buck.

Robeson’s most well known book, and most significant contribution to the field of anthropology, was "African Journey", published in 1945.  

"African Journey" is the account of a trip she took to sub-Saharan Africa in 1936 with her then nine-year-old son. Robeson wrote of her experiences with a wide variety of people in southern and eastern Africa; miners, farmers, tribal people, herdswomen, doctors, white colonial officials. She also detailed the roles of women and gender in each culture.

The book is not written in a traditional academic style, but in an easy-to-read way that would give it a wide audience outside of academia. Her goal in writing the book was to challenge the negative views of Africa and Africans that were widely held in the United States by both White and Black Americans, partly because of how they were portrayed in the media.

During her trip, Robeson spent much of her time in countries which were European colonies. It was important for her to show, through her writing, the negative impact that colonial rule was having on the communities she visited. Throughout "African Journey," she connects the daily lives and struggles of Black Africans with those of Black Americans.

Robeson wanted to show her readers that African people were not “primitive,” but as much a part of the modern world as they were and held jobs that would be familiar to anyone in the United States (train engineer, teacher, hotel manager, bank clerk). One way she did this was with photography. "African Journey" includes over 60 photographs (taken by Robeson) showing everyday scenes of Africans working, going to school, and spending time with family. She carefully selected photographs that would look familiar to her Western audience.

"African Journey" was bound to be noticed because of her husband’s fame, but it was well received by critics across racial lines and was selected by the American Library Association as one of the fifty outstanding books of 1945.

The publication became famous to the public and was one of the first books to show a positive view of African people. Because of her publication many African Americans were able to relate to individuals in Africa.

Respect for Marriage Act

The Respect for Marriage Act is a federal law in the United States. It requires all states and territories of the United States to accept marriage between people of the same sex or different races. It was passed by Congress on December 8, 2022, and became law on December 13, 2022.

Until 1967, each U.S. state could choose if they wanted to allow people of different races to marry, or not. That year, the Supreme Court heard a case called Loving v. Virginia. They decided that the U.S. Constitution requires people to be free to marry someone of any race. Laws against interracial marriage could not be enforced any more.

Until 2015, each U.S. state could choose if they wanted to allow same-sex marriage or not. That year, the Supreme Court heard a case called Obergefell v. Hodges. They ruled that same-sex marriage was a fundamental or basic right under the Constitution, so it must be legal everywhere in the United States. Of the nine judges on the Supreme Court, five agreed, and four did not.

On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court heard a case called Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. They ruled that abortion was not a fundamental right under the Constitution. This allowed states to ban abortion. It reversed another court case from 1973, Roe v. Wade which said that abortion was a fundamental right. Six judges agreed with the decision in Dobbs, and three did not. Clarence Thomas was one of the judges who agreed. He wrote that, just as abortion was not protected, same-sex marriage may not be protected. Some people thought the same argument could be used against interracial marriage.

The first version of the law was introduced to the House of Representatives in 2009, but this bill did not pass. It was introduced to Congress again in July 2022. On July 19, it was approved by the House (267–157). All Democrats, and 47 Republicans voted to pass the bill. On November 29, the bill was approved by the Senate (61–36) but with some changes. All Democrats and 12 Republicans voted to pass it. On December 8, 2022, the House approved the new version of the bill (258–169–1). All Democrats and 39 Republicans voted for it. On December 13, President Joe Biden signed the bill, making it law.

The law officially repealed, or canceled, the Defense of Marriage Act. It says that if people are married anywhere in the United States, no state can refuse to accept their marriage based on race, ethnic group, or sex. It does not require religious groups, such as churches, to be involved in any marriage ceremony.

In September 2022, a poll showed that 74% of Americans thought same-sex marriage should be protected, 13% did not, and 13% were uncertain. A poll from 2021 showed that 94% of American supported interracial marriage.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (or Mormon church) supported the law, although they think same-sex relationships are wrong. The Southern Baptist Convention and U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposed it. The Episcopal Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Union for Reform Judaism, United Church of Christ, and Presbyterian Church (USA) supported it.


Don't ask, don't tell

Don't ask, don't tell was a rule of the United States Military. It said that openly homosexual or bisexual people could not serve in the military. Gay, lesbian, or bisexual people could only serve in their military if they did not tell anyone their sexual orientation. This is sometimes called being "in the closet". Officers were not allowed to ask military members if they were gay. They were also not allowed to discriminate against people who thought they were gay. However, people could be discharged, or sent out of the military, for having sex with a person of the same sex.

The rule became official in 1993, after President Bill Clinton signed it. It was repealed, or canceled, in 2011, by President Barack Obama. Since 2011, people who are openly homosexual and bisexual can serve in the military.

Cornufer vitiensis

The Levuka wrinkled ground frog or Fiji ground frog ("Cornufer vitiensis") is a frog. It lives in some of the Fiji Islands. Scientists have seen it between 50 and 800 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 32-45 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 47-60 mm. It has disks on its toes for climbing but the ones on its front feet are much larger than the ones on its back feet. The skin on the frog's back can be any of many different colors: gray, orange, yellow, gray-green but never green. Some have a white or yellow stripe on their backs.

This frog can swim and jump very well. When this frog jumps, it twists in the air. This way, when it hits the ground, it can jump again in a different direction. It does this to jump away from animals that want to eat it.

The female frog lays 20-40 eggs at one time. She lays them on plants. The eggs hatch into frogs. They are never tadpoles.

Unlike most frog species, the female and male frogs both sing. However, the female frog sounds different because she has no vocal sac and the male frog does have one.

There are fewer of these frogs than there were. This is mostly because human beings cut down the trees and forests where the frog lives. Snakes, mongooses, and other animals also catch and eat this frog.

It has singleplayer and co-op modes, and the landscapes and water in the game are designed to look realistic. The game was released in 2013 and has received mostly positive reviews. However, some people have said that it is too hard for new players and doesn't have enough singleplayer content. The game has continued to be updated and expanded by its developer and has a large playerbase and a community of people who create custom content for the game.

Arma 3 is set in a realistic world. It has a variety of weapons that are very accurate and deadly, and players need to be careful when using them because they can kill in just a few shots. The game is set on large maps with realistic land and water environments. Players can take part in different types of missions, such as infiltration and reconnaissance, or commanding large military operations. The game has a lot of different vehicles that players can use, including boats and planes. It also has a feature called diving, which allows players to go underwater and use special equipment and weapons. Players can choose their own approach to completing missions and can use different resources, such as drones, to help them. There are over 50 unique weapons in the game, including assault rifles, machine guns, and rocket launchers. Players can customize their equipment and clothing, and they need to be careful about how much they carry because it can affect their movement and stamina. The game has a multiplayer mode where players can join servers and play with or against each other in different modes, such as player vs player or player vs environment.

In Arma 3, the plot is set in the near future of the 2030s and takes place on the fictional island nation of the Republic of Altis and Stratis. The main factions in the game are NATO and the Canton Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty (CSAT). There are several other teams as well, including the Altis Armed Forces (AAF), the Freedom and Independence Army (FIA), the International Development and Aid Project (IDAP), the Combat Technology Research Group (CTRG), the Gendarmerie, Syndikat, and the Livonian Defense Force. The game's story is told through six campaigns: The East Wind, Remnants of War, Apex Protocol, Old Man, Tac-Ops, and First Contact. These campaigns follow different characters and groups as they go through fights on the islands and in other locations. The plot has themes of peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, espionage, and extraterrestrial phenomena.

Arma 3 was developed by Bohemia Interactive and announced in 2011. In 2012, an alpha version of the game was shown at an event called E3.

It included more showcase missions and the large island of Altis. Arma 3 uses a new version of Bohemia Interactive's Real Virtuality game engine and the SQF Syntax scripting language.

In Arma 3, there are two different kinds of extra content that can be added to the game: "platform content" and "expansion content". Platform content is already included in the game and can be tried before you buy it. Expansion content must be bought and added to the game to be used. There are many different types of platform content, such as Zeus, which lets you control a character that can change the battlefield; Karts, which adds go-karts and racing to the game; Helicopters, which adds new helicopters and missions; Marksmen, which makes sniping gameplay better; Apex, which adds a new island and new things to the game; Jets, which adds new fighter jets and objects; and Laws of War, which adds new things about helping people during a war.

Abhira

The Abhira were a legendary warriors people mentioned in Ancient Indian Epics and Scriptures as early as the Vedas.

Krishna belonged to a nomadic tribe of Abhiras known as Sāttvatas who inhabited the country near Mathura. These Sāttvatas or more properly the Yadavas of whom they were a branch were mentioned by Panini.

The term Abhira means cow-herd or a Gopa. Anthropologists came up with the view that Haryana was known by this name because in the post- Mahabharata period here lived the Abhiras, who developed special skills in the art of Agriculture. According to Pran Nath Chopra Haryana got it's name from Abhirayana=Ahirayana=Hirayana=Haryana.
The Abhiras have been described in the history of Ancient India as a tribe, which migrated from one place to another, and finally settled in various regions. They are said to have developed a complexity in their culture due to fusion of their tribal with the regional cultures and traditions, which are still living. The problem of migration is one of the most important features of the history of India, which itself based on literary and historical material, is one of the expansion of the vista of the country, which was colonized, physically and culturally by higher communities displacing the established tribals to the hilly regions and forests. The Abhiras or Ahiras are conspicuous example of this rule.

When political condition settled down and a full-fledged state system came into existence, this expansionist urge resulted in the emergence of larger and the smaller states, culminating in the empires of Indian history. The Abhiras after undergoing the process of migration from South India established kingdoms in northern and western India. It is presumed that this exciting movement of the Abhiras took place at about the beginning of the Christian era which is not very correct. At that time, their settlements are supposed to confine to Sind, Panjab, Haryana and Rajasthan—parts adjoining to Gujarat, as recorded by the Mahabharata. In the next few centuries, they consolidated themselves in Saurastra, Gujarat, Malava and khandesha, south India, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Orissa and even in Assam and Nepal. The earliest authentic reference on the Abhiras can be seen in the Mahabhasya of Patanjali (1.2.3) wherein they have been mentioned as a separate caste and have been associated with the Sudras. Other sources of our information, among others, are— Mahabharata, Ramayana, Markandeya Purana, Padma-Purdana, Mricchakatika, Prabodhacandrodaya, Pratijnayaugandharayana, and a lot of other literary works.

According to some authors, the origin of the Abhiras i is steeped in obscurity. Though there are many references about the Abhiras in Ancient India literature, hardly any of them throw any light on their origin. In support of their argument they quote Mahabhasya of Patanjali who mentions them as a tribe distinct from the Sudras, but no information about their origin is available from it. The Mahabharata depicts them living with the predatory forest tribes. According to the Bhuvanakosa chapters of the Mahabharata and the Puranas these forest tribes were organised in the form of ganas of the mercenaries and freebooters, hostile to Aryans. But in later references they have also been connected with the fourfold order of the society. According to an interpolation in the Manusmrti the Abhiras were born of an Ambastha woman and a Brahmana father.

Enthoven, an administrator of the British Raj and gentleman-scholar, believed that Abhiras might have entered India from Afghanistan. The pastoral setting of the stories about Krishna's childhood may have originated in legends of a god worshipped by the Abhira tribe. However Hugh Nevill says that it is probable the Abhiras on being removed from Mesopotamia, across the river, may have called themselves Abhira, as we know they did so in Scinde; while the branch in Afghanistan are spoked of in the Assyrian inscription as of ""the land of Abhiruz"". Ramaprasad Chanda author of ""The Indo-Aryan races"" says that the Abhiras from whom the Gujaratis of our day have evidently sprung, were Aryan in speech and belonged to the Indo-Afghan stock. The Puranic Abhiras, have occupied the territories of Herat, which is probably a survival of their name, as they are invariably juxtaposed with the Kalatoyakas and Haritas — the peoples of Afghanistan.
Journal of the Department of Pali believes that the Abhiras came to India from some part of eastern Iran. Skanda Purāṇa also puts Abhiras as one of the tribes of Afghanistan. 
Bhagwan Singh Suryavanshi says archaeological research in Deccan has revealed the presence of pastoral people of the Neolithic era who shares many attributes of the Abhira. Hence, they might have been present much earlier than has been previously postulated so. He concludes that they spread from Indus to Mathura, and migrated southward and eastward. He also says that similarity of culture and a common belief that they are descendants of Krishna is proof that they sprang from a common source.
According to a theory advanced by A. P. Karmakar, Abhiras were a Proto-Dravidian tribe, derived from Dravidian Ayir, which means cowherd. He concludes from the Padma Purana, where Vishnu informed Abhiras, "I shall be born among you, O Abhiras, at Mathura in my eighth birth". D. R. Bhandarkar supports the non-Aryan origin theory, directly relating Krishna to Rig Veda's "Krishna Drapsah", where he fights the Aryan god Indra. Abhiras were the people of Yadava community. Yadu was the eldest son of Yayati and Devyani, who was the daughter of Shukracharya. All the territory of Mathura belonged to Abhiras. Further, Mahabharata describes Abhira as forming one of the seven republics, Samsaptak Gunas, and as a friend of Matsyas, a pre-vedic tribe.
Others believe that Abhiras were originally nomadic pastoral tribes fom the lower Indus valley in modern Pakistan, who migrated eastwards and southwards across Avanti which includes districts of western Madhya Pradesh and parts of south-eastern Rajasthan. They were warriors, and after serving in the armies of various states, especially of the Sakas, some of their leaders set up an independent princes at mountainous strongholds in Southern India.

Commenting on this Bhandarkar says, Krishna is the Hinduised form of Jesus Christ, whose teachings Abhira have brought from outside, at the beginning of Christian Era, because Krishna is called Christo near Weastern Coast, and Dalliance element in Krishna's life is inspired from traditions of Abhira tribe.

Ghurye, contradicts this by saying Abhira as a tribe is mentioned in the works of Patanjali, dated 150 BC, by most conservative sources, so they definitely haven't entered at the beginning of the Christian era and possibly their presence goes very far into antiquity. Also, proofs of Extra Marital relationships exists within genealogy of Yadus so it is wrong to say Abhira are the source of Dlliance element, and he fails to see the difference between Abhira and the tribe of Krishna.

However, Smith has raised two questions on this synthesis by above scholars. First, If Abhira are Yadavs then why Mahabharata mentions them having abducted wives and children of Krishna and second, why Abhira kings names are after Shiva and not Vishnu till as late as 800AD, who is a rival god.

Dr. J.N. Singh Yadav and MSA Rao has contradicted Smith by saying, Those Abhira who abducted Krishna's Wives and Children might be Yadavs who were supporters of Duryodhna, and they also shows there is no rivalry between Shiva and Krishna.Mahabharta says that those Abhiras who looted Arjuna were the supporters of the Kauravas, and in the Mahabharata, Abhira, Gopa, Gopal and Yadavas are all synonyms.

The Yadavs, mentioned in the Mahabharata, were pastoral kshatriyas among whom Krishna was brought up. The Gopas, whom Krishna had offered to Duryodhana to fight in his support when he himself joined Arjuna's side, were no other than the Yadavs themselves, who were also the Abhiras. In the Mahabharata it is mentioned that when the Yadavas (belonging to the Abhira group) abandoned Dwaraka and Gujarat after the death of Krishna and retreated northwards under Arjuna's leadership, they were attacked and broken up.

The Bhāgavata religion was considered primarily as the religion of the Abhiras and Krishna himself came to be known as an Abhira. In the Mediaeval literature, Krishna is called an Abhira.

Gayatri is the personified form of popular Gayatri Mantra, a hymn from Vedic texts. She is also known as Savitri and Vedamata (mother of vedas).
According to Padma Purana, lord Indra brought Gayatri, an Abhira girl, to help Brahma in a Yajna in Pushkar. She was married to Brahma during Yajna.
Brahma's first wife is Savitri and Gayatri is the second. The story says that Savitri became angry knowing the wedding of Gayatri with Brahma and cursed all the gods and goddesses engaged in the event. 
However, in Padma Purana, after Savitri was appeased by Brahma, Vishnu and Lakshmi, she accepts Gayatri Abhira as her sister happily.
In some puranas, Gayatri is said to be the other names of Sarasvati, the wife of Brahma. According to Matsya Purana, Brahma's left half emerged as a female, who is celebrated under the names of Sarasvati, Savitri and Gayatri. In Kurma Purana, Gautama rishi was blessed by Goddess Gayatri and able to eliminate the obstacles he faced in his life. Skanda Purana tells that Gayatri is the wife of Brahma making her a form of Saraswati.
Gayatri further developed into a fierce goddess who could even slay a demon. According to Varaha Purana and Mahabharata, Goddess Gayatri slayed the demon Vetrasura, the son of Vritra and river Vetravati, on a Navami day.

The Chudasama dynasty, originally of Abhira clan from Sind wielded great influence around Junagadh from the 875 A.D. onwards when they consolidated themselves at Vanthali (ancient Vamanasthali) close to Girnar under their - King Ra Chuda.
A Chudasama prince styled Graharipu ruling at Vanthali near Junagadh is described in the Dyashraya-Kavya of Hemachandra as an Abhira and a Yadava.

An Ahir dynasty ruled pre-12th century areas in present-day Nepal. According to "Gopalarājvamshāvali", the genealogy of ancient Gopala dynasty compiled circa 1380s, Nepal is named after "Nepa" the cowherd, the founder of the Nepali scion of the Abhiras. In it's account, the cow that issued milk to the spot, at which "Nepa" discovered the "Jyotirlinga" of "Pashupatināth" upon investigation, was also named "Ne".

Sahrawi Peseta

The Sahrawi peseta (, ) is the currency of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. It is divided in 100 céntimos. One céntimos coins have never been minted. No banknotes have been printed.

The first coins were minted in 1990. They did not become the national coin of Western Sahara until 1997. This territory is mostly controlled by Morocco. The currency in that part of the country is the Moroccan dirham. The Algerian dinars, Mauritanian ouguiyas and the Sahrawi peseta are used in the Sahrawi refugee camps and the SADR-controlled part of Western Sahara.

Because the coins are not an official currency and are not circulating, the exchange rate is not realistic. Despite this, the Sahrawi peseta was pegged to the Spanish peseta. When the Spanish peseta was replaced with the euro, the rate became €1 for 166.386 Pts.

European eel

The European eel ("Anguilla anguilla") is a species of eel, a snake-like, catadromous fish. They are normally around 60–80 cm (2.0–2.6 ft) and rarely reach more than 1 m (3 ft 3 in), but can reach a length of up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in exceptional cases.

The European eel is a fish that resembles a serpent. It is a critically endangered species. Since the 1970s, the numbers of eels reaching Europe is thought to have declined by around 90% (possibly even 98%).



Prehistoric eel

Prehistoric eels are prehistoric ray-finned fish that are known from fossil remains. 

These prehistoric fish have snake-like bodies, like the modern eels. For example, "Nardoechelys" resembled a snake with fins. 

Prehistoric fish

Prehistoric fish are extinct fish that can be found in any clade. 

Neglected and underutilized crop

Neglected and underused crops are domesticated plant species that have been used for centuries for their food, fibre, fodder, oil or medicinal properties, but have become less important over time. There are many other terms to describe these crops. Usually, these crops are underused, because there are other, similar crops that have better properties, such as a longer shelf life. Their nutritional value may be unrecognized. Sometimes, they may also have an image problem: They may be seen as famine food, or "poor people's food". Sometimes, they have become neglected, because the way agriculture is done has changed. Some crops have been neglected so much that genetic erosion of their gene pool has become so severe that they are often seen as lost crops. 

The demand that certain crops have a given set of properties changes over time. To be able to cope with climate change, it may be necessary to have crops which are better adapted to the climate in which they are grown. Many neglected crops have been reconsidered, because they have useful properties. Examples are oil palm, soybean, and kiwifruit. They used to be neglected, and are now grown worldwide. That way, many species can contribute to food security, or a more varied diet. They may also be better for health.

It is often difficult to increase the production of these crops, and to make them suitable for large-scale agriculture. Nevertheless, may of these sepcies can contribute to food security. They can also provide for a more varied diet and be good for nutrition. Finally they can provide environmental services.

For people who are allergic, or who cannot use the regular crop for other reasons, such crops can be an alternative. People may also prefer them for an active and healthy life, especially during famine.

Just three crops - maize, wheat and rice - account for about 50% of the world's consumption of calories and protein. About 95% of the world's food needs are provided by just 30 species of plants. In contrast, at least 12,650 species names have been called edible. Neglected and underutilized plants are those that could be - and, in many cases, historically have been - used for food and other uses on a larger scale.

Such crop species have also been described as "minor", "orphan", "promising" and "little-used".

Researchers do not agree on when a crop is underutilized or neglected. In that context, neglected means that the crop hasn't seen much interest from research and development; politicians and lawyers did little to support the conservation of the crop. 

Underutilisation means that the crop isn't used very much, in a particular geographic area. The crop can contribute to better diets, or better ways of production. Just because it is little used in one geographic area does not necessarily mean that this is the case for other geographic areas.

Slow Food

Slow Food is an idea that is opposed to fast food. Many restaraunts see it as sitting down, ordering, and eating the meal within the restaraunt, as opposed to on the go. Slow food focuses on local ingredients. These ingredients are used to prepare a meal. This is in contrast to fast food, using processed ingredients. Carlo Petrini founded the movement in 1986. Even though the movement started in Italy, it soon spread to other countries. 

Slow food has the following aims:

In 2006, Petrini gave the following definition: "Buono, pulito e giusto" (good, clean, and fair) - If one of the three is missing, we are no longer talking about Slow Food.

Slow Food's aims have been compared to the Arts and Crafts movement's response to 19th-century industrialisation.

Without changing the working day of the masses, the preparation of slow food can be hard to whoever prepares food. People with more money can afford the time and expense of developing "taste", "knowledge", and "discernment". Slow Food's stated aim of preserving itself from the "contagion of the multitude" can be seen as elitist by those that consume fast food or are not part of the movement. In 1989, Petrini visited Venezuela and began to recognize the socioeconomic barriers that many faced with regard to the slow food movement. To address this, he adjusted the slow food agenda to include an alternative food approach that favored healthy, local, community-based food consumption and production. While this made the slow food movement more accessible for many, it did not eliminate all of the socioeconomic barriers faced by the movement.

Heirloom plant

Heirloom plant is the name for a cultivar of a plant, that was used in the past, but that is no longer used for large-scale production. Such plants are often grown on a smaller scale. Very often, people grow them in their garden.

Food security

Food security means that everyone in a specific geographical area has access to food. This also means that the food is affordable. That way everyone in the area can get enough food for a varied diet, with enough nutrients. This is especially important for staple food. If there's no food security, malnutrition and famine will result. People who cannot get enough food will also be more likely to start riots. 

If there is no food security, this is called food insecurity. One of the reasons for food insecurity is that there are special markets (like stock markets) for food (called commodities). Like with other goods, supply and demand influence the price. Grains can also be used as a food for livestock, or the can be processed to produce biofuel. These resources are then no longer directly available as food. People can place a bet on rising (or falling prices), something that is called a future. External events, such as bad harvests, or wars also influence the price. 

Food insecurity as the limitation or unavailability of nutritionally adequate food or the inability to acquire acceptable foods.



Fish migration

Many species of fish move from one body of water to another. Many fish do this on a regular basis. If it is done by many fish, it is usually called fish migration. The timespans and distances vary. Some migrations occur everyday, others take months or years. Some migrations are seasonal. Sometimes fish move within the same body of water. They may spend the day near the surface and move to deeper sections at night, for example.

Common forms of migration:

Common reasons for migrations include that they find more food at the other place, or that they move there to spawn. In some cases, the reasons for the migration are unknown.


Cornufer vitianus

The Viti wrinkled ground frog, Fiji land frog or Fiji ground frog ("Cornufer vitianus") is a frog. It lives in some of the Fiji Islands. Scientists have seen it between 0 and 830 meters above sea level.

The adult female frog is about 48.8-110 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult male frog is 25-59.7 mm long. It has disks on its toes for climbing. It has teeth in both its upper and lower jaw. This frog can be different colors. Some are brown. Some are red-brown. Some are green-brown. Some are dark brown. Most of them have a mark in the shape of an X and a white spot on their backs. Some have a white stripe in the middle of the back. The belly is lighter in color.

The female frog lays eggs on the ground. She hides them in rotten dead tree trunks. She lays about 40 eggs at a time.

This frog can swim and jump very well. When the frog thinks it is in danger, it puffs itself full of air to look bigger. It stores water in its bladder and lets it outs before jumping.

There are fewer of this frog than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives and because of other animals that want to eat it. Some of these animals have lived in the Fiji islands for a long time. Others came there because humans brought them. The most important predators are the mongoose, rat, cat, and cane toad. Now, this frog only lives on islands where there are no mongoose.

Crown of thorns

According to the New Testament, a woven crown of thorns ( or ) was placed on the head of Jesus during the events leading up to his crucifixion. It was one of the instruments of the Passion, used by Jesus' captors both to cause him pain and to mock his claim of authority. It is mentioned in the gospels of Matthew (Matthew 27:29), Mark (Mark 15:17) and John (John 19:2, 19:5), and is often alluded to by the early Church Fathers, such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen and others, and was referenced in the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.

Lynching postcard

A lynching postcard is a postcard showing a lynching. Lynchings are extrajudicial killings, and are often driven by racial hatred. Like other postcards, these postcards were intended to be souvenirs. These postcards often had racist texts written on them. Lynching postcards were popular in the United States, and the US Postal Service was forbidden from distributing them in 1908.

Many lynchings had a racist background. White racists used them as propaganda. Lynchings were most common between the 1880s and the 1940s. At first, they were used to intimidate African Americans, who had more rights after the civil war. Later they were also used to intimidate voters and civil rights workers, independently of their race. The common practice was that a mob would force them out of their homes, or from prison cells, and then murder them. This happened without a trial.

Like with other events of the time, postcards were made about the event. Often, the people taking the photographs were those killing the victims.

In a typical lynching postcard, the victim is displayed prominently at the center of the shot, smiling spectators, often including children, are at the margins of the frame. Facial expressions suggesting remorse, guilt, shame, or regret are rare.


Daniel in the lions' den

Daniel in the lions' den refers to a story in Chapter 6 of the Book of Daniel in the Bible. Daniel – a noble Jewish youth and Biblical prophet – continues to pray to the God of Israel instead of his royal master, Darius the Mede. As a result, he is sent into a den of lions to be eaten. However, an angel sent by God saves Daniel and he emerged miraculously unharmed the next day. 

By analogy, Daniel's situation has become an English language idiom for a hostile environment.

Hello Kitty (song)

"Hello Kitty" is a song by the Canadian singer Avril Lavigne. It is from her fifth studio album "Avril Lavigne" (2013). 

It was written by Lavigne, Chad Kroeger, David Hodges and Martin Johnson, while the song was produced by Kroeer, Hodges, and additional production by Brandon Paddock and Kyle Moorman. Musically, "Hello Kitty" is a bubblegum pop song heavily influenced by hard rock and pop punk, while featuring a dubstep-influenced drop. The song stands out as Lavigne's first electronic experimental track in her career to date. The song is about an "aggressive" love affair with the fictional character, where it includes Lavigne commenting on sleepovers, having fun and eating. The song was influenced with her obsession with all things kitty like

Upon its flagship release with the album, "Hello Kitty" received polarizing reviews from contemporary music critics. Many found it interesting and compared the experimental production. But some dismissed this and criticized the lyrical content and felt that it failed to make a positive impression. The song charted at number 84 on the South Korean Gaon Chart. An official lyric video was released on Lavigne's YouTube account on January 19.

Three months after the release of "Goodbye Lullaby", Lavigne announced that she had already begun on her fifth studio album, with eight songs written so far. Lavigne stated that musically the album would be the opposite of "Goodbye Lullaby", with a rumoured released date of sometime in 2012. Lavigne explained, ""Goodbye Lullaby" was more mellow, [but] the next one will be pop and more fun again. I already have a song that I know is going to be a single, I just need to re-record it!" It was written by Lavigne, Chad Kroeger, David Hodges and Martin Johnson, while the song was produced by Kroeer, Hodges and additional production by Brandon Paddock and Kyle Moorman. The song was engineered by John Hanes, musical mixed by Serban Ghenea and additional programming was held by Paddick and Moorman. 

Musically, "Hello Kitty" is known to be Lavigne's most experimental track to date, as its musical influences are inspired by bubblegum pop, pop punk and dubstep. In an interview, Lavigne said about her collaboration with Kroeger; "I have a song called [Hello Kitty], which I wrote about [Hello Kitty] because I’m obsessed, and it’s a really fun thing that I’ve never done before. It kind of has a kind of glitchy, electronic feel to it and it’s... the only one on the record that sounds like that. It’s really different and a lot of my friends I’ve played it for really like it. I’m having a lot of fun with that one." Lyrically, Lavigne told Digital Spy; "'Hello Kitty' was such an interesting topic and subject [...] It was really exciting for me. I didn't want it to sound like anything I'd done before. I wanted it to sound over the top so I ended up hiring a new producer to help me with it." She was later asked about the double meaning abut the song, to which she responded "Obviously it's flirtatious and somewhat sexual, but it's genuinely about my love for Hello Kitty as well." Additonally, she said at MuchMusic "It’s really fun [and] it’s about a slumber party and loving the kitty."

"Entertainment Weekly"'s Nick Catucci exclaimed "Hello Kitty," a dubstep track that seems to acknowledge its own tokenism by adopting a "J-Pop American Funtime Now!" sheem (and whose title may or may not enclose a double entendre that in any case I’d rather not entertain) [...]" Craig Manning from "AbsoultePunk" said "The biggest leap of faith is made on “Hello Kitty,” a trippy patchwork of EDM and pop that pays loving tribute to Lavigne's sizable Japanese following." "Muumuse"'s Bradley Stern had discussed the song in a lengthy review and explained; "Hello Kitty" is an offbeat EDM-infused stomper. Conjuring Gwen Stefani's lively Japanese-minded Love.Angel.Music.Baby (plus a Fashionable Dubstep Breakdown for good measure!), Avril lets her love affair for the beloved Japanese mascot go wild across pulsing beats and sputtering electronica as she shouts outs hilarious commands: "Like a fat kid on a pack of smarties / Someone chuck a cupcake at me!" He also referred Lavigne's nature towards the song as "insane".

Karl Adamek

Karl Adamek (23 July 1910 in Vienna – 8 January 2000) was an Austrian footballer and manager. He played as defender for different teams in Vienna and from 1933 till 1935 for Le Havre AC in France.
Karl Adamek was a trained butcher and waiter. He began his career as a football player with Brigittenauer AC and switched to the well-known Wiener AC for two years in 1929. After a short time with Floridsdorfer AC, he went back to Brigittenau. !932-22 he played for Austria Wien. In this time he debuted for the Austrian national football team in a 4-3 away win on 17 July 1932. He played eight matches for Austria.

In the winter of 1933 he left Austria and played for Le Havre, France, in the second division. However, his international career was interrupted by this transfer, as footballers playing abroad were rarely named in the national team at that time. Before he ended his active career after the 1946/47 season, Adamek celebrated his third runner-up title in the second post-war championship with Austria Wien and reached the cup final for the last time, which they lost 4-3 to SC Wacker Wien.

After the end of his playing career, Karl Adamek turned into a successful coach. From 1952 to 1957 managed IFK Norrköping in Sweden. Then he coached Austria Wien. 1958 he took over the second division club Atalanta Bergamo in Italy and led it back into the first division. Other coaching stations Adameks abroad were Norway ( Örgryte IS, Bodø/Glimt, HamKam) and Switzerland (FC Biel). Adamek's next stop was at Sturm Graz, with whom he was promoted to the Staatsliga in July 1966 after taking over the club in January 1965. At the beginning of the 1970s he coached SV Heid Stockerau.

LaFace Records

Indian WhatsApp lynchings

There were several cases of mob-related violence, after rumours of child abduction and organ harvesting. The cases happened in rural India. They are known as Indian WhatsApp lynchings today. The application WhatsApp, which runs on mobile phones was used to spread the rumours.

The murders started in May 2017, when seven men were killed in Jharkhand. These cases did not get national attention until the following year. 

The messages that are circulated are false. They contain some local details. Sometimes a real video is attached to the message, or claim. 
In almost all of the lynching locations, no child abductions had been recorded in the previous three months.

Most of the attacks have occurred in villages. The lynch mobs included men, women and children. In some cases the mobs were composed largely of illiterate or poorly educated men that were unemployed or working as day labourers; often, they were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the attack. In at least some of the cases prime instigators have used child-abduction fears to stir up the violence and settle old scores.

David and Jonathan

David and Jonathan were, according to the Hebrew Bible's Books of Samuel, heroic figures of the Kingdom of Israel, who formed a covenant, taking a mutual oath.

The Bible does not explicitly depict the nature of the relationship between David and Jonathan. The traditional and mainstream religious interpretation of the relationship has been one of platonic love and an example of homosociality. Some later Medieval and Renaissance literature drew upon the story to underline strong personal friendships between men.

In modern times, some scholars, writers, and activists have emphasized what they see as elements of homoeroticism in the story.


Binding of Isaac

The Binding of Isaac (, ), or simply "The Binding" (, ), is a story from Genesis 22 of the Hebrew Bible. 

In the story, God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac at Moriah. Abraham does this by binding (tying) Isaac to an altar, but is is stopped by an angel, who says "Do not lay a hand on the boy ... Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son". A ram (male sheep) appears instead, and is sacrificed instead.

In addition to being addressed by modern scholarship, this biblical episode has been the focus of a great deal of commentary in traditional sources of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Anti-Zionism

Anti-Zionism means opposition to Zionism. It is commonly associated with the State of Israel. People that supports Anti-Zionism ideology are known as Anti-Zionist. The ideology started in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Jews from Europe and other places began to come and settle in the region of Palestine. Anti-Zionists consider Zionism as Settler Colonialism. 

Anti-Zionism includes, for example, criticism of the current policies of the state of Israel as well as moral, ethical, or religious criticism of the idea of a Jewish nation-state. Criticism of Israeli policies is mainly about, its occupation of the West Bank, Golan Heights, and a Lebanese territory named Shebaa farms since 1967 and blockade of the Gaza Strip for more then 17 years. Israelis and some Americans consider Anti-Zionism as Anti-Semitism. Until World War II, anti-Zionism was widespread among Jews for different reasons. Orthodox Jews opposed Zionism on religious grounds, as preempting the Messiah. Anti-Zionists criticize the idea of a Jewish state on various grounds, including concerns about the killing and displacement of Palestinian communities (which happened during Nakba and happens till today), the nature of national identity, and geopolitical implications. Opposition to Zionism was, and continues to be high in the Arab world, especially among Palestinians.

Countries or militant groups that have a Anti Zionism ideology often refers to the State of Israel as a zionist entity. In countries like Iran or Kuwait, the state run media don't use the word 'Israel' and a time when one of the Kuwaiti channel used the word Israel by mistake it apologized to the Arab people.

The frogs live in many parts of Palau. Palau is an archipelago, or group of islands. The frogs live on all the larger islands and many of the small ones, but they do not live in the southwest. Scientists have seen that the frogs do not live on some islands that have all the right food and other conditions. They do not know why the frogs do not live there too.

These frogs can live in places where human beings have changed the area. They live in forests, but they spread out. In back yards and farms, sometimes many frogs appear at the same time.

These frogs do not become tadpoles. Instead, they hatch out of their eggs as small frogs. Scientists do not know how the frogs mate. Because the male frog is so much smaller than the female frog, the male frog cannot fertilize eggs by holding on to the female frog as she lays them.

Singh

Singh is derived from the Sanskrit word Siṃha meaning "lion". It is a common title, middle name, or surname in Northern India originally used by the Kshatriyas warriors and kings. Singh was first used as a surname by Ahir kings

As per the instructions of Guru Gobind Singh, the use of Singh as a middle or a last name is mandatory for all baptized male Sikhs since 1699, regardless of their geographical or cultural binding. The surname has also been widely adopted by other groups of India like Yadavs and Jats. Some Brahmins like Bhumihar Brahmins and Maithil Brahmins also use this name. "Singh" has gradually emerged as a hereditary title to be used as a middle name, highlighting connections to a warrior status or occupation. However, this is not an exclusive usage, and many Hindu groups including Scheduled Castes and Vaishya have adopted this title without any significant warrior status or ties.

Singh is used by Sikhs, Bhumihar Brahmins and Kshatriya communities such as Gurjars, Jats, Rajputs, Yadavs etc. as either a middle name or a surname. e.g. Kotwal Dhan Singh Gurjar, Chaudhary Charan Singh, Maharaja Bhim Singh Rana, Mulayam Singh Yadav etc.

Zwiastowanie (obraz Fra Angelica)

The Annunciation - an altar painting painted around 1426 by Fra Angelico for the monastery of Santo Domenico in Fiesole, near Florence. The work was made in the tempera technique with the use of gold. The altar is kept in the Prado Museum. The Annunciation scene takes place under a portico with a light structure made of thin columns. On the left, in the depths of the garden, you can see the scene of Adam and Eve's expulsion from Paradise. The predella shows scenes from the life of Mary: the birth of Mary, the wedding with St. Joseph, visitation of St. Elizabeth, the birth of Christ, the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple and the Assumption of Mary. Fra Angelico painted exclusively religious pictures, conceiving art as a form of glorifying the Creator. He very precisely reflected the nature and features of the presented characters. In his style, he combined late Italian Gothic with a new - Renaissance - formula of art. An example of this is the spaciousness of architecture in his works.

1800 United States presidential election

The United States presidential election of 1800 was the fourth American presidential election between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. Adams and Jefferson had awkwardly worked as president and vice president together for the previous four years, and it was a rematch of the 1796 election. In the end, Jefferson beat Adams and the long streak of Democratic-Republican presidents began. This election is referred to as the "Revolution of 1800" because it changed American politics a lot.

Before the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the second place winner was the vice president. Because of this, Thomas Jefferson became John Adams' vice president even though they hated each other. This caused it to be an awkward time as the enemies had to work together. When the 1800 election rolled around, everyone was divided and furious. Adams had passed many unpopular laws like the Alien and Sedition Acts. John Adams was also called out for being too friendly with Britain, and his supporters responded by calling Jefferson supporters "Radical Atheists". This was the last election in America before the twelfth amendment was passed. There were technically two other people running, but they were more like vice presidential candidates. If electors supported one candidate, they were told to put their other vote to that candidate's unofficial vice president nominee, expecting that if they won, the other person would be in second place. John Adams' unofficial vice president candidate was Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and Jefferson's was Aaron Burr.

Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr both got 73 electoral votes. However, since they got the same, the Senate had to vote on which one would become president and which one would be vice president. Jefferson, obviously, ended up being president. However, it was hard because the Senate was still controlled by people who didn't like Jefferson and Burr. Adams got 65 electoral votes. His vice president candidate, Pinckney, got 64, with the one other vote going to John Jay. If Adams was reelected, he wouldn't have had to deal with the Senate vote.

Francis La Flesche

Francis La Flesche (1857-1932) was one of the first early indigenous anthropologists and the first professional Native American ethnologist. He was a member of the Omaha Tribe. He was an informant for the ethnographer and linguist James Owen Dorsey, who was getting information on the Omaha. He also worked closely with Alice Fletcher as her interpreter and fellow researcher of Omaha culture. After working with Fletcher, he published his works on the Omaha and Osage Tribes with the Smithsonian.

Francis was the child of the Chief Principle Joseph La Flesche and an Omaha woman named Tainne. His father was of Ponca Indian and French descent; his mother was full Omof aha. His father pushed white culture onto him, but he was pulled towards the Omaha culture and knew how to read, write, and speak the language.

La Flesche attended the Presbyterian Mission school on the reservation until it closed in 1869. After the school closed, he continued his English language education by reading the bible out loud to his father. Later in life, while working at the Smithsonian Institution, he got two degrees, a bachelor’s degree in law from National University in 1892 and a master’s degree in 1893.

La Flesche's first job in the field was as an interpreter and informant for James Owen Dorsey of the Bureau of American Ethnography. For that year, Dorsey was there in 1878; La Flesche helped Dorsey record Omaha's culture and caused him to become interested in recording Omaha's songs and instruments.

In 1879, Francis traveled east with his sister Susette, the Ponca chief Standing Bear, and the Omaha journalist Thomas H. Tibbles for Indian Land Reform. After this trip, he took a job as a clerk at the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C. During his time there; he met Alice Fletcher. La Flesche started working closely as her interpreter. Later he turned into a partner in ethnography, and she even adopted him as her son. Together they recorded, sorted, and put together over 30 years of work on the Omaha Tribe into a complete publication known as "The Omaha Tribe."

After this work together, he was sent to work at the Bureau of American Ethnology. There they sent him to Oklahoma to study with the Osage Tribe. He recorded the songs, chants, and music of the Osage people and wrote reports on them during his time at the bureau. Those recordings are still available to listen to today. La Flesche worked at the bureau until 1928 when he retired and moved back to Nebraska to live with his family.

La Flesche was a member of the Washington Academy of Sciences. He also got an honorary doctorate from the University of Nebraska. Francis La Flesche died in 1932 on the Omaha Reservation in Nebraska. La Flesche helped record and document important parts of the Osage and Omaha Tribes Culture for other anthropologists and community members to look back on for research and good memories.

Francis produced many famous works. Two with Alice Fletcher, known as "A Study of Omaha Music" (1893) and "The Omaha Tribe" (1911). Some of his own works known as "The Middle Five: Indian Boys at School" (1900), an autobiography about his time at the mission boarding school, a play called "Da-o-ma" (1912), that was never truly published, "Who was the Medicine Man?" (1904), "A Dictionary of the Osage Language," and his most famous work "The Osage Tribe"(1922-1930) published in four separate volumes of the Bureau of American Ethnology annual reports.

He was a member of the Warsaw City Organization. In February 1863, he carried out an action to take over staff maps, and in June of the same year - the Cash Office of the Central Government Revenue and Treasury Commission of the Kingdom of Poland. Appointed the last insurgent warden of Warsaw, he held this position from December 10, 1863 to December 19, 1864, when he was accidentally arrested on Elektoralna Street. He was aware of the impossibility of reversing the fall of the uprising, but by issuing orders and proclamations he tried to maintain the impression that the municipal organization was still functioning. He had no permanent residence; he spent the night in the mill buildings in Solec, and spent his days reading newspapers in cafes. He consciously decided not to go out of town.

He was imprisoned in the 10th pavilion of the Warsaw Citadel. He was executed on its slopes on February 17, 1865 together with Emanuel Szafarczyk. It was the last public execution of participants in the uprising in Warsaw.

Serrasalmidae

Serrasalmidae is the family of piranhas. All are native to South America. It includes several living genera like "Serrasalmus", and an extinct genus called "Megapiranha". 

Piranhas have sharp teeth. A pycnodont called "Piranhamesodon" has teeth resembling a piranha. The bluefish is called the marine piranha because of its teeth. 

The Serrasalmidae were recently classified as a subfamily of the Characidae. However, the classification of these fish is still not certain. Despite this, the Serrasalmidae are relatively well understood. The genera and species are widely agrees.

The fossil record, particularly for piranhas, is relatively sparse. Most known fossils are from the Miocene. Two were in the Upper Cretaceous. 

Many serrasalmids are in demand as aquarium ornamentals, and several such as "Piaractus" and "Colossoma", are economically important to commercial fisheries and aquaculture.

Piranhas are generally less valued, although they are commonly consumed by subsistence fishers and frequently sold for food in local markets.

Lampriformes

Lampriformes is an order of ray-finned fish. They are known as lamprids. A synonym for this order is called Lampridiformes, but it is an apparently incorrect spelling variant.

Caroline Lacroix

Blanche Zélia Joséphine Delacroix, better known as Caroline Lacroix (13 May 1883 – 12 February 1948), was the most well known mistress of Leopold II of Belgium.

Delacroix was of French origin. She met Leopold in Paris as a young girl. She was only 16 and he was 65. At that time, she was a prostitute. They soon started a relationship. It lasted until his death in 1909. Leopold gave her large sums of money, estates and gifts. He also gave her a noble title, "baronne de Vaughan" (Baroness Vaughan). Because of these presents, Caroline was unpopular in Belgium and other countries. People did not like the greedy actions of Leopold in the Congo Free State. This area was his own personal colony. Since Caroline was being supported by the king's income from the colony, she became known as La reine du Congo ("The Queen of the Congo").

She and Leopold married in a religious ceremony five days before his death. The did not have a civil ceremony so the marriage was not legal under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was learned that he had left her many properties, items of high value and other valuable sources of income. All of this turned her into a multimillionaire. For years, the Belgian government and Leopold's daughters tried to recover some of these items. They had varying ammounts of success. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 in Cambo-les-Bains, France.

Morbid Angel

Morbid Angel is an American death metal band. It was made in Tampa, Florida in 1983. It was made by Trey Azagthoth, Dallas Ward, and Mike Browning. Morbid Angel was one of the first death metal bands. They helped make death metal by playing thrash metal that sounded different. They were one of the first bands that used blast beats (a very fast type of drumming) and death metal singing. They were the first death metal band to make successful music. This is because they were a part of a large record label and their music videos were shown on MTV many times. 

Their first three albums have inspired many other death metal musicians. These are "Altars of Madness" (1989), "Blessed Are the Sick" (1991), and "Covenant" (1993). These albums are about things such as Satanism and the occult. Other Morbid Angel albums are about things such as Sumerian gods, and have anti-religious lyrics.

The band's music is very complex. "Decibel", a magazine, said that Trey Azagthoth was the best death metal guitarist ever. Azagthoth is the only original member still in the band. Morbid Angel is one of the best-selling death metal bands. Their third album, "Covenant", sold over 150,000 copies.


Silky Spitz

The Silky Spitz (in German: Seidenspitz) was a breed of dog. It was also known as the Silky-Haired Spitz. The dog was bred in Germany around 1800. It was created by mating the white Pomeranian with the Maltese. The Silky Spitz had a pure white colored coat. It had the long silky hair of the Maltese and pricked ears of the Pomeranian. The nose and eyes of the dog were both very black. The Silky Spitz was a delicate dog. It had feet similar to those of a rabbit. The dog was about the size of the Pomeranian. To make the dogs look more Pomeranian, the paws, ears and face were trimmed, This was because these areas were hairy like the Maltese. Breeding in Germany died out between World War I and World War II. There were some possible reasons for this. One of these is that the breed had small litters. there were usually only two puppies per litter. Inbreeding, a small number of breeders and diseases are also believed to be reasons for this.

From 2005, the Seidenspitz was bred in the United States.

Ahir

The Ahir or Abhir (also transliterated as Aheer and Abhira) also called Yaduvanshi is an Yadav caste found in India and Nepal, They consider themselves descendants of Krishna of the Yaduvamsha and traditionally call themselves Yaduvanshi and use their surname Yadav. The Ahir word is derived from the Sanskrit word Abhira which means Fearless or Cowherd (Gopa), who were once found in different parts of India and Nepal, and who wielded political power in several places. The Abhiras are equated with Ahirs, Gopas and Gollas, and all of them are considered Yadavas. It appears, Ahir caste believes that their dynasty is derived from Yadu dynasty, meanwhile Day (12) points out that 'Bishwaparwa' mythology of Mahabharata (it is a section of sacred text 'Mahabharata') reveals that the second name of 'Yadu' was Ahir because he killed 'Ahi' (snake). Madhu say all the territory of Mathura belongs to Abhira (Ahir and the Abhira often used synonymously).

The Abhira (Ahir) were named Gope when they protected the cows, and Gopal when they tended and grazed the cows. 23 In the period (from 500 B.C. to 1 B.C.) when the Pali language was prevalent in India, the word 'Gopal was modified to 'Goal' and by further modification it took the form of Gwal. This has been aptly described by an unknown poet 24 in a verse that" due to rearing cattle, the Yadav are called ' Gope', and after being called' Gopal', they are called' Gwal.

There are many theories regarding their origin. Most of them link the Ahirs to a people known to the ancients as the Abhiras, the term Ahir being a Prakrit form of the Sanskrit word Abhira, meaning (fearless or cowherd Gopa). The Greek writers Peripleus and Ptolemy have mentioned Aberia (considered by some scholars to be a settlement of the Abhiras) as part of IndoScythia, which included practically the whole region along the lower course of the Indus. By the middle of the second century before Christ, the Abhira country was overrun by Bactrian Greeks from the north. Thus driven, the Abhiras moved south and established many centres of influence. Some authorities are of the view that the Abhiras were a dynamic race of nomadic cowherds from central or East Asia who swarmed into India through the Punjab around the same time as the Sakas, the Parthians and the Kushans in the second or first century before Christ. There are others who believe that the Ahirs are of Dravidian origin and were well established in the country before the Aryan invasion. While the origin of the Abhiras or Ahirs is thus immersed in controversy, there is no doubt that their assimilation with the Yadavas was complete by the twelfth century. It is likely that the name 'Haryana' is itself derived from the word Ahir. The Yadavas dominated the plains between the Sutlej and the Jamuna when the epic battle of Mahabharata was fought at Kurukshetra, north-west of Kama. Their hold over the region must have lasted many centuries after that battle till most of them were pushed out of their homelands by waves of invaders from the north-west during the early years of the Christian era. This was, however, only a temporary set-back. In course of time we find the Yadavas coming into their own, under different names, in the lands they moved into. The Yadava clans that set up their own kingdoms in Southern India include such famous names as the Mauryas, Shalivahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, the Yadavas of Devagiri, Hoysalas and Halebidis of Karnataka.

According to Historian P.N. Chopra, The Ahirs today claim descent from Krishna. Their origin, however, is controversial. Some historians hold that they were a powerful race of nomad cowherds from eastern or Central Asia who entered India from the Punjab in large hordes about the same time as the Sakas and the Yuechis in the first or second century BC and gradually spread over large parts of Northern, Eastern and Central India. Other views are that they came from Syria or Asia Minor about the beginning of the Christian era; were Dravidians; sprang from the Aayars of Tamil Nadu; lived in India long before the Aryan invasion; were descendants of the Yadavas of the Lunar family of Pururavas Aila; and that their original habitat was the region between the Sutlej and the Yamuna from where they migrated beyond Mathura in the East and beyond Gujarat and Maharashtra in the South.

The term Ahir is derived from Abhira, a clan mentioned several times in inscriptions and Hindu revered books. The term Ahir is often seen as synonymous with Yadav. The Mahabharata and other authori-tative works use the three terms-Ahir, Yadav and Gopa synonymous.

However, most books publiced as recently as 2001, 2005, propogates the dubious theories generated based on old new paper articles and court records, that present day Yadav caste is merely renamed Ahirs who switched their identity in 1922 to Yadav as part of Sanskritization movement of certain Hindu castes. The facts mentioned in the Ahir taken a false identitiy of Yadav is incorrect. And these false informations are propogated in recently publised books, which no authority in subject. The book contents are based on news paper articles and courts records, whose validities are as genuine as a lawyer's statement.

The British census in 1881, half century before any Sanskritization movement, the census mentions Yadavs as Ahirs. It says "The Yadavs, who in their turn are identified with the Ahirs and Gaolis, were the dominant race at that time.

Hemachandra, in the Dyashraya-Kavya, describe the Ahir King Graharipu, ruling at Vanthali near Junagadh, as an Ahir and a Yadav. Again, many remains of Khandesh (historical stronghold of Ahirs) are popularly believed to be of Gawli Raj, which archaeologically belongs to the Yadvas of Devgiri. Hence, it is concluded that Yadavs of Devagiri were actually Ahirs. This receives some support from the fact that Yaduvanshis even now are one of the most important sub-divisions of the Ahirs.

According to Historian T Padmaja, the Ahirs migrated to Tamil Nadu and established their kingdoms and in inscriptions these Ahirs mention they are from Yadav lineage. 

Ahir/Yadavs are traditionally warriors-cowherders and farmers. Formerly the Ahir/Yadavs had the exclusive right to milk cows. Their role with the sacred cows gave them special status. They are found not only in the Kaatch (Kutch) area of western Gujarat, but also in Eastern Rajasthan, Southern Haryana, Northern Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Central Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and also in Nepal and Pakistan. The Ahir (Yadav) community are present in large numbers in Terai, the plains that lie in the southern part of Nepal.

The Narayani Army which the Krishna organised and which made him so powerful that his friendship was eagerly sought by the greatest kings of his time, is described in the Mahabharata as being all of the Ahir caste.

The British Rulers of India classified the Ahirs amongst the "martial races" It was a designation created by officials of British India to describe "races" that were thought to be naturally warlike and aggressive in battle, and to possess qualities like courage, physical strength, fighting tenacity and military strategy. The Ahirs may be seen to have continued their warrior tradition by their extensive participation in the Indian Army and police forces. Since ancient time, as per Mahabharata, Ahirs have been warriors; some were agriculturists and farmers. Ahir’s have been serving the Indian military right from the British period and won the highest of gallantry awards like Victoria Cross and the Param Veer Chakra. In the annals of Indian military history there is sufficient proof of Ahir bravery that is immortalized in the ballads of Alha and Udal of Bundelkhand. In 1962, a company of 120 Ahir men laid down their lives fighting against the Chinese - the Commander, (Major) Shaitan Singh was posthu-mously awarded the Param Vir Chakra. Equally meritorious was the Ahirs' record in the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965 and the heroes of Chusol (Ladakh) are famous.

Zignoichthys

Zignoichthys is an extinct genus of prehistoric pufferfish. In life, it would have resembled a paunchy triggerfish. It lacked a pelvis, and could not inflate its body like its modern-day relatives.

"Zignoichthys" was a pufferfish that looked paunchy in appearance. Unlike the modern pufferfish, it could not puff up to about twice its normal size by gulping water.



Triggerfish

Triggerfish are about 40 species of often brightly colored fish of the family Balistidae. Triggerfish are native to tropical waters. A prehistoric pufferfish called "Zignoichthys" bore a resemblance to them.

Most are found in shallow, coastal habitats, especially at coral reefs, but a few, such as the ocean triggerfish are pelagic. Triggerfish are very popular in the marine aquarium trade. However, they are often grumpy.

There are reports that triggerfish have attacked humans due to them being territorial, but these attacks are extremely rare.

Triggerfish have an oblong-shaped, laterally compressed body. The head is large, having a small but strong mouth with teeth adapted for crushing shells.

They have small eyes set far back from the mouth and at the top of the head. To protect themselves from predators, triggerfish can erect the first two dorsal spines: The first (anterior) spine is locked in place by erection of the short second spine, and can be unlocked only by depressing the second, "trigger" spine, hence the name triggerfish.

The stone triggerfish ("Pseudobalistes naufragium") reaches 1 m (3.3 ft) and is the largest of them all. The titan triggerfish ("Balistoides viridescens") is also relatively large, but it is not the largest ever.

Some male species (i.e. "Balistes carolinensis" and "Pseudobalistes flavimarginatus") build hollow nests within their territories. They often like to guard their territories as having a territory is essential for reproduction.

The species "Xanthichthys mento" and yellowmargin triggerfish have eggs spawned in the morning. They hatch after the sunset (more specifically, night), which is unusual.

A triggerfish lays its demersal eggs in a small hole that has been dug into the seabed. Off Florida, juveniles of some triggerfish are found in floating sargassums, where they often feed on small shrimp, crabs, and mollusks.


There is also an extinct genus:
They'll feed on benthic invertebrates, such as crabs, sea urchins, shrimp, sand dollars, lobsters, and mollusks.

Some species of triggerfish, such as the titan triggerfish, may be ciguatoxic and cannot be eaten. Others, however, such as the grey triggerfish ("Balistes capriscus"), are edible, meaning you can eat them.

Triggerfish can bite and suck blood from its attacker to weaken them.

John Middleton (giant)

John Middleton was an English giant who was born in the village of Hale and is commonly known as the Childe of Hale. He was claimed to be 9 feet 3 inches (2.82 m) tall, and legend tells that he slept with his feet out of the window of his small house, and stories credit him with great strength. He was employed as a bodyguard by the sheriff of Lancashire.

Middleton was born in the village of Hale, near Liverpool. According to modern accounts and his gravestone, he grew to the height of and slept with his feet hanging out the window of his house. 

Because of his size the landlord and sheriff of Lancashire, Gilbert Ireland, hired him as a bodyguard. When King James I stopped by in 1617 to knight Ireland he heard about Middleton and invited both of them to the court, which they accepted in 1620. Middleton beat the King's champion in wrestling and in doing so broke the man's thumb. He received £20 which was a large amount of money in those times. Jealous of his wealth, Middleton's companions mugged him or cheated him out of his money while he was returning to Hale. Middleton died very poor in 1623. He was buried in the cemetery of St Mary's Church in Hale. His gravestone reads, "Here lyeth the bodie of John Middleton the Childe of Hale. Nine feet three. Borne 1578 Dyede 1623." He is likely one of the tallest people in history. If these height markings are accurate, he would go past Robert Wadlow's height of .

There have been many local uses and memorials of honor of Middleton; a pub in Hale, named The Childe of Hale, has a copy of the Brasenose College portrait as its sign. In 1996 a large tree trunk opposite the church was carved with representations of John Middleton, Hale Lighthouse and other local symbols. In 2011, because of disease and in the interests of public safety the tree trunk was removed by Halton Borough Council. In April 2013, the wooden sculpture was replaced by a bronze statue tall by sculptor Diane Gorvin.
Brasenose College in Oxford possesses a life-sized portrait, two smaller paintings and two life-sized representations of his hands. Another life-sized portrait can be seen at Speke Hall in Liverpool, a National Trust property. Although he was said to be tall, some experts suggested that he was only tall, believing his hands were not measured accurately according to records. However, his remains were supposed to be removed from his grave during the Victorian era but were worked out to about 9'3".
Speke Hall, near Hale, incorporates a natural area with trees showing his house, feet, hands and other items.

Indo-Pacific

The Indo-Pacific is a biogeographic region of Earth. It is also known as the Indo-West Pacific or Indo-Pacific Asia. It includes the waters of the Indian Ocean, the western and central Pacific Ocean, and the seas connecting the two in the general area of Indonesia. 

It does not include the temperate and polar regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans, nor the Tropical Eastern Pacific, along the Pacific coast of the Americas, which is also a distinct marine realm. The term is used in marine biology, ichthyology, and similar fields. This is because many marine habitats are connected from Madagascar to Japan and Oceania, and a number of species occur over that range, but are not found in the Atlantic Ocean. 

The WWF and Nature Conservancy divide the Indo-Pacific into 3 realms.

The Central Indo-Pacific is a part of the larger Indo-Pacific.

The Eastern Indo-Pacific is another part of the Indo-Pacific.

The Western Indo-Pacific is a part of the Indo-Pacific.

Former Prime Minister of Australia Paul Keating, in a televised address at the National Press Club, criticized the notion of the Indo-Pacific as a construct of the United States in its diplomatic war with China:The United States says, well, that's all very interesting. But look, if you behave yourself, you Chinese. You can be a stakeholder in our system. And look, you wouldn't have to be Xi Jinping or anybody, to take the view of your Chinese Nationalist say, "Well, hang on, let me get this right. We are already one and a quarter times bigger than you, will soon be twice as big as you, and we may be two and a half times as big as you. But we can be a stakeholder in your system, is that it?" I mean, it’d make a cat laugh.

Microscopium

Microscopium is a minor constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere.

DNS hijacking

The Domain Name System is a way to map a domain name to an IP address. DNS hijacking, DNS poisoning, and DNS redirection are names for changing this mapping. Usually, this is done by pointing to a different name server. This name server will then return a different IP address for the domain. 

Hackers use this, for example for phishing, or to show advertisments. The government also uses it sometimes: accessing certain domains may be illegal, in certain countries. Using this technique, the government can require internet service providers to block such domains. 

If the government says that certain domains must no longer be accessible, this is a form of censorship.

When the DNS server has no entry for a domain, it will return an NXDOMAIN respone. The government could therefore require ISPs to return NXDOMAIN responses for the domains that are forbidden. 

The DNS server operated by the ISP or by hackers could send the user to a page where adverts are shown, were statistics can be collected, or other things can be done.

There's also a different problem: Most web applications rely on the fact that they get an NXDOMAIN response for domains that do not exist. If they now get a valid page (for example with advertisments), this breaks the appliction.

One way to overcome this problem is to use Domain Name System Security Extensions, often shorened to DNSSec. DNSSec is an extennsion of DN which uses asymmetric cryptography, and digital signatures for DNS entries. In practice, this makes it impossible to change the entry of the DNS record.

ICANN, the international body responsible for administering top-level domain names, has published a memorandum highlighting its concerns, and affirming:

Cockneys vs Zombies

Cockneys vs Zombies is a British zombie apocalypse-comedy film produced by Limelight Molinare and co-Director

Domain Name System Security Extensions

The Domain Name System Security Extensions is a set of standards that add security features to the Domain Name System. Usually, it is called DNSSec. The domain name system stores information about internet domains. With DNSSec, it is possible to verify that the data provided is really the data that holder of the domain submitted. DNSSec was developed to fight against DNS hijacking. It uses digital signatures to protect the data. There's no authentication of server or client. DNSSec does not use encryption, as this is not needed.

Subordinationism

In the Christian religion, Subordinationism is a doctrine of the Trinity. It claims that the Son is subordinate to the Father because he is a created being, and because he has a created nature, he is not fully God as the Father is.

Subordinationism was rejected as heresy at the Council of Nicaea in 325. Subordination of the Spirit, which argued that the Spirit must not have been fully God because of his subordination to the Father and the Son, was a similar issue in 381 and was condemned as heresy in the second council of Constantinople. 

Subordinationism is different from Arianism. Subordinationism shares the Nicene-Constantinopolitan view. Unlike Subordinationism, Arianism believes that the Holy Spirit is not a person but rather a supernatural force, and that the Son was not always the Son from the beginning, that there was a time before the Son was begotten, and that the title "Son" was just a title he later assumed.

According to Badcock, theology experts were Subordinationists at some point. This includes people like Irenaeus, Tertullian, Hippolytus, Justin Martyr, and Novatian, they believed that God the Father is the only person of the Trinity who is fully God. Subordinationism can be found in Ascension of Isaiah. This was because they valued and admired the Father's supremacy; they believed that a fully divine Son would destroy his supremacy and that sharing this divine essence with more than one person would imply that God is both divisible and changeable. They argued that anyone other than the Father must have been created by the Father and be subordinate to him; they were convinced that the Son was a created being because he was subordinate to him.

Alexander and Arius had a disagreement that occurred during the Arian Controversy, which started in the year 318 or 319. At the beginning, no one knew the exact answer. Arius (c. 250–336), a priest of Alexandria, Egypt, had an argument with Alexander, who was the bishop of the church in that city, about his obvious carelessness in blurring the difference of nature between the Father and the Son, as he believed in the eternal Sonship of the Son (that the Son was always the Son since the beginning).
According to Socrates, Arius' view was:“If the Father begat the Son, that would mean that he who was begotten must have had a beginning of existence: and from this it is obvious, that there was a time when the Son "didn't". It therefore means that he [the Son] was created with no material but of nothing.”According to Kelly, the argument was over whether the Son had a beginning. To make their case, the parties relied on the Son's source of existence.To justify his view that the Son had no beginning, Alexander argued that the Son had been 'begotten' by the Father from his own being. But Arius argued that the Son was created out of nothing, and therefore had a beginning.While Alexander described the Son as being equal in nature and being to the Father, Arius described Him as being subordinate in nature and being to the Father.

Real-time Transport Protocol

The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a network protocol used to send audio and video over IP networks. RTP is used in communication and entertainment systems that use streaming media, such as telephony, video teleconference applications, television services and web-based push-to-talk features.

RTP normally runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It is used with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). While RTP carries the audio and video, RTCP monitors transmission statistics and quality of service (QoS). RTP is one of the basic technologies in the use of Voice over IP. It is often used with a signaling protocol such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) which creates connections across the network.

RTP was developed by the Audio-Video Transport Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It was first published in 1996 as . It was replaced by in 2003.

They consisted of a mix of various different social groups and different varnas (in the Dharma system, the (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishya and Shudras) including and tribes. Rajputization explains how such diverse communities merged into the Rajput community.

According to Harbans Singh Bhatia, It would appear that Brahmans, Bhars, Ahirs, Jats, Gujars, and Huns have all contributed to the Rajput clans.

The Chandel Rajputs were originally Hinduised Bhars or Gonds or both. When they became politically powerful, they became Kshatriyas or Rajputs. The Gaharwars similarly are associated with the Bhars, the Bundelas and the northern Rathors are offshoots of the Garhawars. The Dharmasastras recognise the possibility of lower castes being elevated to higher castes.

The Kachhwahas, is a celebrated Indian tribe, neither Rajput race nor Jat race by descent, but adopted into the Rajput.

O Come, All Ye Faithful

"O Come, All Ye Faithful" (in Latin: "Adeste Fideles") is a Christmas carol. 

It is not known who wrote the music and words. Many people thought that it was written in the 15th or 16th century. However, this is not true. It was first written down in the 18th century by John Francis Wade, an English Roman Catholic. The music may have been taken from the a French opera called "Le Comte d'Acajou". In the opera, there is an aria with a melody like the carol.

At first, the carol only had four stanzas. Later, four more stanzas were added.

Samuel Webbe published the carol in 1760. He translated the carol to English as "Draw Near, Ye Faithful Christians". Frederick Oakeley translated the carol as "O Come, All Ye Faithful" in 1841.

He was expedition leader of the expedition to the Caucasus Mountains in 1967 with four friends. It was in the Soviet Union during the Cold War and they were even followed by the police. It was a successful expedition, in which not only the mountain top of Elbrus was reached, but also the technically much more challenging north peak of Ushba (4698 meters) via the northern side.

He did an expedition to the Annapurna in 1977.

Plugge was expedition leader of the expedition to the Himalayas to climb the Mount Everest in 1982. The mountain top was never reached by a Dutch person. The expedition was a failure. They didn’t reached the top. Besides of that, television cameras recorded that they had many arguments. An argument over who had robbed a can of nuts became known. A second expedition to the Mount Everest was organized and led by Herman Plugge in 1984. they climbed this time the mountain from the side of Nepal. Bart Vos claimed to be the first Dutchman who reached the top. However, this ascent is no longer internationally being recognized.

Herman was an honorary member of the Dutch royal climbing federation (NKBV) and was awarded the NKBV Lifetime Achievement Award. He received the award for everything he did for the NKBV. Next to leading expeditions, he was a board member of the KNAV, organized training courses and led the Commission for Expeditions and Alpine Top Sport.

Abraham Accords

The Abraham Accords are a set of diplomatic documents between Israel, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Bahrain. They were signed on September 15, 2020 at the White House, with Donald Trump as a witness. It was first an agreement between Israel, and the UAE, but later Bahrain joined due to similar interests. The goal was to make diplomatic relations and trade easier between the countries. The focus was on improving peace and stability in the Middle East. 
Arab states and Israel began to normalize their relationship with the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty (1979) and the Jordan-Israel Peace Treaty (1994). In March 2002, the Arab League also agreed on the Arab Peace Initiative (API). The API is in favor of normalized relations with Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from the occupied territories of Palestine.
On June 12, 2020 Youseif Al-Otaiba, ambassador of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the United States, wrote a piece disagreeing with the Israeli annexation of the West Bank. Following the API, he thought of normalizing relations with Israel to put an end to the annexation. The United States agreed that it was a good solution and decided to supervise negotiations. On August 13, 2020 Donald Trump announced publicly that discussions were ongoing between Israel and the UAE. Following the announcement, Bahrain asked to participate in the exchanges with Israel. The negotiations ended on September 15, 2020 with the official signature of the Abraham Accords at the White House between the United States, Israel, the UAE and Bahrain.
The signatories of the declaration are the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (upper left), the American President Donald Trump (bottom left), the Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani (upper right) and the Emirati minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nayhan (bottom right).

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain share similar motivations for signing the accords. These include securing peace in the region, shared opposition toward Iran, and wanting improved relations with the United States (US) and Israel. Instability in the region refers to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has created divisions between Arab nations. The UAE and Bahrain claim that signing the accords will help improve stability due to potential free-trade and economic advantages. However, other members of the Arab League, such as Qatar and Kuwait, refuse to recognize Israel until the Palestinian issue is solved. The UAE, Bahrain and Israel were all opposed to the Iranian Nuclear Deal and sided with the US in fighting the Islamic regime. Donald Trump's role in mediating the agreements, opened doors for more economic and military support from the US to the UAE and Bahrain, particularly naval and aviation resources.

Donald Trump helped mediate the accords and signed the documents with representatives for Israel, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Bahrain. The accords were also signed at the White House. Facing re-election, Trump wanted to improve his role in international affairs and shares similar beliefs regarding the Iranian Nuclear Deal and the region's instability. His position also reflects the United State's allies, interests and complicated history in the region. 

Morocco signed a similar agreement with Israel on December 22, 2020. Sudan also declared a wish to normalize its relations with Israel. The other Gulf states did not follow suit. 

The Abraham Accords benefited Israel more than the other signatories. Even without annexing the West Bank, the state is able to establish new settlements. It didn't significantly impact the Palestinians. The signatories all gained trade and economic opportunities. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain won the support of the United States.

Wee Willie Winkie

"Wee Willie Winkie" is a Scottish nursery rhyme. The main character in the rhyme is well-known as a personification of sleep. The poem was written by William Miller and titled "Willie Winkie", first published in "Whistle-binkie: Stories for the Fireside" in 1841. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 13711.

The original text of 1841 in Scots, and a paraphrased version for English-language readers (from 1844) are below:

The poem was written by William Miller (1810–1872), first printed in "Whistle-binkie: Stories for the Fireside" in 1841 and re-printed in "Whistle-Binkie; a Collection of Songs for the Social Circle" published in 1873. In Jacobite songs Willie Winkie referred to King William III of England, one example being "The Last Will and Testament of Willie winkie" but it seems likely that Miller was simply using the name rather than writing a Jacobite satire.

Antinous

Antinous (; ; – ) was a young Greek man from Bithynia and a favourite and likely lover of the Roman emperor Hadrian. Following his death aged eighteen, Antinous was deified (made into a deity) on Hadrian's orders, being worshipped in both the Greek East and Latin West, sometimes as a god () and sometimes as a hero ().

Little is known of Antinous's life, although it is known that he was born in Claudiopolis (present day Bolu, Turkey), in the Roman province of Bithynia. He was probably introduced to Hadrian in 123, before being taken to Italy for a higher education. He had become the favourite of Hadrian by 128, when he was taken on a tour of the Roman Empire as part a group of people accompanying Hadrian. Antinous accompanied Hadrian when he attended the yearly Eleusinian Mysteries religious rites in Athens, and was with him when he killed the Marousian lion in Libya, an event highly publicised by the Emperor. In October 130, as they were part of a flotilla (group of small warships) going along the Nile, Antinous died amid mysterious circumstances. A number of suggestions have been put forward for how he died, ranging from an accidental drowning to an intentional human sacrifice or suicide.

After his death, Hadrian deified Antinous and founded an organised cult devoted to his worship that spread throughout the Roman Empire. Hadrian founded the city of Antinoöpolis close to Antinous's place of death, which became a cultic centre for the worship of Osiris-Antinous. Hadrian also founded games in commemoration of Antinous to take place in both Antinoöpolis and Athens, with Antinous becoming a symbol of Hadrian's dreams of pan-Hellenism. The worship of Antinous proved to be one of the most enduring and popular of cults of deified humans in the Roman Empire, and events continued to be founded in his honour long after Hadrian's death. 

Antinous became a symbol of male homosexuality in Western culture, appearing in the work of Oscar Wilde and Fernando Pessoa.


Sura Kingdom

The Sura (Abhira) Kingdom is mentioned as one of the kingdoms or provinces of ancient India (Bharata Varsha) as per the epic Mahabharata. The Suras were a subdivision of the Haihayas. They were mentioned along with another tribe called the Abhiras along the banks of Saraswati River where it dried up in the desert. They were dominated by the Abhiras, sometimes referred to as Surabhira The Balarama visited this place during his pilgrimage along the partially dried up river Saraswati. After this place, only a dried up river bed existed and the desert or the "Maru" region began. According to Mahābhārata (IX.36.) Sura lived in the region of Vinasana, in the vicinity of Abhiras (tato vinaśanam rājanājagāma halāyudhaḥ śūrābhirān prati dveṣād yatra naṣṭā sarasvatī).

The Suras and Abhiras' are associated together in the Mahabharata and Harivansa and appear to have been a pastoral people in the upper portion of the North-western Punjab represented by the Ahirs and Gwalas of the present day.

There are the Sura-abhiras, the Dardas, the Kasmiras, and the Pattis; the Kshatriyas; the Atreyas, the Bharadwajas, the Stanaposhikas, the Poshakas, the Kalingas, and diverse tribes of Kiratas; the Tomaras, the Hansamargas, and the Karamanjakas among the kingdoms of Bharata Varsha (6:9).

Nakula brought under subjection the mighty Gramaniya that dwelt on the shore of the sea, and the Suras and the Abhiras that dwelt on the banks of the Saraswati, and all those tribes that lived upon fisheries, and those also that dwelt on the mountains, and the whole of the country called after the five rivers, and the mountains called Amara, and the country called Uttarayotisha and the city of Divyakutta and the tribe called Dwarapala (2:31).

In India a brahman is the major god, or spirit.

Bala Rama proceeded to Vinasana where the Saraswati hath become invisible in consequence of her contempt for Suras and Abhiras. And since the Sarasvati, in consequence of such contempt, is lost at that spot, the "Rishis", for that reason, always name the place as Vinasana (9:37). "The allegations on Suras for the drying up of the river could be latter interpretations. However the mention of the drying up of river Saraswati close to the Sura-Abhira kingdoms has great geogrhapical and geological significance."

The Sura kings that dwelt in the regions on the seacoast, brought with them hundred thousands of serving girls of the Karpasika country, all of beautiful features and luxuriant hair and decked in golden ornaments; and also many skins of the Ranku deer as tribute unto king Yudhishthira (2:50).

The Madras, the Trigartas the Amvashthas, the Westerners, the Northerners, the Malavas, the Surasenas, the Suras the Maladas, the Sauviras, the Kaitavas, the Easterners, and the Southerners placing Duryodhana and Karna at their head, forming the rear guard, gladdened warriors of their own army (7:7). The Kalingas, the Singhalas, the Easterners, the Suras, the Abhiras, the D3aserakas, the Sakas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas, the Hangsapadas, the Surasenas, the Daradas, the Madras, and the Kalikeyas, with hundreds and thousands of elephants, steeds, cars, and foot-soldiers were stationed at the neck of the Kauravabattle-array (7:20).

Gautama Dirghatamas of rigid vows begat on the Sura woman Ausinari (the daughter of king Usinara) Kakshivat and other celebrated sons (2:21, 12:172). These sons later became the kings of Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Pundra and Suhma.

King Devaka had a daughter endowed with youth and beauty and begotten upon a Sura wife. Bringing her from her father's abode, Bhishma married her to Vidura of great wisdom. And Vidura begot upon her many children like unto himself in accomplishments (1:114).

Battle of Svatove

The Battle of Svatove is a current battle between Russia and Ukraine over the eastern Ukrainian city of Svatove. It is part of the Russo-Ukrainian War and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and part of the Battle of the Svatove-Kreminna line. The battle began on October 3, 2022, a day after the Ukrainian army recaptured the town of Lyman in Donetsk Oblast.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Svatove was occupied by Russian and Luhansk People's Republic forces on 6 March 2022. In early September 2022, it was reported that Russian forces were leaving the city. This was because of a Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast. However, Russian troops had came back by 14 September. After Putin announced partial mobilization on 21 September, some of the newly recruited conscripts were sent to Svatove to the front line after only 2 days of training at most to counter Ukrainian advances.

Russian forces mined all roads leading to Svatove and Kreminna to defeat Ukrainian advances.

After the Ukrainian recapture of Lyman on October 2, Ukrainian forces went towards the Kharkiv-Luhansk oblast borders. On October 3, they took back Borova and the nearby town of Shyikivka. To the south, Ukraine took back the villages of Izyumske and Druzhelyubivka on the border of Kharkiv and Luhansk oblasts. 

To the north of Borova, Ukrainian forces took back Bohuslavka and Borivska Andriivka. To the east, Ukrainian forces also took Hrekivka and Makiivka. On October 9, Ukrainian forces took back Kruhlyakivka.

Between October 9 and 13, Ukrainian forces made small advances into Luhansk Oblast. They took back the villages of Novolyubivka, Nevske, Novoiehorivka, Nadiia, and Andriivka, all southwest of Svatove. In the north, Ukrainian forces took back Krokhmalne.

By October 24, Ukrainian forces had taken back Kamazynivka, Myasozharivka, and Nevske in Luhansk Oblast, and Novosadove in Donetsk Oblast.

On the night of 2 November, Ukrainian sources claimed to have destroyed an entire Russian battalion near the town of Makiivka, in Svatove Raion. 

The offensive and battle slowed down during November, but it still continues.

National anthem of Scotland

As Scotland is part of the United Kingdom, the British national song "God Save the King" is used in Scotland on royal occasions, for example, or when Scottish athletes participate at the Olympics. However, in other situations, other songs are used as "acutual" Scottish songs, especially "Flower of Scotland" and "Scotland the Brave". There have been calls for Scotland to have its own official national song.

In 2004, lawyers for the devolved Scottish Parliament advised that it was within the legal smart ability of the Scottish Parliament to choose a national song for Scotland, going against the suggestion that it would be a matter reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. This ruling caused some interest in the idea, and a petition to the Scottish Parliament's petitions committee supported by the Scottish Green Party was referred without recommendation to the Scottish Executive, but they decided to take no action, thinking about the issue not to be a political priority. There have been subsequent attempts to re-open the debate on a national anthem for Scotland.

In 2006, the Scottish Parliament Enterprise Committee denied a formal request from Scottish National Party MSP Michael Matheson on the subject.

At most international sporting events Scotland uses "Flower of Scotland" as its national song. These events include matches of the Scottish national football team, Scottish cricket team and the Scottish rugby union team. The song has also been used as the victory song of Scotland at the Commonwealth Games since 2010, replacing "Scotland the Brave".

In June 2006 the Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted an online opinion poll on their website, asking visitors to choose a favourite to be Scotland's national song. With over 10,000 votes cast, "Flower of Scotland" came first with 41% of the votes, followed by "Scotland the Brave" with 29%.

Other songs which have been suggested include Robert Burns' "Auld Lang Syne", and Hamish Henderson's "Freedom Come-All-Ye". Both of these songs, from the 18th and 20th centuries respectively, are written in Lowland Scots.

Babruysk

Babruysk, Babrujsk, Bobruisk, or Bobruysk ( , Łacinka: , , ) is a city in the Mogilev Region of eastern Belarus. It is on the Berezina River. , its population was 209,675. It is the seventh-largest city in Belarus by population and area.

The name Babruysk (as well as that of the Babruyka River) probably comes from the Belarusian word (; 'beaver'). Many beavers used to live around the Berezina. However, they were almost gone by the end of the 19th century because of hunting and pollution.

Babruysk has an area of . It has over 450 streets.

Babruysk is at the intersection of railroads to Asipovichy, Zhlobin, Aktsyabrski and roads to Minsk, Homyel, Mahilyow, Kalinkavichy, Slutsk, and Rahachow. It has the biggest timber mill in Belarus. It is also known for its chemical, machine making and metal-working industries.

In 2021, there were 38 public schools in Babruysk, and over 24,000 students. There are three schools focusing on music, dance and visual arts. There is also a medical school.

Babruysk is one of the oldest cities in Belarus. It was first mentioned in writing in the middle of the 14th century. Archaeologists found that in the 5th and 6th centuries there were Slavic settlements up the river Berezina from where Babruysk is right now. Stone tools and weapons found suggest that people have lived there since the Stone Age.

During the reign of Vladimir I, Prince of Kiev, Babruysk was a small village. The people of the town were fishermen and beaver trappers. This is where the name Babruysk comes from. Babruysk was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth for many centuries. It was an important border post and military base. In the 14th century, a castle was built on one of the hills near the Berezina River.

Babruysk was also a big trade center. There is evidence of a market with almost one hundred stalls. In the first half of the 17th century, Babruysk became a big trade outpost. This is because of its position at the intersection of major trade routes and the Berezina River. There were many types of artisans in the village, including carpenters, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, and bakers. The population in the first half of the 17th century was between 2,000 and 5,000 people.

The town was surrounded by fortifications made from wood and dirt. It stretched for over . In the walls there were openings for firearms. After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, the village went into the hands of Imperial Russia. In 1810, the construction of a fortress to mark the border between Russia and Austria and Prussia began. In 1812, it was almost done and was successful in pushing back Napoleon's attack for four months. The building was rebuilt on a large scale after the war. It was finished in 1820. The Babruysk fortress worked well for many decades and today is a major tourist attraction.

The 1861 census said the town had a population of 15,766. The ethnic groups living in Babruysk then included Belarusians, Ukrainians, Poles, and Jews. Most of the buildings were made from wood. This was common for cities in Belarus at the time. In 1866, there were 1,498 houses. Only 29 of these were made from brick.

The Jewish population of Babruysk went up after the Napoleonic Wars. By 1897, 20,760 of the 34,336 people living in the city were Jews. This was about 60% of the population. Most of them were employed in crafts, industry, and trade.

In 1902, the Great Fire of Babruysk left 2,500 families homeless and destroyed over 250 businesses, 15 schools, and the market. There were more than 7 million rubles in property damage. However, the city was quickly rebuilt. This time, it was built with brick and stone.

In 1904, the 40th Infantry Division of the Imperial Russian Army had its headquarters here.

During the Russian Civil War, the Red Army fought the Polish I Corps in Russia in Babruysk. This was known as the Battle of Bobruysk. It was fought between February 2 and March 11, 1918. The Polish troops, commanded by General Jozef Dowbor-Musnicki, eventually took the town.

On 28 June 1941, troops of the German Army Group Centre took Babruysk. Thinking that the German troops would not attack civilians, many Jews stayed behind. Because of this, 20,000 Babruysk Jews were shot and buried in mass graves. A ghetto and labor camps were set up in the southwest part of town. Soon the Nazis began executing the Jews in the ghetto in groups of about 30. By 1943, the labor camps were cleared of Jews. The Jews who escaped joined partisan forces in the nearby forest. They attacked enemy railroad lines. There is a small memorial dedicated to the memory of Babruysk Jews killed in the Holocaust. It is in the Nahalat Yitzhak cemetery, Giv'atayim, Israel, as part of the Babi Yar memorial.

In July 1941, a battle started near Babruysk. This became part of the Battle of Smolensk.

On June 29, 1944, the Red Army took Babruysk back. The city was ruined. The population was 84,107 in 1939. After the war, it was 28,352. Thousands of workers and prisoners of war worked to clear the factories and streets of rubble. They filled in craters made by the bombardment. The machine building factory had been almost completely destroyed. It was fixed and started working again by the end of 1944.

In 1944, Babruysk Voblast was created. Babruysk became the administrative center of the voblast. The voblast was abolished in 1954.

The population grew a lot after the war. In 1959 it was 96,000, 116,000 in 1965, 122,500 in 1968, 136,000 in 1970, and 232,000 in 1989. This was mostly because of urbanization. Many people moved into the city from the nearby rural areas.

Belarus left the Soviet Union in 1991. Babruysk became part of the new country. 

Babruysk has a humid continental climate (Dfb) in the Köppen climate classification system.

Kural

The Tirukkuṟaḷ (), or shortly the Kural (), is a classic Tamil language text. It has 1,330 short couplets (two-line poem parts), or kurals, of seven words each. 

The text is divided into three books with aphorisms (sayings) on virtue ("aram"), wealth ("porul") and love ("inbam"). It is thought as one of the greatest works ever written on ethics and morality. It is also known for its all-inclusiveness and secular nature. 

People say Valluvar (full name Thiruvalluvar) wrote the work. The text has been dated from 300 BCE to the 5th century CE. The usual accounts describe it as the last work of the third Sangam (before 300 CE). Although language-based analysis suggests a later date of 450 to 500 CE and that it was composed after the Sangam period.

The Kural text is among the earliest systems of Indian epistemology (way of thinking of knowledge) and metaphysics (way of thinking of reality and being). The Kural is traditionally praised with epithets such as "the Tamil Veda" and "the Divine Book". 

Written on the ideas of "ahimsa" (non-violence), it draws attention to non-violence and moral vegetarianism as good things for a person to do. Also, it highlights truthfulness, controlling your emotions and reactions, thankfulness, hospitality, kindness, goodness of one's wife, duty, giving, and so forth, besides covering a wide range of social and political topics such as kings, ministers, taxes, justice, forts, war, greatness of armies and soldier's honor, death sentence for the wicked, agriculture, education, not drinking alcohol and things that make people drunk or high. It also includes chapters on friendship, love, sexual unions, and home life. The text permanently redefined the cultural values of the Tamil land.

The Kural has been liked and respected by experts from ethical, social, political, economic, religious, philosophical, and spiritual fields. These include Ilango Adigal, Kambar, Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Albert Schweitzer, Ramalinga Swamigal, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai, Karl Graul, George Uglow Pope, Alexander Piatigorsky, and Yu Hsi. The work remains the most translated, the most referred-to, and the most cited of Tamil literary works. 

The text has been translated into at least 40 languages. This made it one of the most translated ancient works. Ever since it came to print for the first time in 1812, the Kural text has never been out of print. Its author is praised for selecting the best virtues found in the known books and showing them in an manner that most people understand. The Tamil people and the government of Tamil Nadu have long revered and celebrated the text.

Protocol stack

A protocol stack is a part of an operating system (OS) or device that is used to communicate with other things. 

Computers communicate in many ways. A mobile phone contains several protocol stacks. There are protocol stack for handling voice calls, Bluetooth and USB. There is often a protocol stack that is used when reading a webpage on Wikipedia. There are many other stacks that are used by phones.

Sometimes the protocol stacks work together. An example of this is when a person uses a Bluetooth headset for a voice call. One stack is used for the phone to communicate with the headset. Another stack is used to make the voice call. The Bluetooth headset has its own bluetooth protocol stack. 

The protocol stacks are used to send and receive information.

Each layer of the protocol stack handles a different part of the communication. There is a protocol stack with many different layers that are used to send data. Other layers are used to receive date. Often the data us sent and received at the same time. When two things communicate with each other in a standard manner, this is known as a protocol.

Some layers within the protocol stack will work on "reliability." They will send a message again if the first message was lost in communication. Some layers will provide "compatibility." They will let data to be communicated in different ways. They also let different types of data to be communicated in a standard manner. Layers often handle a series of chunks of data. Some layers split the data into smaller chunks when sending it. This is called "fragmentation." When the data is received, another layer puts the smaller chunks back together to form larger chunks or media streams. This is called "reassembly". Some layers may encrypt the data when it is sent. This is done so it cannot be read. A layer at the receiving side will remove the encryption.

The OSI model is a common way to think about protocol stacks.

While in the eleventh grade, he met and was mentored by Greg Curtis (who produced and co-wrote Keyshia Cole's 2006 hit "Love"). From Curtis, who had a studio in Houston, Cox learned the basic fundamentals of creating songs, including production, using audio equipment, recording, as well as songwriting and structuring.

During his senior year, he was joined at the school by singer Beyoncé and her former Destiny's Child group member LeToya Luckett. His friendship with Beyoncé and her belief in his talent resulted in his first "real" recording session, which consisted of doing three demo songs for the group then known only as "Destiny." Although the songs were never officially released, Cox expressed that the session really led him to know that he wanted to be a professional music producer.

In 1997, he moved to Atlanta to attend Clark Atlanta University (CAU), where he majored in music. However, the mean reason for his move was to get into the music industry. He looked for opportunities within the music industry. Based on information from a campus brochure, he sought out and obtained an unpaid internship with the Noontime production company, to gain experience and opportunities. His hard work paid off as his affiliation with Noontime led him to work with Jagged Edge, which led to him meeting Jermaine Dupri. Cox's relationship with Dupri soon led to producing and writing for Nivea, Monica, Da Brat and Lil' Bow Wow. Though Cox has since co-written and co-produced an extensive body of work (including Hot 100 #1 hits such as Mariah Carey's "Don't Forget About Us" plus Usher's "Burn," "Confessions, Pt. 2" and "U Got It Bad") and won two Grammy awards (for his work on albums by Carey and Usher), Mary J. Blige's "Be Without You" marked his first Hot 100 Top 5 hit without Dupri.

Poverty porn

Poverty porn, pornography of poverty, development porn, famine porn, or stereotype porn, is a type of media that uses a place's bad conditions. The bad conditions create sympathy and this sympathy can then be used to get money. This money will then go to charities or another type of cause. Poverty porn is also a word that can be used to criticize movies that objectify people in poverty for the sake of entertaining a watcher.

In western culture, "poverty porn" is often used in politics as well. Some political parties may use it as a way to purposefully make misleading impressions of the lives of the poor. Other political parties use this term as the result of the welfare state.

Poverty porn is often used modern pop culture. The idea of poverty porn has become popular in many movies and TV shows.

The British television program "The Hardest Grafter" uses Poverty Porn this when it shows 25 of Britain's "poorest workers,". All of these workers have the shared objective of winning £15,000. They win this money through doing different tasks. Some sources say that this television show can be perverted and discriminatory. This is because the members of the show can only be poor.

Lignite

Lignite, often called brown coal, is a soft sedimentary rock. It is brown in color and combustible. The rock is created from naturally compressed peat. It has a carbon content around 25–35%. It is thought to be the lowest rank of coal. This is because of its low heat content. Lignite has a high amount of moisture when it is taken from the ground. This can explain its low carbon content. The rock is mined all around the world. It is mostly used as a fuel for steam-electric power generation.

The combustion of lignite makes less heat for the amount of carbon dioxide and sulfur that come out than other types of coal. Because of this, environmentalists have said that lignite is the worst coal for human health. Many different toxic heavy metals can also be in lignite. These are left over in the coal fly ash made from its combustion. This causes more health risks.

Most lignite is used to make electricity. It is also used in agriculture, in industry, and, as jet, in jewelry.

The song got positive reviews from critics. They praised the production, lyrics, and vocals. Because of high usage on many commercials and trailers, the song became a sleeper hit. It got to number three on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and became the band's first top 10 single. It was also the third best selling song in the United States in 2013.

The song is an electronic rock and alternative rock song with parts of dubstep. The song's lyrics have apocalyptic and revolutionist themes. Examples for these themes from the lyrics are: 'I'm waking up to ash and dust' and 'This is it, the apocalypse'. Though the band has publicly kept its secularity, NPR music critic Ann Powers has said that the song has strong "religious or spiritual imagery". This imagery has, however, been common throughout the history of rock music.

Speaking on the song, lead singer Dan Reynolds said:
The song is written in the key of B dorian. This is a mode of A major in which B is used as the tonic note.

"Radioactive" was released to positive reviews. "AbsolutePunk" gave it a positive review, saying that the acoustic part of the song was "haunting". They also said the chorus was "hypnotizing". Dara Hickey of "Unreality Shout" also reviewed it positively. She said the song was the "darkest moment" on the album. She also said that, like all the other songs on the album, "Radioactive" was successful in creating a sound that "never fails to take off and send fists skyward". IGN said that the song was "strangely intense and abrasive". They said that "Radioactive" was "perhaps the greatest calling card of Imagine Dragons".

"Crave Online" said the song was an "opening throb", saying that the song "sexes up the dub-flirtation with a verse hingeing on the line 'this is it, the apocalypse' and a triumphant chorus, with more than a few shades of Hip-Hop in the production", and that the song was as "radio-ready as they come". "Our Vinyl" said that the "power of this song is outstanding with heavy drums and more of an electronic feel than the rest of the album and strong, impressive vocals from front-man Dan Reynolds which are reciprocated throughout the LP." Jon Dolan of "Rolling Stone" was critical of the song, saying it was "a dour moaner that sound[s] like Chris Martin trying to write an Eminem ballad about the end of the world."

In 2018, "Billboard" ranked the song number two and "Louder Sound" number one on their lists of the 10 greatest Imagine Dragons songs.

It is also on the soundtrack for NBA 2K14, the first NBA 2K game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

Other countries that produced such movies include Brazil, Italy, and Mexico. 

The ancient Greek theatre genre of the satyr play contained farcical sex. Perhaps the best-known ancient comedy motivated by sexual gamesmanship is Aristophanes' "Lysistrata" (411 BC). In Lysistrata, the title character persuades her fellow women of Greece to protest against the Peloponnesian War by not having sex. The "boy-meets-girl" plot that is distinctive of Western sexual comedy can be traced to Menander (343–291 BC), who differs from Aristophanes in focusing on the courtship and marital dilemmas of the middle classes rather than social and political satire.

His successor Plautus, the Roman playwright whose comedies inspired the musical "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum", regularly based his plots on sexual situations. The popularity of Plautus's comedies was a major influence on the creation of situation sex comedy.

Move Like This

Move Like This is the seventh and final album by American rock band The Cars, released on May 10, 2011 by Concord Music Group. The album featured all of the original band members except for bassist and vocalist Benjamin Orr, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2000.

The first single from the album, "Sad Song", was released in mid-March. Other songs in the album include "Blue Tip" and "Free". FMQB described "Free" as a "return to the classic Cars sound that fans know and love."

According to "Billboard" magazine, the album was recorded in engineer Paul Orofino's home studio in Millbrook, New York. The Cars did not add a new bassist to the line-up to replace Orr; instead, keyboardist Greg Hawkes programmed or performed all of the bass parts on the album.

"Move Like This" makes the first Cars reunion to feature vocalist Ric Ocasek since their 1988 split. In 1997, Ocasek was quoted as saying the band would "never" reunite. A partial reunion of the band occurred in 2005 when Hawkes and lead guitarist Elliot Easton toured with singer Todd Rundgren as "The New Cars"; neither Ocasek nor Cars drummer David Robinson participated, and Rundgren's line-up broke up after two years of touring.

This was the last appearance by Ric Ocasek before his death on 15 September 2019. 
In April 2011, the band announced a North American tour to promote the album. The eleven-city tour kicked off May 10 in Seattle and wrapped up May 26 at the House of Blues in Boston. The performances and track listings received mixed reviews: "Hollywood Reporter" reviewer Erik Pedersen found "Move Like This" to be a "surprisingly good" album but described the May 12 Hollywood Palladium show as "icy" and unenthusiastic. "San Jose Mercury News" reviewer Jim Harrington described the band's performance at Oakland's Fox Theater as "incredibly flat and dispassionate", but praised the band's "solid" musicianship.

Songs performed on the tour include the "Move Like This" tracks "Blue Tip", "Keep on Knocking", "Sad Song", "Free", "Drag on Forever" and "Hits Me", as well as material from the band '70s and '80s albums. On tour, Orr's bass parts were performed by Hawkes on keyboard and bass; the vocals on songs originally sung by Orr ("Just What I Needed", "Let's Go" and "Moving in Stereo") were performed by Ocasek.

This enhanced CD also has videos for "Sad Song" and "Blue Tip". "Rocket USA" is a cover of a 1977 song by the American band Suicide, from their self-titled debut.

"I'm Not the One" is the original 1980 album version, while the "Greatest Hits" was a 1986 remix. "Greatest Hits" also includes "Heartbeat City," which is not included on "Just What I Needed."
The next three songs were B-sides that had never been released on CD before:

The next 4 tracks were recorded as demos in 1977. "Leave or Stay" and "Ta Ta Wayo Wayo" were eventually re-recorded for the band's 1987 "Door to Door" album; the other 2 tracks were never re-recorded. All 4 tracks were previously unreleased recordings.
The next unreleased track is an unfinished outtake from the band's first album, featuring only Ocasek & Hawkes. It was eventually re-recorded for 1979's "Candy-O".
The previously unreleased "Slipaway" was recorded as a 24-track demo by The Cars between their first and second albums. Rather than record a finished studio version, The Cars gave the song to Ian Lloyd, who published his version later in 1979.

James Wilkinson

James Wilkinson (March 24, 1757 – December 28, 1825) was an American soldier, politician, and double agent who was connected with several scandals and controversies.
He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, but he was forced twice to quit. He was twice the Senior Officer of the U.S. Army, selected to be the first Governor of the Louisiana Territory in 1805, and commanded two unsuccessful campaigns in the St. Lawrence River theater during the War of 1812. He died while posted as a peacekeeper in Mexico City.

In 1854, following long archival research in the Spanish archives in Madrid, Louisiana historian Charles Gayarré exposed Wilkinson as having been a highly paid spy in the service of the Spanish Empire. In the years since Gayarré's research became public, Wilkinson has been terribly strongly criticized by American historians and politicians. According to President Theodore Roosevelt, "In all our history, there is no more despicable character." However, he has been defended, especially in breaking up the Burr conspiracy.
James Wilkinson was born on March 24, 1757, the son of Joseph Wilkinson and Alethea (Heighe) Wilkinson. Wilkinson's birthplace was about three miles (5 km) northeast of Benedict, Charles County, Maryland, on a farm south of Hunting Creek in Calvert County. 

Wilkinson's grandfather had been good enough rich to buy a large property known as Stoakley Manor in Calvert County. Even though James Wilkinson's family lived on a smaller estate than those of Maryland's elite, they still saw themselves as members of the higher social class. According to historian Andro Linklater, Wilkinson grew up with the idea that "the image of respectability excused the reality of betrayal". His father received Stoakley Manor but by then the family was in debt. Joseph Wilkinson died in 1763, and in 1764 Stoakley Manor was broken up and sold. Wilkinson's older brother Joseph received what was left of the manor property after his father died. As the second son, James Wilkinson received no land.

Wilkinson's father had left him with the last words of "My son, if you ever put up with an insult, I will disinherit you." Biographer Andro Linklater argued that this upbringing led to Wilkinson's aggressive reaction toward perceived insults. Wilkinson's early education by a private teacher was given money by his mother-based grandmother. His study of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, also was given money by his grandmother, was interrupted by the American Revolutionary War.

Wilkinson married Ann Biddle (1742–1807) of the well-known Biddle family of Philadelphia on November 12, 1778, in Philadelphia. She was a first cousin of Charles Biddle, an business partner of Aaron Burr, and Wilkinson's marriage to the energetic Biddle helped his career as a politician and general. She died on February 23, 1807.

The couple had four sons: John (1780–1796), James Biddle (c. 1783–1813), Joseph Biddle (1789–1865), and Walter (born 1791). James and Walter both served as Captains in the US Army. 

On March 5, 1810, Wilkinson married Celestine Laveau Trudeau, widow of Thomas Urquhart and daughter of Charles Laveau Trudeau. They were the parents of twin girls Marie Isabel and Elizabeth Stephanie. Celestine's father, known in Louisiana as Don Carlos Trudeau, had served in the Spanish government of New Orleans. When the United States gained control of the city, he remained in New Orleans and made english-sounding his name.

Marie Isabel Wilkinson died in infancy. Elizabeth Stephanie Wilkinson (1816-1871) married Professor Toussaint Francois Bigot (1794-1869) in 1833.

Wilkinson first served in Thompson's Pennsylvania rifle military unit, 1775 to 1776, and was put into use as a captain in September 1775. He served as an assistant to Nathanael Greene during the Siege (attack) of Boston, participated in the placing of guns on the Dorchester Heights in March 1776, and following the British abandonment of Boston, went with the rest of the Continental Army to New York where he left Greene's staff and was given command of an infantry company.

Sent to Canada as part of the reinforcements for Benedict Arnold's army attacking Quebec, he arrived just in time to see the arrival of 8,000 British reinforcements under General John Burgoyne – which caused the collapse of the American effort in Canada. He became assitant to Arnold just before to the final retreat and left Canada with Arnold on the very last boat out. Shortly after that, he left Arnold's service and became an assitant to General Horatio Gates in August 1776.

When Gates sent him to Congress with official messages about the victory at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, Wilkinson kept the Continental Congress waiting while he attended to personal affairs. When he finally showed up, he added to his own role in the victory, and was brevetted as a brigadier general (despite being only 20 years old at the time) on November 6, 1777, and selected to the newly created Board of War. The promotion over more senior colonels caused a bunch of angry people yelling among Continental officers, especially because Wilkinson's gossiping seemed to show that he was a participant in the Conway Cabal, a conspiracy to replace George Washington with Horatio Gates as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. Gates soon had enough of Wilkinson, and the young officer was forced to quit in March 1778. On July 29, 1779, Congress selected him as the clothier-general of the Army, but he quit on March 27, 1781, due to his "lack of ability for the job".

Consumerism

With the Industrial Revolution, companies started to produce more goods that they would be able to sell. Overproduction occurs when there is more supply of a good than there is demand for it. Manufacturers use concepts such a planned obsolescence and advertising to manipulate consumer spending. Consumerism is a concept to counter this: it tells people to buy more and more goods. 

In 1899, Thorstein Veblen published a book on consumerism, called "The Theory of the Leisure Class". In the book, Veblen looked at the widespread values and economic institutions which started with the widespread "leisure time" in the beginning of the 20th century. He also introduces the concepts of conspicuous and vicarious consumption and waste. All are related to display of status, and not on how useful or functional something is. Today, these kinds of goods are known as Veblen goods. 

In economics, consumerism is used for economic policies that say that consumption is important. Consumers can choose freely what products they buy. Manufacturers should focus on the goods people want (and buy). Society should be organized accordingly. 

People who prefer a simple life (sometimes called a slow life) and people who look at the effects of capitalism have criticized the concept of consumerism. Experts often say that there are physical limits to consumerism. An economy cannot grow without bounds; overconsumption is also a problem. Both have a direct impact on the environment, such as overexploitation of natural resources, or the increase in waste. Larger effects include climate change. Some research that criticizes the concept, says that consumerism also has an effect on society as a whole: it makes class barriers stronger, and increases inequalities. 

Heraclius

Heraclius (; c. 575 – 11 February 641), was Eastern Roman emperor from 610 to 641. His rise to power began in 608, when he and his father, Heraclius the Elder, the exarch of Africa, led a revolt against Phocas, an unpopular emperor. Later in Heraclius' reign officialy used "Basileus" partially replacing the traditional "Imperator, Caesar and Augustus". He placed Greek as the official languange of the Eastern Roman Empire in place of Latin and even promoting Greek Culture but nevertheless had kept much of ancient roman traditions.

Heraclius's rule was marked by a number of military campaigns. The year Heraclius came to power, the empire was threatened on many sides. Heraclius immediately took charge of the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. The first fights of the campaign ended in defeat for the Byzantines; the Persian army fought their way to the Bosphorus but Constantinople was protected by unbreakable walls and a strong navy, and Heraclius was able to avoid total defeat. Soon after, he started changes to rebuild and strengthen the military. Heraclius drove the Persians out of Asia Minor and pushed deep into their territory, defeating them clearly in 627 at the Battle of Nineveh. The Persian king Khosrow II was overthrown and executed by his son Kavad II, who soon for a peace treaty, agreeing to withdraw from all occupied territory. This way diplomatic relations were restored.

However, Heraclius soon lost many of his newly regained lands to the Rashidun Caliphate. Newly appearing from the Arabian Peninsula, the Muslims quickly won the Sasanian Empire by force. In 636, the Muslims marched into Roman Syria, defeating Heraclius's brother Theodore. Within a short period of time, the Arabs conquered Mesopotamia, Armenia and Egypt. Heraclius responded with changes which let his successors fight the Arabs and avoid total destruction.

Heraclius entered diplomatic relations with the Croats and Serbs in the Balkans. He tried to repair the schism in the Christian church in regard to the Monophysites, by promoting a compromise doctrine called Monothelitism. The Church of the East (commonly called Nestorian) was also involved in the process. Eventually this project of togetherness was rejected by all sides of the argument.

Additive color

Additive color or additive mixing is a property of a color model. It predicts the appearance of colors made by happening together part lights, i.e. the perceived color can be predicted by summing the number-based representations of the part-related colors. Modern recipes of Grassmann's laws describe the additivity in the color perception of light mixtures in terms of algebraic equations. Additive color predicts perception and not any sort of change in the photons of light themselves. These predictions are only related in the limited scope of color matching experiments where viewers match small patches of uniform color isolated against a grey or black background.

The combination of two of the common three additive primary colors in equal proportions produces an additive secondary color—cyan, magenta or yellow. Additive color is also used to predict colors from overlapping projected colored lights often used in theater-based lighting for plays, concerts, circus shows, and night clubs.
