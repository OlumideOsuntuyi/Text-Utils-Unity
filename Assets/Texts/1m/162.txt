Serena (Pokémon)

Although Serena shares a similar background with other female characters in the Pokémon video game series, she received a positive reception for her appearance in the anime. she was well-received for her appearance in the anime. She gained fame for showing romantic feelings towards Ash Ketchum during the "Pokémon XY" anime series, which was evident through her blushing and getting flustered whenever she saw, talked to, or was close to Ash. However, this portrayal received criticism for being too exaggerated and not entirely suitable for the target audience of the Pokémon anime, which is children. The scene where Serena kisses Ash in the final episode of "Pokémon XYZ" became one of the favorite kissing scenes among anime fans in Japan.

Serena character was designed by Ken Sugimori and Atsuko Nishida for the video game series. While the anime and movie was designed by Toshihito Hirooka, and for manga by Satoshi Yamamoto. Her name comes from the French word "serein", meaning "calm" or "peaceful".

Serena's voice actor is Mayuki Makiguchi for Japanese, and Haven Paschall for English.

Serena first appears in "Pokémon X and Y" as a playable character if the player chooses, and also as a rival if player chooses a male character, Calem.

In "Pokémon Masters EX", she appears as a Pokemon Trainer and forms a sync pair with Fennekin and its evolutions Braixen and Delphox. She also appears alongside Calem as a Pokémon Trainer trophy in "Super Smash Bros."

Serena first appeared in "'s" episode "Kalos, Where Dreams and Adventures Begin!" It is known that she already knew each other with Ash Ketchum when they both attended Professor Oak's summer camp in Pallet Town. During the event, Serena lost her way and fell in the forest before being helped by Ash. Since then, she has had a crush on Ash and when Ash arrived at Kalos, her original intention was to return the handkerchief he had used to bandage her wound. Serena then chose to make a career as a Pokemon Performer after attending Sycamore summer camp. She has a dream to become a Kalos Queen. After Ash finished the event in the Kalos League, Serena then decided to continue her career by going to Hoenn. Before parting, she gave Ash a kiss as well as revealing her feelings that were stored all this time.

Serena is back in a cameo appearance in "". She encouraged Chloe to attend the Lilycove City Pokémon Contest. Just before Ash, Chloe, and Goh departed for Vermillion City, she briefly reunited with Ash where they both shared their respective goals to each other. She also promised to support Ash in World Coordination Series.

In "Pokémon Adventures" chapter X & Y, a female character named Y or Yvonne Gabena is loosely based on Serena.

Serena appeared in "Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction" and "Hoopa and the Clash of Ages" manga, serving the same role as in the respective movies they were based on.

She appeared in "Pokémon Evolutions" anime web series on episode "The Visionary".

Serena got different opinions about her appearance in the "Pokémon X and Y" video games. Writers like Tom Hoggins from "The Telegraph" and Griffin McElroy from "Polygon" said that the main characters in "X and Y" seemed "stiff, flat, and predictable" because they followed the usual storyline from previous "Pokémon" video games. They pointed out that there wasn't much background information and clear reasons for why the main characters suddenly agreed to become Pokémon Trainers. Jose Otero from "IGN" mentioned that Serena represented girls and Calem represented boys, and they were actually more interesting as rival characters for players. In the "X and Y" video games, Nintendo and Game Freak focused more on showing friendship than intense competition. Similar to Otero, Randolph Ramsay from "GameSpot" stated that the main characters in "X and Y" had a unique charm even though the game's storyline wasn't very captivating. Meanwhile, Victoria McNally from "The Mary Sue" liked the character Serena in "X and Y" because she represented female players and gave them choices to change her hairstyle and clothing style.

Serena received positive feedback for her character portrayal in the anime, which was different from her depiction in the video games. In this version, Serena's character development happened gradually. Initially introduced as a shy person, she transformed into someone wise and capable of making tough decisions. This change was also evident in her evolving hairstyle and clothing throughout the season, including when she returned in "Pokémon Journeys". Additionally, Serena became well-known for her close relationship with Ash Ketchum, which developed into romantic feelings. Megan Peters from "Comic Book" described Serena as one of Ash's best friends, if not the best, who not only showcased character growth since her first appearance but also formed a heartfelt connection with Ash. This caused fans to have mixed feelings, some liking it and some not. Similarly, Brian Ashcraft from "Kotaku" mentioned that Serena wasn't just a regular friend to Ash, as they had known each other since childhood. For the first time, albeit subtly, the Pokémon anime portrayed a romantic connection between the two main characters.

However, Serena's portrayal of romantic feelings towards Ash has also faced criticism for being seen as excessive, especially regarding the kissing scene in the final episode of "Pokémon XYZ". Scott Wilson from "Sora News 24" wrote that it was "strange to see a kissing scene between Serena and Ash," particularly because Ash himself seemed to be "stuck" at the age of 10 throughout the Pokémon anime, which has been running since 1997. For Pokémon, a show aimed at children, the addition of such a scene was seen as awkward. Similarly, Max Chang from "Nextshark" stated that the kissing scene between Serena and Ash was the first time that the Pokémon anime felt odd. This was because the producers had always tried to keep the anime pure by avoiding sensitive scenes that wouldn't be suitable for young viewers.

Among fans, the romantic relationship between Serena and Ash is known as "Amourshipping", and it's indirectly acknowledged by The Pokémon Company staff. Serena is the first female traveling companion to kiss Ash on the lips. It was later revealed that this storyline was planned by Tetsuo Yajima, the director of the "Pokémon XY" anime, along with producer Shukichi Kanda. However, since the primary target audience for the "Pokémon" anime is children, the kissing scene couldn't be shown openly. It was intentionally made ambiguous, with Serena's lifted foot and a surprised expression on Pikachu, Clemont, Bonnie, and Dedenne's faces. A online petition was created by fans in Japan and the United States with the hope of having Serena continue her journey with Ash to the Alola region in the "Pokémon Sun & Moon" anime. However, this petition didn't ultimately influence the producer's decisions. A fan-made imaginative poster went viral on the internet in early 2020, portraying Serena and Ash as adults who are married and have two children.

Henri Paul

Henri Paul (3 July 1956 – 31 August 1997) was a French chauffeur, who served as Head of Security at the Hôtel Ritz Paris in Paris, France. He was best known for being the hotel's hired chauffeur for the Mercedes-Benz in which Diana, Princess of Wales, Dodi Fayed and himself died.

Born in Lorient, Paul was one of the five children of Jean Paul, a teacher, and Gisèle Paul, who worked at the city council. An aviation aficionado, Paul earned his pilot's license at age 18 from Vannes and served in the Air Force. After graduating from high school, he decided to move to Paris, where he initially worked as an aviation instructor and later in the nautical industry selling boats. In 1986, he was hired at the Hôtel Ritz Paris, eventually becoming a confidant of the Al-Fayed family, owner of the hotel. Initially deputy head of security, on June 30, 1997, he became the head of security at the Ritz.

Paul was on duty the night of August 31, 1997, taking Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Al-Fayed from the Hôtel Ritz Paris to an apartment on rue Arsène Houssaye, a short distance from the hotel. At the wheel of a Mercedes S280, Paul drove at high speed in order to outrun the paparazzi who were chasing the vehicle.

Although he suffered numerous fractures to his facial bones (only he was wearing a seat belt). The Paris Prosecutor's Office obtained information through the Criminal Brigade with the aim of clarifying the causes of the incident. The investigation concluded, as would the later British investigation, that the driver was driving recklessly under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The toxicological studies carried out a few days after the accident under the direction of Professor Ivan Ricordel showed traces of prescription drugs for Paul as well as a blood alcohol level of 1.87 grams per liter of blood, more than three times the authorized limit for driving in France (a second test, commissioned by the Paris prosecutor's office, confirmed a rate of between 1.73 and 1.75 g/l). Paul was also allegedly taking several medications at the time of his death: Prozac, an antidepressant, Noctamid, a sleeping pill, Tiapride, a neuroleptic often used against alcoholism and Aotal, an acamprosate. All these medications recommend in their prospects not to drive if you consume them. The investigations carried out in the framework of the judicial investigation established that Henri Paul had bank accounts for a total amount of approximately one million francs (around 152,400 euros) at the time of the events and that he had in his possession on the night of the accident a sum of money just over 1,900 francs (about 290 euros). This data fed several conspiracy theories which present Paul as an informant for the DGSE, MI6 or even Mossad. Apparently, the paparazzi obtained (for a fee) information about the people who reported to him as head of security at Hôtel Ritz Paris. On September 3, 1999, the nine photographers and the motorcyclist accused of "involuntary homicides and injuries" as well as "failure to assist people in danger" did not come to trial when the charges were withdrawn, blaming the justice system for the accident on Paul, who was driving under the influence of alcohol and various psychotropic drugs.

Fencing at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Open foil

The foil event was an open demonstration event next to the four official fencing events on the fencing at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme. A total of 22 fencers from 12 nations competed and fenced 12 matches; eight matches in the French style and four in the Italian style. The matches took place on 23 July 1908, at the Prince's Hall in London from 21:00.

While, the men's foil event was an official event at the earliest three Olympics (1986, 1900 and 1904) and afterwards also from 1912, it was a demonstration event in 1908. The aim of the event was to demonstrate the different styles of foil fencing being practiced in the different countries. Because the styles were very different, it wasn’t possible to compare them. There were no official results of the matches, as the scores were not kept during the matches.

As it was the only open event, it was the only event that could be entered by women. British champion Millicent Hall entered for the event and so became the first women Olympic fencer, as official female medal events were on the Olympic programme from 1928.

Black sitcom

A Black sitcom is a sitcom in American culture that mainly features an African American cast. Although sitcoms with mostly Black characters have been present since the earliest days of network television, this genre became more prominent in the 1990s.

In these days, Black actors were often cast in roles like comic clowns in a tradition tracing back to the genre of Black minstrelsy popular in the early 20th century. 

"Amos 'n Andy" was the first television sitcom to portray Black people. It was widely popular. The 1951-53 television show replaced the white actors from the original radio show with Black actors. They represented Black individuals as businesspeople, judges, lawyers and policemen. Amos 'n Andy was canceled after airing over 70 episodes because the NAACP alleged that the show was stereotyping.

Then there were no all-Black sitcoms shown in the U.S. until the 1970s.

A series of popular Black sitcoms appeared in the 1970s. These include "That's My Mama", "Good Times", "Sanford and Son", "What's Happening!!", and "The Jeffersons". These sitcoms have been criticized as fostering an image of segregation. They also helped to perpetuate a belief that Black and white cultures are so different that integration is unwanted and unworkable. In the 1980s, sitcoms such as "The Cosby Show", "A Different World", and "Frank's Place", challenged stereotypical portrayals of Black people. They were nevertheless seen as "Black" (segregated) even with white actors.

After the 1980s, the major U.S. television networks appeared to lose interest in Black sitcoms. In the 1990s, newer networks such as Fox, The WB and UPN, anxious to establish themselves with a Black audience. The networks featured Black sitcoms such as "Martin" and "Living Single". They drew high ratings among Black households. They were also profitable even with a limited white viewership. 

Though there were some Black sitcoms successful with white audiences in the 1990s such as "Family Matters", "Moesha", "Sister, Sister" and "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air", the number of new programs continued to decline. 
From 1997 to 2001, the number of Black sitcoms on U.S. television declined from 15 to 6 as white viewership declined. That decline has continued. Civil rights organizations have accused networks of denying minorities equal opportunity as well as a greater participation in general television programming.

Black sitcoms in the 2010s included "The Game", "A.N.T. Farm", "Are We There Yet?," "Tyler Perry's For Better Or Worse", "Love That Girl!", "Let's Stay Together" and "Reed Between the Lines". Reruns of popular 1990s Black sitcoms aired on BET, Bounce TV, TV Land, TV One, MTV2, and TBS.

On August 10, 2012, "Tyler Perry's House of Payne" became the longest-running sitcom with mostly an African-American cast in the history of American television in terms of number of episodes, beating "The Jeffersons".

On September 24, 2014, over 11 million people watched the premiere episode of the ABC sitcom "Black-ish". The sitcom was met with mostly positive reviews. It had 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The show includes many references to current racial issues in America. "Black-ish"s two spin-off shows, "Mixed-ish" and "Grown-ish", also have African-American leads and deal with racial issues.

Girls of Enghelab protests in Iran

In 2022, Iran had a dress-code which specified what kinds of clothes were acceptable in public, and which ones were not. Since the 1980s, women have to cover their hair, using what is called hijab. In 2022, people protested against this ruling. These protests became known as Enghelab protests (). They are seen as part of a wider movement to make Iran a more democratic country since the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, in which the US and the UK overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran, Mohammad Mosaddegh, due to his policy to nationalize Iran's oil industry. The protests were inspired by Vida Movahed (), an Iranian woman known as the Girl of Enghelab Street (). She was given that name, because she stood in the crowd on a utility box on Enghelab Street (Revolution Street) in Tehran on 27 December 2017 during the 2017-2018 Iranian protests; a white cloth, to a stick, and waved it to the crowd as a flag. She was arrested on that day and was released temporary on bail a month later, on 28 January 2018. Some people interpreted Movahed's action as being based on Masih Alinejad's call for White Wednesdays, a protest movement that the presenter at VOA Persian Television started in early 2017. Other women later re-enacted her protest and posted photos of their actions on social media. These women are described as the "Girls of Enghelab Street" and "The Girls Of Revolution Street" in English sources. Some of the protesters however claim that they were not following Masih Alinejad's call. The protests intensified in 2022 due to the death of Mahsa Amini.

In the Islamic law of Iran imposed shortly after the 1979 Revolution, article 638 of 5th book of Islamic Penal Code (called Sanctions and deterrent penalties) women who do not wear a hijab may be imprisoned from ten days to two months, and/or required to pay fines from Rls.50,000 to Rls.500,000 . Fines are recalculated in the courts to index for inflation. This has been translated and published by the Legal Information Institute of Cornell Law School.

Article 639 says, two types of people shall be sentenced one year to ten years' imprisonment; first a person who establishes or directs a place of immorality or prostitution, second, a person who makes it easier for people to commit immorality or prostitution. or encourages them to do this.

Itapotihyla

Itapotihyla is a genus of frogs. It is in the family Hylidae. It is monotypic. This means there is only one species in "Itapotihyla": Itapotihyla langsdorffii. It is called the ocellated treefrog in English. Most of these frogs live in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, but a few more live in eastern Paraguay, other parts of Brazil, and northeastern Argentina.

"Itapotihyla langsdorffii" is large for a tree frog. The male frogs and female frogs look different. The adult female frog is larger. Most are from nose to rear end and the male frogs are long.

These frogs lay eggs in bodies of water in the rainforest. Sometimes they lay eggs in bodies of water that dry up. Sometimes they lay eggs in bodies of water that are there all year. This frog is an explosive breeder. That means it has many, many young at the same time. The female frogs lay 6000 eggs at a time, on average. The males sing very loud for the females. Sometimes the male frogs grab and push and fight each other. This is strange for frogs. In most frogs, the males fight each other in species where males are bigger than females.

This frog eats animals with bones on the outside, for example grasshoppers and crickets. It sometimes eats animals with spines, for example other frogs like "Physalaemus crombiei" and "Scinax argyreornatus", or even birds. Scientists know because they found bones and feathers in the frogs' stomachs. Snakes, for example "Chironius bicarinatus", a colubrid, eat this frog.

"Itapotihyla langsdorffii" lives in trees in rainforests. It only lives in places that human beings have not changed. The "Itapotihyla langsdorffii" that live in Paraguay are dying because of habitat loss but the ones in Brazil are not.

Hyloscirtus

Hyloscirtus is a genus of frogs. They are Neotropical frogs. They are in the family Hylidae. Scientists stopped using this genus fora time, but they started again in 2005 after they looked at the Hylidae family again. They decided to put these species in the same genus because of their DNA: They all have the same 56 transformations in nuclear and mitochondrial proteins and ribosomal genes. Of these species, 28 species had been in "Hyla" before 2005. These frogs have fringed skin on the toes of their front and back feet.

Most of these frogs live in the hills and mountains in the Andes mountain range. They live as far south as Bolivia and as far north as Venezuela. A few species live in places near the Andes that are not hills are mountains. These places are called "páramo". Two species ("H. colymba" and "H. palmeri") live in Panama and Costa Rica. They live near streams where they lay their eggs. Some of the species in this genus are dying out. This is because humans change the places where they live, because of pollution, because humans brought new animals that eat the same food, because humans brought trout, whuch eat them, and because the chytrid fungus "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis" makes them sick.

The first frogs in "Hyloscirtus" existed 51 million years ago.

There are 37 species in this genus:
AmphibiaWeb also lists "Hyloscirtus estevesi" as its own species but the Amphibian Species of World following Barrio-Amorós and colleagues (2019) says it is the same frog as "Hyloscirtus jahni".

Neue Deutsche Härte

Neue Deutsche Härte (; "New German Hardness"), sometimes shortened to NDH, is a style of rock music well known in Germany and Austria. It started from Neue Deutsche Welle and the term was used by the music press after the release of Rammstein's first album "Herzeleid".

Neue Deutsche Härte is a crossover style from Neue Deutsche Welle, alternative metal, and groove metal. They merge it with elements from electro-industrial and techno music. Most NDH bands have an electric guitar, bass guitar, drums, and vocals. They may also have keyboards, synthesizers, samples and sometimes drum machines. NDH uses guitars that are distorted and tuned low (drop D or drop C). In most NDH songs, there is an importance of showing predominance. This is done by overpronouncing some syllables and sounds (such as the uvular [sound made with the uvula] or alveolar trill [sound made with the tongue touching or near the alveolar]). The vocals are usually in German, sung by a deep, male voice. Some bands use screaming and death growls, used in songs by Oomph!, Rammstein, Joachim Witt, Megaherz, and Eisbrecher.

The basics of the NDH style were set up by Oomph! on their second album, "Sperm" (1994), and by Rammstein with their first album "Herzeleid" (1995). Oomph!'s biggest impact was from groove metal bands such as Prong, Pantera, and Sepultura. Rammstein, who takes inspiration from many bands, such as Depeche Mode and Ministry, is one of NDH's most influential bands. NDH is specially successful in continental Europe; Rammstein having sold almost four million records in Germany, and earning gold and platinum records in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, and Finland.

Oomph! got a gold record for their 2004 single "Augen auf!" in Austria and Germany. Eisbrecher's 2004 self-titled debut album came at No. 13 on the Deutschen Alternative Top 20 Chart, while their second album came at No. 85 on the German main chart.

In 2011, comedian and musician Bill Bailey released a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's "Scarborough Fair" in the NDH style. The lyrics are directly translated, sparking controversy from German audiences.

Platz, Nym, and Balanck show Neue Deutsch Härte as a strong and powerful mix of German metal and hardcore influences and elements of techno – all coming together with the abilities of modern music production.

"Cobra Kai" is a spin-off of the movie "The Karate Kid" and its first two sequels. In it, Johnny Lawrence, who was the bully in the first movie is an adult and he hates the kid he bullied Daniel LaRusso who has now gotten rich from selling cars, so Johnny starts his own dojo called Cobra Kai based on the one where he learned karate to teach martial arts to a kid named Miguel Diaz so that he can fight back against his bullies. Daniel believes that Cobra Kai is evil because of what happened to him in "The Karate Kid" and "The Karate Kid Part III". So Daniel and Johnny end up as enemies.

Johnny Lawrence is fired from his job for calling his boss a bitch. Johnny helps a teenager named Miguel by fighting his bullies for him but says he won’t teach Miguel karate. Then a teenage girl accidentally crashes her car into Johnny’s while driving with her friends but runs away after seeing Johnny. Johnny goes to Daniel LaRusso to get his car fixed and finds out that Daniel’s daughter Sam was in the car that hit his. So Johnny decides to teach Miguel by starting his own dojo called Cobra Kai and teaches Miguel everything that John Kreese taught him in The Karate Kid. Johnny gets more students but his son Robbie Keene hates him so he goes to Daniel to work for him. Daniel teaches Robbie karate the way Mister Miyagi taught him but then finds out that he’s Johnny’s son and is angry. Robbie decides to join the karate tournament and makes it almost to the end but Johnny’s student Hawk injures Robbie’s shoulder so he can’t fight. Daniel tells Robbie that Johnny Lawrence is Daniel’s enemy but isn’t Robbie’s. Daniel also says that the bad things Johnny did weren’t his fault since he was only doing what his Sensei taught him. Daniel also gets a doctor to help him so Robbie can get back in. Robbie fights Miguel so Miguel attacks Robbie’s shoulder and wins. 

After Miguel wins, Daniel LaRusso starts a dojo called Miyagi-Do. While Jonny starts to say that the kids at Cobra Kai should have honour. Then John Kreese comes back and convinces Johnny to let him teach karate at Cobra Kai. When the students at Cobra Kai become bullies, a lot of the kids go to Daniel LaRusso at Miyagi-Do and ask him to teach them. Johnny Lawrence falls in love with Miguel’s mother. All the Miyagi-Do and Cobra Kai students get into a fight at their High School. Miguel fights Robbie and wins but then stops fighting because Johnny told him that sometimes he should show mercy. Then Robbie threw Miguel off a balcony and Robbie ended up in a coma. John Kreese convinced all the students at Cobra Kai to stop listening to Johnny Lawrence because Johnny was weak so they decided Kreese was their new Sensei. 

After Miguel’s coma ends, Johnny helps him learn to walk again. Sensei John Kreese breaks into Daniel LaRusso’s car company and puts a living snake in a car Daniel was trying to sell. Kreese’s students at Cobra Kai also attack a nerdy Miyagi-Do student named Demetri and breaks his arm. Daniel’s wife Amanda goes to the Cobra Kai dojo to talk to Kreese and he says that he believes that his students should have no mercy on the enemy. So Amanda slaps Kreese in the face. So Kreese goes to the police and gets a Restraining Order against her. Miguel convinced Johnny Lawrence to start his own dojo called Eagle Fang to teach people karate with honour. Daniel goes back to Japan and meets with Chozen from The Karate Kid Part II who teaches him how to kill an enemy. Johnny’s son Robbie decides that he hates his father enough to join Cobra Kai and joins Cobra Kai. Daniel and Johnny fight Kreese and Daniel almost kills Kreese. Then Kreese tells Jonny and Daniel that he’ll close his dojo Cobra Kai if either Miyagi-Do or Eagle Fang wins the next karate tournament. Daniel and Johnny then decide to work together so that can happen. John Kreese also remembers his origin story about how when he was young his mother killed herself and he got bullied so he learned to fight, fell in love and joined the army. He then went to Vietnam where he learned Tangsudo from his Captain and met Terry Silver. One of their friends got killed and then Kreese, Silver and the Captain were captured. The Viet Cong decided to have the Captain and Silver fight over a pit of snakes but Kreese said to fight him instead. The Captain told Kreese that Kreese’s girlfriend was dead. The American army came so the Viet Cong ran away and Kreese still pushed the Captain into the pit so the snakes could kill him and lied that the Viet Cong had done that. Kreese then became the new Captain. 

After Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence start working together, John Kreese calls Terry Silver and asks for his help in teaching at Cobra Kai. Silver says yes. Silver then tricks Johnny into coming to his dojo Cobra Kai and starts beating him up but Kreese stops him and is angry. So Silver tells a man nicknamed Stingray that he’ll let him join Cobra Kai again if he tells the police that Kreese was the one who beat him into a coma. Silver then beats him into a coma. Silver bribes the referee to let Cobra Kai win against Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang so that Johnny and Daniel have to close their dojos. Then the police come and arrest Kreese for attempted murder. Daniel calls Chozen from Japan to figure out how to get rid of Silver. Miguel goes to Mexico to look for his father and Johnny goes to Mexico to find Miguel. 

Terry Silver threatens Daniel so Daniel sends Chozen to spy on Silver but Silver finds out. So Daniel and Chozen find Mike Barnes from The Karate Kid Part III who tells them that Silver signed a contract giving him control of his dojo Cobra Kai. When Silver finds out Mike Barnes is looking for the contract, Silver burns down Mike Barnes’s store. Daniel tries to surrender to Silver but Silver beats Daniel up and says he’s not going to kill him yet since he wants him to suffer more. Johnny Lawrence gets Miguel’s mother pregnant. Johnny and Daniel re-open their dojo Miyagi-Fang because of how much more bullying there now is from Silver and Cobra Kai. Johnny, Chozen and Mike Barnes get drunk and break into Silver’s house to try to kill him. Silver stabs Chozen and fights Johnny and wins. Miyagi-Fang students break into the Cobra Kai dojo to steal security camera videotapes of Silver bribing the referee. Silver goes to the dojo to fight them but then Daniel LaRusso goes there to protect the kids from Silver. Daniel fights Silver using the karate that Silver taught him in The Karate Kid Part III and wins. The police come and arrest Silver. Cobra Kai closes down. John Kreese escapes prison.

Their works have lyrics in German and English, but use mostly German on their recent albums. (Some of their songs, such as: GlaubeLiebeTod, Monster, Des Wahnsinns fette Beute, XXV and Ritual is in German only).

Oomph! used many styles of music such as metal, industrial, alternative rock, electronica, and gothic metal to make their sound. Their style has changed between their self-titled debut album, "Oomph!" (1992), and the album after it called "Sperm" (1994). Although they started with a very dance-heavy industrial sound, they quickly moved to a much heavier guitar-driven metal sound. However, they still recognize their electronic roots. This guitar-driven and electronic accompanied sound inspired many musicians, most famously Rammstein, Megaherz, and Eisbrecher.

Oomph! was signed on Virgin Schallplatten between 1998 and 2001. They released three albums; the first, "Unrein", was released in 1998.

They finished their contract with Virgin Schallplatten, as the band felt that they never fully explored their potential. They did not continue with the record company. With the benefits of major-label status, Oomph! gained more fans and toured with labelmate Skunk Anansie in 1999. They later opened for Finnish rock band HIM in the fall of 2001.

As the storm moved across Florida, it slowly weakened into a tropical storm on September 29, before moving off the coast and strengthening into a hurricane again on September 30. The storm made landfall in South Carolina later that day, bringing strong winds and causing many power outages in the Carolinas and Virginia.

Frumentius was a Bishop known as the person who started the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and who brought Christianity to Ethiopia.

Frumentius was born in the 4th Century in Tyre which is now Lebanon. Frumentius and his brother Edesius were shipwrecked in Eritrea. Everyone else on the ship was killed by the people there but Frumentius and Edesius were captured and sold into slavery. They became slaves of Ousanas, the King of the tribe of Axum. Ousanas freed them before his death and his widow hired them to tutor her son Ezana, King of Axum. 

While teaching Ezana, Frumentius tried to convince as many people as he could to become Christian. Once Ezana was an adult both Frumentius and his brother Edesius left Ethiopia. Edesius went back home to Tyre but Frumentius went to Egypt to convince Athanasias the creator of the Athanasian Creed to appoint missionaries to Axum. So Athanasius appointed Frumentius as a bishop. Frumentius went back to Ethiopia this time with Christian priests to start Churches and to convince people there to become Christians. Frumentius even managed to get King Ezana to convert to Christianity. When the Roman Empire told Ezana to replace Frumentius with another bishop, because Frumentius didn’t believe in the Nicene Creed, Ezana said no.

In Ethiopia, the Orthodox Church says that Frumentius is a Saint and they call him Saint Frumentius.

Notes

Pfarrwiese

Pfarrwiese was a stadium in Vienna, Austria. It was the home ground of SK Rapid Wien from 1912 till 1978.
After the loan for the Sportplatz Rudolfsheim was quited SK Rapid went to Hütteldorf where they built a new home. The place was owned by the St Peter's Abbey in Salzburg and managed by the parish of Hütteldorf. This is the reason why the ground was called "Pfarrwiese". The loan was 800 Kronen/Year (which is approximately 4.300 €). Also two tickets for each match were part of the contract.

The ground was built between August 1911 and April 1912. Architect was Eduard Schönecker, who also planed the Hohe Warte Stadium.
The capacity was 4 000 and was step by step expanded to 8000. The pitch was borderd with a cinder track. The place was opened on 28 April 1912 with two matches in front of 3000 visitors. Rapid played versus WAC and won 2-1. The main match was Amateure versus Cricketer.

The club decided to built a stadium because Rapid became very sucessful and the old place was therefore to small. In June 1919 15 000 people where at the Pfarrwiese to see the match versus MTK Budapest. The new stadium was also planed by Eduard Schönecker. It had a capacity of 24. 150. If a lot of people were expected Rapid went often to the Praterstadion. The demages in the Second World War were small so the first match on the Pfarrwiese was held on 1 May 1945. A combined team of SK Rapid and Vienna played versus a team of the Red Army. The last modifications were made in 1955. In 1977 the Weststadion was built and Rapid left the Pfarrwiese. In 1986 a tennis facility was built.

Climax Blues Band

Climax Blues Band is a British blues rock band. The band was formed in Stafford, England, in 1967 by vocalist and harmonica player Colin Cooper (1939–2008), guitarist and vocalist Pete Haycock (1951–2013), guitarist Derek Holt (b. 1949), bassist and keyboardist Richard Jones (b. 1949), drummer George Newsome (b. 1947), and keyboardist Arthur Wood (1929–2005).

The band was originally known as The Climax Chicago Blues Band. In 1972 the group shortened its name to Climax Blues Band. 

The band has released at least 19 albums. They had a Top 10 hit in the UK with "Couldn't Get It Right". That song and "I Love You" were also hits in the United States. "Couldn't Get It Right" reached number 3 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 in 1977, and "I Love You" peaked at number 12 in 1981.

Jones left the group in 1969 and Holt began playing bass. The band switched labels to Harvest Records in 1970. Later records had a more rock-oriented feel. John Cuffley replaced Newsome in 1971.

Albums issued in the 1970s include "FM/Live" (1973), a double set recorded at a concert in New York, and the studio albums "Stamp Album" (1975) and "Gold Plated" (1976), featuring the single "Couldn't Get It Right". In the 1970s, the band's concerts in the US were attended by up to 20,000 people. By 1981 the band was moving towards a pop-rock sound. Holt and Cuffley left in 1983.

A previously unknown recording of a live performance was released as "Climax Blues Band/World Tour 1976" by the Major League Productions (MLP) record label.

The album "Sample and Hold" was recorded for Virgin Records in 1983 by Haycock, Cooper, and Glover, with a rhythm section composed of the session musicians Dave Marquee and Henry Spinetti. A follow-up album was in the works. Cooper bowed out and cited personal reasons. Haycock went on to record several solo projects. The first one was the album "Total Climax", with his band, Pete Haycock's Climax. The band toured many times in Europe, including Communist East Germany, and led a well-received tour in Australia. After that, Haycock was asked by his former Climax Blues Band manager Miles Copeland to record an instrumental album, "Guitar and Son", and the live album "Night of the Guitars" (from the tour of the same name) for the I.R.S. No Speak label. After that tour, Haycock teamed up with the guitarist Steve Hunter and former Climax Blues bandmate Derek Holt to record the album "H Factor". He was later recruited by Bev Bevan to become a member of Electric Light Orchestra Part II. He recorded and toured with the group as early as 1990. He also started his film score career at this time, playing the lead on Hans Zimmer's score to "Thelma and Louise". He also performed on the "Night of the Guitars" tours, which included Holt on bass, keyboards, and occasional vocals.

Holt wrote "I Love You", one of the Climax Blues Band's biggest hits. It is included on the Climax Blues Band double album, "25 Years 1968–1993", released by the German label Repertoire in 1993. "I Love You" still gets over 20,000 radio hits a year in the US. The song was used in Finn Taylor's 2002 movie "Cherish" and in Kevin Smith's 2008 movie "Zach and Miri make a Porno". In 1983 Holt joined drummer Brendan Day and Nektar guitarist Roye Albrighton to record an album under the name Grand Alliance for the A&M label.

In 1985, Cooper and Glover recruited guitarist Lester Hunt, drummer Roy Adams, and original member Derek Holt to record the Climax Blues Band album "Drastic Steps". The line-up toured in support of the album in the UK, Europe, and America. The new line-up soon became established with Cooper, Glover, Hunt, Adams and Neil Simpson in the early 1990s. They released the live album "Blues from the Attic" in 1993 and "Big Blues" in 2004.

Colin Cooper (born 7 October 1939) died of cancer on 3 July 2008, at age 68. He had two children. He wanted the band to continue, as the other musicians had all been long-serving (Glover since 1980, Adams and Hunt since 1985, and Simpson since 1991). Cooper was replaced by singer and saxophone and harmonica player Johnny Pugh, who retired in 2012. He was replaced in turn by vocalist Graham Dee and saxophone player Chris Aldridge. Pete Haycock died on 30 October 2013, at age 62.

The band still continues to tour without any remaining original members.

Amorphea

Amorphea are part of a taxonomic large group that contains protists, like Amoebozoa and Obazoa. The ISP, or the International Society of Protistologists (people who study protists) suggested in 2012 that the back term for this large group, Unikont, be changed to Amorphea since the name "Unikont" is a synapomorphy that was shown wrong. 

Thomas Cavalier-Smith has offered two new phyla: Sulcozoa, which consists of the subphyla Diphyllatea, Discocelida, Mantamonadidae, Planomonadida and Rigifilida. The effectiveness of this offered taxonomy has yet to be ruled on by the ISP.

More work by Cavalier-Smith has exhibited that Sulcozoa is paraphyletic. Apusozoa also looks like it is paraphyletic. Varisulca now includes planomonads, Mantamonas and Collodictyon.

Willem van Hanegem

Willem "Wim" van Hanegem (; born 20 February 1944) is a Dutch former football player and coach who played as a midfielder. In a playing career spanning over 20 years, he won several domestic honours in the Netherlands, as well as a European Cup and a UEFA trophy, all with Feyenoord. He was also a finalist in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. As a manager, he won the league and cup with Feyenoord and spent a period as the Dutch national team's assistant coach. His most recent job as manager was for FC Utrecht, from 2007 to 2008. Complete midfielder, he played as a playmaker in front of the defense. For his arched legs, always slightly bent, the particular and ungainly gait, with his chin on his chest, Van Hanegem was nicknamed "de Kromme", which can be translated as "the hunchback" or "the hunchback". Strong character, rocky and fearless in tackling, he stood for tactical clarity, perfect throws with the outside of the left foot (he was also called "Crooked", "the backhand"), assists and decisive goals, often on free-kick. His ability to transform set pieces is of singular importance: with only one or two running steps he managed to score in free kicks, giving the ball extremely high speed. The only shortcoming of him was a certain and lack of rhythm. He is widely considered as one of the best Dutch football players in history.

He grew up in Utrecht with his mother Anna and three brothers, after the massacre in his native country in which he lost his father, three brothers and other relatives. In the summer of 1944 the German army was fleeing north from Calais to the Netherlands. On 11 September the Allies bombed the Wehrmachtnear Breskens. Father Lo and brother Izaak hid in a shelter that was shot and both died. Van Hanegem then lost another brother and sister during the war.

After promotion to the Eerste divisie in 1962, he belonged to the squad of semi-professionals of the league team, which, however, continued to be overshadowed by the "big" Utrecht clubs DOS and Elinkwijk. He played with Velox in the second division for four years before moving to Rotterdam in 1966 for the newly promoted Eredivisie XerxesDZB, who finished tenth in their first season. In 1968 he went to local rivals Feijenoord and celebrated his greatest successes with this club. He was Dutch champion in 1969, 1971 and 1974. In 1970, with Feyenoord, and became the first Dutch club to win the European Cup, before arch-rivals Ajax Amsterdam's heyday started. In the Milan final, his side beat Celtic Glasgow 2-1. In 1974 he won not only the championship with Feyenoord, but also the UEFA Cup in the final against Tottenham Hotspur. Van Hanegem was known as a tactically skilled midfielder with fine passing. In 1976 he moved to Dutch league rivals AZ Alkmaar for three years and wanted to end his career in the USA with Chicago Sting in 1979. However, he returned to the Netherlands that same year, playing for FC Utrecht until 1981 and again for Feyenoord until 1983.

Van Hanegem made his national team debut against Scotland on 30 May 1968, At the World Cup in 1974 in Germany and also in qualifying for this tournament van Hanegem was a regular player. In the Dutch 4-3-3 system, he usually played in left midfield next to Neeskens and behind Rensenbrink, including in the final, which the Netherlands lost to Germany 2-1, Van Hanegem was known for rough, passionate play against German sides (before the 1974 final, he exhorted the Dutch side to "stuff the Germans"). "I don't like Germans. Everytime I played against German players, I had a problem because of the war." After the game (with Germany winning 2–1) Van Hanegem left the field in tears. Two years later he finished third at the 1976 UEFA European Football Championship in Yugoslavia where he was sent off in the semi-final against Czechoslovakia. He was omitted to be selected for the Dutch during the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina along with Hugo Hovenkamp, Johan Cruyff and Willy van de Kuijlen. He played his last international match against Belgium in 1979.

After ending his playing career, he first became an assistant coach in 1983 at Feyenoord. He was later head coach at AZ Alkmaar, Sparta Rotterdam and also at Feyenoord from 1992 to 1995, where he won the league once (1993) and the cup twice (1994 and 1995). He was sacked in October 1995 and shortly thereafter transferred to Saudi Arabia, where he took over Al-Hilal for one season.

He worked for the Dutch Football Association as coach of the amateur national team in 1991–92 and he was assistant coach to Dick Advocaat in the Netherlands national team from 2002 to 2004.

From July 2007 to December 2008 he was the manager of the Dutch first division club FC Utrecht.

Bee Branch Creek (Iowa)

The Bee Branch Creek is a creek in Dubuque, Iowa, that flows into the Mississippi River. The city has changed it multiple times over the years to make floods smaller. The newest change involves making the river more like a normal one. This comes after it being in a sewer.

No one knows how the Bee Branch got its name. Some think it could have been a name for one of its tributaries. It got the current name by 1863 though the name lived before then. Earlier, the Bee Branch had the name Couler Creek, after the Couler Valley. "Couler Creek" was used even after 1863, being used in some geology books.

In the 1800s, the creek had many floods. On flood along the creek were thought to be especially bad by news stations like the Quad-City Times. An early plan to fix flooding that the Bee Branch did was to move its flow north into the Little Maquoketa River.

The Bee Branch Restoration Project is not the first try at making floods smaller. It was planned to put the old creek underground through a storm sewer in the early 1900s. The sewer was finished by 1905. The Dubuque Enterprise, an old newspaper company, thought it was good.

The years 1999, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2010, and 2011 saw very damaging floods totaling in costs to $70 million. The first storm prompted the city to research an engineering project on the 100-year floods. It was found that the sewers were not big enough for large storms. Detention basins, ponds that collect water, were added in the area. Also, the sewer became a river to hold more water.
The creek is will likely have a healthy ecosystem. In the Lower Bee Branch, 14 native species of fish and the common carp has been found in it. Many of these fish are fish that are hunted like the bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, and others. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources thought the creek had good levels of life. This was also interesting because of how new it is.

Free Syrian Army

The Free Syrian Army is a faction in the Syrian Civil War formed in 29th July 2011, it has fought against the Syrian Arab Armed Forces, and pro-Assad militias, it was formed by former syrian officers. With multiple Syrian Civil War rebel groups calling themselves the "Free Syrian Army". During 2011, it was called the "Main Syrian Rebel Group" as they had more guns than other rebel groups.

The Free Syrian Army has been overshadowed by Islamist Jihadist Groups, and a small civil war inside the Free Syrian Army started between Jihadists and other rebels such as the Al Nusra Front. Since July 2012, the Free Syrian Army was no longer the main rebel group, due to fighting and lack of funding.

During 2011, protests against the Assad government as a part of the Arab Spring, due to corruption and wanting freedom. The Syrian Government killed, mutilated and tortured hundreds and thousands of protesters. Syrian soldiers and officers defected from the Armed Forces and made the new "Free Syrian Army", due to the Goverments response to the protests.

There were hundreds of reports of Defections from the Syrian Arab Armed Forces defecting to the Free Syrian Army, as the Government still fired and killed the protestors, Syrian Rebels entered some cities and laid Siege on multiple cities such as Homs and Aleppo, there were reports of soldiers who refused to fire at protestors being executed.

After laying Siege on multiple cities, A colonel and other officers in their uniforms announced the Free Syrian Army, with the purpose of defending protestors, and taking down the Assad Regime. There were reports of battalions, regiments and units that did not follow orders and refused to fire at protestors. The Free Syrian Army called themselves the "Military Wing of the Syrian Oppositions".

The next day, the same orginization stated that in all 100 defectors were either killed or wounded.

A former Syrian Army General named Mustafa al-Sheikh said to Reuters that 20,000 soldiers defected since beginning of the war. And that the Free Syrian Army had taken control of a lot of land and later said in an interview "If we get 25,000 to 30,000 deserters mounting guerrilla warfare in small groups of six or seven it is enough to exhaust the army in a year to a year-and-a-half, even if they are armed only with rocket-propelled grenades and light weapons". Multiple defections happened in 2012.
During 2012, hundreds of former Syrian Army officers were defecting, deserters even fough in Damascus. Battles occured in Hama, Damascus, Qusayr, and multiple other towns and cities. Multiple defectors had tanks, BMPs, and other vehicles. A video was seen where the Free Syrian army had a BMP-2, firing at government forces.

In February 2012, Fahad Al Masri, a founder of the Free Syrian Army and Colonel Qassem Saad Eddin, along with other officers made Military Councils for each Governorate , and made a new press officer for propaganda, and morale purposes. Mustafa Al-Shiek, also a founder of the Free Syrian Army proposed a "Higher Military Revolutionary Council", which would be denied.

During January, some Damascus districts were under control of the Free Syrian Army for weeks or months at a time, but due to bombing from the Syrian Arab Armed Forces, most fighters went to other locations. During late February of 2012, The Free Syrian Army had full control of Idlib, and Opposition flags were all over the city of Idlib,
according to some Syrian Army officers, two-thirds of the city of Homs was under control of the Free Syrian Army for months.

In April of 2013, the Free Syrian Army lost multiple fighters because of Islamist factions, as they grew, Free Syrian Army fighters identified with groups such as Al-Nusra Front, which was becoming the best equipped Anti-Assad faction. The Free Army lost 3,000 men from joining Al-Nusra Front since the Free Syrian Army had little to no ammunition. A Western diplomat suggested that Al-Nusra Front would be cleaner, stronger and better, "fighters are moving from one group to another".

During May 2013, Salim Idris, the Leader of the Free Syrian Army said "the rebels were badly fragmented and lacked the military skill needed to topple the government of President Bashar al-Assad." And also that he was working on a "countrywide command structure". But the lack of Ammunition and supplies, low money and terrible logistics stopped him from doing so. He said "Now it is very important for them to be unified. But unifying them in a manner to work like a regular army is still difficult.".

On July of 2013, a Free Syrian Army officer was killed by a Jihadist group in the Governorate of Latakia.. Commanders of the Free Syrian Army reacted with "Fury" and warned about further fighting and violence after the killing. The officer's name was Kamal Hamami, he was killed and mutilated. "This will not go unpunished," said a former Syrian Army officer.

When ISIS first rose and took over Syrian land, the Free Syrian Army did not recognize ISIS as group against Assad, or work with the Islamic State. But sometimes, the Islamic state and the Free Syrian Army have helped each other during certain battles such as in the capture of Managh Air Base. According to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, either the Islamic State or Al-Qaeda detonated a Car bomb that killed 12 men. After the bomb hit, apparently missiles hit Syrian Army positions.

A high ranking Islamic State official, Abu Yusaf said in an interview in 2014, "In the East of Syria, there is no Free Syrian Army any longer. All Free Syrian Army people [there] have joined the Islamic State." He said this after the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Turkish Land Forces finished training the Free Syrian Army. The Islamic's state sweep of Iraq and Syria affected the size of the Free Syrian Army, and former fighters joining the Islamic State.

In 2015, Russia joined the Syrian Civil War to help out the Syrian Armed Forces and Bashar Al-Assad. The Russian Intervention has "stopped the advance of the opposition," according to Al-Jazeera. While a new side joins in the war, the Syrian Democratic Forces, a group of Kurdish and Arab militias in northern Syria. The Russians "double tap" air strikes that killed civilians and humanitarian aid workers. The Syrian Defense Forces didn't exactly fight the Free Syrian Army, but relations are complicated, there were recorded fights between the two, but they mainly fought ISIS along eachother. The airstrikes have also targeted Free Syrian Army, killing at least 6,000 men.
During 2016, Aleppo fell to the Syrian Army and their allies, kicking the Free Army from their last Urban stronghold, and staying in the desert. The Turkish Land Forces attacked Northern Syria to stop the advance of the Kurds and stop "Terrorists" and establish a "Safe Zone" According to Erdogan. Turkey would aid the Free Syrian Army, and then would later make their own version of the Free Syrian Army named the "Turkish-Backed Free Syrian Army" or simply the Syrian National Army, serving as the main military unit of the opposition with better funding.

In 2017,the Syrian National Army was formed, the group was named the "Turkish-Backed Syrian Free Army". A lot of the Free Syrian Army fighters joined the Syrian National Army, since they have better gear, and more ammunitions. And they were funded by Turkey, and use Turkish weapons and operated Turkish vehicles such as the FNSS ACV-15. And also funded by the with weapons U.S made such as the BGM-71 TOW and Mk-19s.
The Free Syrian Army has received aid from nations such as the United States and Qatar, each nation has a different purpose of supporting the Free Army, some nations have cut their funding to the Free Syrian Army, and stopped contact with the Free Army.
As soon as the Syrian Civil War started, the Gulf States (Saudia Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait) funded the Free Syrian Army and other opposition groups, so they can overthrow the Assad regime and stop Iran from influencing Saudia Arabia, and other Gulf States. The United States told the Gulf States to stop funding as the funded Islamist Jihad groups like Al-Nusra Front and such.
Turkey has funded the Free Syrian Army since 2011, they allowed defected officers to live in Turkey. And gave them weapons, gear and such. And when Turkey joined the Syrian Civil War officially in 2016, and in 2017, they made the "Turkish-Backed Free Syrian Army" or the Syrian National Army. And funded the group with weapons, vehicles, tanks and such. 
In 2014 under the Obama Administration, the United States's operation was code-named "Train and Equip Programme" and selected certain Syrian Opposition groups, the Free Syrian Army was one of the groups, and sent over $500,000,000 to the Free Syrian Army, and the CIA trained the Free Syrian Army and other groups. 157 troops were trained by the CIA.

The group was named Division 30, and was apart of the Free Syrian Army. It later joined the Al-Nusra Front after being stopped attempting to cross the border to Turkey. And they handed all of their weapons and some of their men to be able to pass the border.
During October of 2011, the Free Syrian Army had no armored vehicles, so they would use Hit-and-Run tactics against Shabiha (Pro-Assad thugs) and the Syrian Arab Armed Forces. They would plant bombs and fire at enemy buses and lightly armored Vehicles. The main tactics were generally guerrilla warfare. But they would use it only if they want to slowly take over a piece of land, during late 2011 the Free Syrian Army took over most of Syria.

The Free Syrian Army would use hit and run tactics to slowly push off the Syrian Armed Forces from certain places, and use IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) to stop or slow down Syrian Army convoys. Street battles happened in some towns that could have lasted for days. During massive attacks from Pro-Syrian Government forces, they would attack command and control centers and logistic companies or platoons. And sabotage would be used and small ambushes behind enemy lines that destrtoyed vehicles and such.

All of the communications of the Free Syrian Army was or is done by using a Walkie-Talkie, and Intelligence would be gathered by talking to locals and soldiers that are about to defect. And they would work also with Civilian councils and Human Rights groups that are observing a certain location or place. It would usually happen next to large population places such as Homs, Aleppo and Damascus.
The Free Syrian Army has or had multiple units in it's history. Since 29th July, 2011, multiple units were a part of the Free Syrian Army such as Jaish al-Izzah and other groups.
When the group was first formed, there were only four units, these included:

Frozen yogurt

Frozen yogurt (also known as frogurt or by the tradename Froyo; ) is a frozen dessert made with yogurt and sometimes other dairy and non-dairy products. Frozen yogurt is a frozen product containing the same basic ingredients as ice cream, but contains live bacterial cultures.

Usually more tart than ice cream (the tanginess in part due to the lactic acid in the yogurt), as well as lower in fat (due to the use of milk instead of cream), it is different from ice milk and conventional soft serve. Unlike yogurt, frozen yogurt is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, it is regulated by some U.S. states, such as California.

Frozen yogurt includes milk solids, some kind of sweetener, milk fat, yogurt culture (commonly "Lactobacillus bulgaricus" and "Streptococcus thermophilus"), plus flavorings and sometimes coloring (natural or artificial).

Milk fat makes up about 0.55–6% of the yogurt; added in quantities inversely proportional to the amount of milk solids, it lends richness to the yogurt. Milk solids represent 8–14% of the yogurt volume, providing lactose for sweetness and proteins for smoothness and increased resistance to melting. Sugar (beet or cane) provides 15–17% of the yogurt ingredients. In addition to adding sweetness, it increases the volume of solid ingredients, improving body and texture. Gelatin and/or vegetable additives (guar gum, carrageenan) stabilize the yogurt, reducing crystallization and increasing the temperature at which it will melt. This stabilization ensures that the frozen yogurt maintains a smooth consistency regardless of handling or temperature change.

Major companies often use assembly lines specifically dedicated to frozen yogurt production. Milk products and stabilizing agent(s) are combined and homogenized. At , the yogurt culture is added. The mix remains at this temperature until it sets and is ready for cooling. After that, the mix is cooled at a temperature of . Once it has reached the desired temperature and viscosity, the yogurt is allowed to sit in aging tanks for up to four hours. Sweeteners, flavorings, and colorings are then mixed in. The yogurt mixture is cooled at a temperature of −6 to . To create extra volume and smooth consistency, the air is incorporated into the yogurt as the mixture is agitated. With enough air in it, the yogurt is quickly frozen to prevent large ice crystals from forming. It is then stored in a cold place to be shipped.

Frozen yogurt can be made in a soft serve freezer much the same way as soft ice cream. Frozen yogurt mix is sold in either powder form that needs to be mixed with water or liquid form ready to pour into a soft-serve machine. A mix with high or low-fat content can be chosen, and the amount of air introduced into the soft-serve frozen yogurt is variable. The higher the fat level, the more air the yogurt can absorb. The more air goes into the mix as it freezes, the creamier the product will taste.

Frozen yogurt is served in a large variety of flavors and styles. It also has sugar-free and fat-free alternatives. Frozen yogurt shops usually offer a multitude of toppings, from fruit to nuts, popular cookie brands, and candies. Some companies offer a more tart version considered closer to the original recipe, while others focus on making their own taste more like ice cream.

He collapsed on 12 November 1972 while playing for Club Brugge against RFC Liège. He was clinically dead when he was transported off the pitch. He was successfully reanimated by the club doctor but the incident ended Rijnders' playing career. His health condition was never fully recovered. He died three years later at age 28. 

He was widely regarded to be one of the best defensive midfielders ever. He was renowned as a playmaker who knew how to make assists, pace, dribbling, man-marking and tackling.

Rijnders was born on July 30, 1947 in Breda. Rijnders registered with VV Baronie in 1958. As a youth player he made the switch to fellow town NAC in 1963. 
He made his debut on May 16, 1965. In a cup match against Enschedese Boys he made the winning goal 2-1 in the last minute. After a year in the First Division, promotion was won in 1966. Rijnders lost the cup final with NAC in 1967. Because winner Ajax was also national champion, the team qualified for European football. With Rijnders in the field, NAC played against Floriana FC and Cardiff City. However, it was a difficult season for NAC in which relegation was narrowly avoided. After the season, Rijnders moved to sub-topper Go Ahead Eagles for a transfer fee of 150,000 guilders. Rijnders developed further with the Deventer team.

In the meantime, Rijnders had gone from Go Ahead to Ajax for 400,000 guilders in 1969. In his first season, the central midfielder and ball picker became national champion and cup winner with Ajax. The following year, the Amsterdam team again won the cup. They also won the European Cup. Panathinaikos was defeated at Wembley. In this match, Rijnders suffered from tightness in his chest. He was replaced at half time by Horst Blankenburg. Rijnders played 63 league matches for Ajax in two seasons, in which he scored four times. Remarkably enough, the hard-working and well-functioning Rijnders left for FC Brugge in the summer of 1971 in Belgium, which offered him a better contract than Ajax wanted to give him. Later it was suggested that the Ajax board led by Jaap van Praag was aware of his heart problems and therefore made little effort to keep him for the Amsterdam club. 

Rijnders also did well in Bruges and had a permanent base place. The team played in the UEFA Cup. They finished second in the league, behind Anderlecht in the 1971–72 season. On 12 November 1972, Rijnders collapsed after ten minutes on the field during a home game against Club Liège. Rijnders was clinically dead. He was resuscitated in the catacombs by the then club doctor Michel D'Hooghe. He spent weeks in hospital. Later, he retired from professional football. He then became an assistant coach at Club Brugge.

In October 1968 he was first included in the selection of the Netherlands national team by national coach Georg Keẞler. He had previously played for the Dutch military team of coach Jan Zwartkruis. On April 16, 1969, he made his debut for the Orange squad, in a friendly against Czechoslovakia. Rijnders was a fixture in the Netherlands national team in 1969 and 1970 and appeared in eight international matches. After November 1970 he disappeared from the base under the new national coach František Fadrhonc.
In 1974 Rijnders became coach of the fourth division team Racing Harelbek. However, after new heart problems on Christmas Eve 1974, he was disqualified from all sports activities, including coaching. In July 1975, Ajax and Club Brugge organized a benefit match for Rijnders. Bruges was reinforced for the occasion with Johan Neeskens and Johan Cruijff played along with Ajax. The match ended in 3-0 for Bruges.

Rijnders also opened a sports shop in Bruges. The business soon went bankrupt. Rijnders' wife left him and is said to have had a drinking problem.
On March 3, 1976, he became unwell while celebrating carnival in Deventer. After a few days in a Deventer hospital he came to. Rijnders died on March 16, 1976, alone in Bruges, in his home above his old sports shop, from a heart condition. He was 28 years old. 

A cardiologist who treated Rijnders reported in 2009 on the basis of the medical file that the footballer suffered from congenital heart rhythm disorders. In 1976 these could not be determined and could not be remedied. 

In 2020, the municipality of Amsterdam named a bridge in Park de Meer after him.

Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts

On 30 September 2022, Vladimir Putin said that four Ukrainian oblasts would now be part of Russia. These are the oblasts Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. These oblasts make up about 15% of the territory of Ukraine. Before the annexation, the people were asked if they wanted to join Russia. Because this vote happened during a conflict, and was done by one of the parties involved in the conflict, it is against international law. Because of the conflict, much of the population had left.

This annexation is the largest in Europe, beating Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. It also made a land connection between Crimea and European Russia.

Because of the problems involved, no other state recognized this annexation except for North Korea. Ukraine, the European Union, the United States, and the United Nations have all said that the referendums and annexation had no legal basis or effect.

As a response to the annexation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would apply to join NATO.

The size of the territory annexed is about , comparable to the size of Hungary or Portugal.

On 27 September, Russian officials claimed that the annexation "referendum" in Zaporizhzhia Oblast passed, with 93.11% of voters in favour of joining the Russian Federation.

Another problem is that fighting is still ongoing, and Russian forces do not control all of the territory they claim they annexed.

A United Nations Security Council meeting was held on 30 September 2022 to vote on a resolution to punish Russia on annexation of these territories, resulting in 10 yes votes, 1 no vote and 4 abstentions. The resolution failed to pass due to Russia vetoing it. Brazil, China, Gabon, and India abstained from the vote.

On 7 August 2022, the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said that "if the occupiers proceed along the path of pseudo-referendums they will close for themselves any chance of talks with Ukraine and the free world, which the Russian side will clearly need at some point." After the ceremony of annexation, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would not negotiate with Russia "as long as Putin is president", and requested a "fast-track" NATO membership in response.

Post-Soviet states

The post-Soviet states are the 15 sovereign states that were union republics of the Soviet Union. They emerged from the Soviet Union after the dissolution in 1991.

They are also known as the former Soviet Union (FSU), the former Soviet Republics and in Russia as the near abroad.

Russia is the main "de facto" internationally recognized successor state to the Soviet Union after the Cold War. Ukraine has, by law, claimed that it is a state-successor of both the Ukrainian SSR and the Soviet Union which stayed under dispute over formerly Soviet-owned areas.<refOn Legal Succession of Ukraine, Articles 7 and 8.</ref>

The three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – were the first to declare their independence from the USSR, between March and May 1990. They claimed continuity from the original states which existed before the annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940. The remaining 12 republics all left after. All 12 of these republics joined the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and most of the 12 joining the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). However, the Baltic states focused on European Union (EU) and NATO membership. EU officials have made clear the importance of Association Agreements between the EU and post-Soviet states.

Many disputed states with varying degrees of recognition exist within the territory of the former Soviet Union. These are Transnistria in eastern Moldova, Abkhazia and South Ossetia in northern Georgia and Artsakh in southwestern Azerbaijan. Since 2014, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in far eastern Ukraine have claimed independence. All of these unrecognized states except Artsakh depend on Russian armed support and financial aid. Artsakh is part of Armenia at a "de facto" level, which also maintains close cooperation with Russia. Before its annexation by Russia in March 2014, which was not recognized by most countries, Crimea shortly declared itself an independent state.

The 15 states may be divided into four subregions. Not included in these categories are the several de facto independent states presently lacking international recognition (read below: Separatist conflicts).

Regarding political freedom in the former Soviet republics, Freedom House's 2021 report listed the following:


Similarly, the Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders in 2022 recorded the following for press freedom:


It has been said that several post-Soviet states did not change leadership for decades since their independence, such as Nursultan Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan until his surprise resignation in 2019, and Islam Karimov in Uzbekistan, until his death in September 2016. All of these had originally more limited terms but through decrees or referendums prolonged their stay in office (a practice also followed by Presidents Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus and Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan). Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan had served as President since its independence until he was forced to resign as a result of the Kyrgyz revolution of 2005. Saparmurat Niyazov in Turkmenistan ruled from independence until his death in 2006, creating a personality cult around himself. His successor, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, has kept a personality cult of his own that has replaced the worshipping of Niyazov.

The issue of dynastical succession has been another thing affecting the politics of some post-Soviet States. Heydar Aliyev, after creating an extensive and ongoing cult of personality, handed the Presidency of Azerbaijan to his son, Ilham Aliyev. Theories about the children of other leaders in Central Asia being groomed for succession abound. The participation of Akayev's son and daughter in the 2005 Kyrgyz parliamentary elections boosted fears of dynastic succession being used in Kyrgyzstan as well, and may have contributed to the anti-Akayev climate that led to his overthrow.

Economic, political, national, military, and social problems have all been reasons of separatism in the post-Soviet era. In many cases, problems because of reasons such as ethnic divisions existed before the fall of the Soviet Union, and upon the fall of the union were brought into the open. Such territories and resulting military conflicts have so far been:



Civil wars unrelated to separatist movements have occurred twice in the region:


Since 2003, a number of (largely) peaceful "colour revolutions" have happened in some post-Soviet states after disputed elections, with popular protests bringing into power the former opposition.

Belmont 112

Belmont 112  (also known as the Belmont Program) was a project attacking poverty in Philadelphia.  In 1987, philanthropist George Weiss began supporting 112 sixth-grade  girls and boys from  Belmont Elementary School in West Philadelphia.  He guaranteed them that  he would pay for their education through college if they met some conditions.  The conditions were  that they did not use drugs, commit any crimes or have children unless they were married.

In addition to paying for their college educations, Weiss's program supported the children by giving them tutors, counselors, after-school programs, and medical and dental care. 

The program was the first one of Weiss's Say Yes to Education, Inc. efforts.  Say Yes is a nonprofit set up to improve inner-city education.

The results were that twenty graduated from college, but 45 did not even finish high school.  In addition, twenty were convicted of crimes, and more than half of the girls had babies by the time they were eighteen years old. John McWhorter calls this a failure due to not considering cultural factors. Conservative commentator Larry Elder, saying that since the college-graduation rate for the group was not different from that of children with similar backgrounds but without pre-paid education, "The money was wasted." He said the reason for the failure was a problem of character. Thirty years after the project started, a CBS article said that Weiss "believes you can overcome poverty with education, but admits his expectations were probably unrealistic."

Clemuel Ricketts Mansion

The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion (also known as the Stone House, the William R. Ricketts House, and Ganoga) is a Georgian-style house. It was made of sandstone. It was built in 1852 or 1855 on the shore of Ganoga Lake in Sullivan County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It was home to several generations of the Ricketts family, which includes R. Bruce Ricketts and William Reynolds Ricketts. It was originally built as a hunting lodge. Also, it was a tavern and post office and it served as part of a hotel for much of the 19th century.

The house has seven rooms, four porches, and its original hardware and woodwork. Dormers and some windows were added in the renovation, and electrical wiring and modern plumbing have been added since. According to the NRHP nomination form, the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion "is a stunning example of Georgian vernacular architecture".

The mansion and lake are on a part of the Allegheny Plateau known as North Mountain. The plateau was formed about 300 to 250 million years ago in the Alleghenian orogeny. Rocks—gray sandstone with conglomerates and some siltstone—of the Mississippian Pocono Formation underlie the house and lake for more than 340 million years old. The lake is in a shallow valley, deep, which is seized by glacial till up to thick at the southeast end, where Kitchen Creek exits.

After the house was built, the land was first part of Northumberland County. Later it became part of Lycoming County in 1795. The Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike was built between 1822 and 1827. It followed the lake's western shore. It was connected the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The lake was then known as Long Pond, and the Long Pond Tavern, just north of where the house was later built, was a lunch stop for the stagecoach on the turnpike. Sullivan County was formed from Lycoming County in 1847, and two years later Colley Township was formed from Cherry Township.

The administrative centre (capital city) of the oblast is Blagoveshchensk. Blagoveshchensk is one of the oldest cities in the Russian Far East. It was founded in 1856. It is a center of trade and gold mining. Two major railways run through Amur Oblast. These are the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Baikal-Amur Mainline. As of the , the oblast's population was 830,103. 

Amur Krai () or Priamurye () were unofficial names for the Russian territories by the Amur River. They were used in the old Russian Empire.

Amur Oblast is in southeast Russia. It is between the Stanovoy Range in the north and the Amur River in the south. It borders the Sakha Republic in the north, Khabarovsk Krai and the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in the east, Chinese Heilongjiang in the south, and Zabaykalsky Krai in the west. 

Several mountain ranges rise to the south of Stanovoy Range. This includes the Selemdzha Range parallel to it, as well as the Ezop, Yam-Alin, and the Turan ranges.

Many rivers flow through the oblast, mainly in the north. This gives 75% of the hydropower resources in the Russian Far East. Most of the oblast is in the Amur River's drainage basin. The longest rivers in Amur Oblast include the Amur, Bureya, Gilyuy, Nyukzha, Olyokma, Selemdzha, and Zeya.

Amur Oblast has large reserves of many mineral resources. The proven resources are estimated to be worth US$400 billion. Some of the most important are gold (the largest amounts in Russia), silver, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, copper, iron, and tin. There are also an estimated 70 billion tons of black coal and lignite reserves.

The region has been home to many Mongolic peoples and the Manchus for millennia. It was settled by Russians through the 17th-19th centuries to the present. This growth of Russians was at its height during the building of the Trans-Siberian Railroad and after it was built.

Syrian opposition

The Syrian Opposition is an umbrella term for multiple anti-government forces present in Syria. These include different militias who's collective goal is the removal of the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and the ruling Ba'ath Party. Opposition groups in Syria took a new path in 2011 following the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. The conflict between the opposition forces and the government has resulted in numerous clashes where many human rights violations have taken place on both sides.

Syrian opposition groups started forming during the rule of Hafez al-Assad and the Ba’ath party. The Ba’ath party, which advocates for a unified Arab state based on pan-Arabism and , experienced internal divisions over issues such as the economy, foreign policy, and national unity, leading to the formation of military and civilian wings based on personal loyalty. The military wing emerged as the dominant force in Syria and played a significant role in Hafez al-Assad's rise to power. In February of 1982, Syrian government forces carried out a violent operation in the town of , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 30,000 Syrians over a 27-day period. This event, along with other reported human rights violations, spurred the emergence of opposition groups.

On July 7th, 2000 Bashar al-Assad inherited rule over Syria following the death of his father, Hafez al-Assad. The regime led by Bashar al-Assad and the Ba’ath party made promises of economic and political reforms, which have not yet been fully implemented. However, the lack of political freedoms and authoritarian way of ruling present during Hafez al-Assad’s rule continued with Bashar al-Assad.

In 2011, anti-government uprisings and protests inspired by the Arab Spring movements in Egypt and Tunisia took place in the city of Daraa, and later spread throughout the entire country. Shortly after, in 2012, a civil war was declared in Syria. As government militias continuously cracked down on protests with violence, and many detainees testified experiencing torture by government forces while detained, the formation of opposition groups has expanded due to the increase of anti-regime attitudes. More recently, Russian support has escalated the war. In 2015, Russia began providing weapons, ammunition, private military contractors, and war advisors to support the Syrian regime. Russia additionally commanded a series of areal strikes in Syria, specifically targeting Free Syrian Army- affiliated groups that receive US support.

After the start of the Syrian Uprisings and Civil War in 2011, the Free Syrian Army was established by a group of defected Syrian army officers with the goal of overthrowing the regime. came to be the figurehead of the group and called on officers and army personnel to defect and join the so-called ‘freedom fighters’.

There exist a number of opposition groups, also called rebel groups, many unified under the and the . The most wide-spread opposition militia is the Free Syrian Army (FSA). Many smaller opposition groups, such as (SDF) and the Syrian National Army (SNA) identify as members of the FSA, even though they aren’t officially a part of it, as the FSA has become a synonym for the armed/military wing of the Syrian people’s opposition to the regime. The term ‘Syrian opposition’, however, includes other non FSA affiliated groups, namely ISIL and (HTS) and certain . Most opposition groups are funded by the US, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

Although no single entity has full control, several Syrian opposition groups have a certain level of presence across seven governorates in Syria. The Idlib Governorate stands out as the location where the Opposition has most influence and control. It was taken over in 2011 by multiple opposition militias, starting with the FSA who targeted the Syrian Army, and in 2017 came under control of HTS. It is also the region where most clashes between Assad’s regime forces and rebel groups take place. Other locations that the rebel groups have or have had partial control over, as well as faced clashes with the Syrian Army, include the Northern Hama Province, Western and Eastern part of Daraa Governorate and the Aleppo Governorate. Additionally, in 2016, Syrian Opposition forces and Syrian government forces had nearly equal control over the Aleppo Governorate.

There have been numerous committed by the Syrian Opposition. According to the United Nations Human Rights Council, both government and anti-government forces use similar tactics and practices in order to reach their goal. Although differing in ideology, the opposition was reported to have committed 1996 detention-related human rights violations, consisting of torture, sexual violence, inhumane or degrading treatment and enforced disappearance, compared to the 3210 of those committed by the regime.

Some of these violations are mainly concerned with specific ethnic and/or religious groups, namely the SNA attacking people of Yazidi and Kurdish origin. 87% of the identified victims tortured and killed by the SNA military police and other related militias were of minority ethnic, religious or sectarian background.

Most of the violations committed by the groups Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and ISIL are linked to their interpretations of the Sharia law as well as fundamentalist religious ideologies the groups adhere to.

Vincent Dekker

Vincent Dekker is a retired Dutch investigative journalist of Dutch national newspaper "Trouw". 

Dekker wrote for newspaper "Trouw" for years about El Al Flight 1862. He wrote the book 'Going down going down' (1995). He participated in the documentary series 'Murky Skies' from Israelian documentary maker Noam Pinchas (2023). He advised and played a major role in the drama series Rampvlucht (2022), documentary Rampvlucht (2022) and podcast series Rampvlucht (2022).

In his view many things were wrong in the official investigation of the plane crash. He was opposed and even ridiculed during his research by multiple people and organizations and even colleagues. However, he continued his research on unanswered questions and continued writing about it. Partly because of his works, a parliamentary inquiry was launched in 1998. Up till now (2023) Dekker has not been able to solve any of the so called 'Bijlmer mysteries' from the past 30 years. Dekker has requested politicians to initiate the release of all files regarding the accident investigation from 1992 to the public, so that further research can be done.

On 4 October 1992, an Israeli cargo plane crashed in the Amsterdam Bijlmer: El Al Flight 1862. 

On the basis of eye witness information Dekker started to reconstruct the crash from the 4th of October 1992. He published several articles in the daily newspaper Trouw. He raised questions about the crash and the investigation. He wrote that a water landing in a lake close to Amsterdam would have been a better decision by the crew that would have resulted in less casualties. He opposed the aviation experts that the main cause of the crash would have been a failure of the engine suspension system of the Boeing 747.

Dekker was supported in his own investigation by the ´Werkgroep Vliegverkeer Bijlmermeer´ to answer unanswered and unexplained questions. The Werkgroep was founded in November 1992, a month after the crash. The Werkgroep objected against the intensity of the air traffic over dense populated areas around Schiphol Airport. Dekker concluded on the basis of his own information that events contributing to the cause of the crash could not have developed as communicated by the officials during the accident investigation.

His articles caused concern at the level of the investigation board, Dutch politics and the Israelian government. They feared that the public might already jump to conclusions on the basis of daily newspaper articles before a thourough investigation could be done. Usually an investigation could take months or even years. He was opposed and even ridiculed during his research by people and organisations and even colleague journalists. Two years after the publication of the final accident report by the Dutch Aviation Safety Board (Raad voor de Luchtvaart) according ICAO Annex 13 at 24th of February 1994 (source x), Dekker published his book 'Going down Going down' (1995). With this book Dekker published his opinion about the true reason for the crash and how it could have been prevented.

Mainly because of his articles, from the mid of 1993 questions not directly related to the cause of the accident (such as airplane cargo, unidentified 'men in white suits' and health issues in the Bijlmermeer) started to play a major role in the Dutch media. Dekker started a co-operation with other journalists (mr Pierre Heijboer from the Volkskrant, Mr Joost Oranje from NRC and Rob de Lange from Zembla). He also developed connections with Mr. Rob van Gijzel, a Dutch Parliament Member that believed Dekker's version of events. Since frequent publications and questions kept coming up about dangers resulting from unrecoverd depleted uranium balance weights and cargo chemical substances that could have been a basis for developing nerve gasses in Israel, a Parliament Enquiry was launched in 1998. 

Dekker wrote about the following themes: the cockpit voice recorder which was never recovered; inaccurate and incomplete statements made by the Minister the day after the accident that mainly flowers and perfume were on board as cargo; incomplete airway bills. Also Dekker concluded that the route of the aircraft according the radar data would not match with the route registered in the DFDR. Some of his eye witnesses had seen the aircraft at other locations than the authorities had shown on maps. It must be stated that the set of complete DFDR data has never been publicly released because of ICAO 13 accident investigation requirements. However, the outcome of the DFDR data in the form of a plot has been published in the accident report. It must also be stated that a number of eye witnesses disagreed with the position of the aircraft as assumed by Dekker's witnesses. This came to light during the public hearing of the Dutch Safety Board in The Hague in October 1993.

In the aftermath of the disaster many Bijlmer residents felt ill. The residents linked their health complaints with the crash of the airplane. There was social unrest because of this.This social unrest continued up to 1998 when a parliament enquiry was initiated.

With the parliament enquiry in 1999 a great number of questions and possible complot theories were addressed and answered. The conclusions and findings of the final report of the enquiry were accepted by the Dutch parliament. However, political consequences were rejected and the government coalition continued to exist. Dekker, together with his colleague Heijboer and Mr. van Gijzel strongly disagreed with the outcome of the process of the enquiry and all were disappointed that no one at political level took responsibility.

In 2004 Dr. P. Vasterman, media-sociologist and assistent professor at the Amsterdam University - wrote a dissertation about the relation between media hypes and health issues in the aftermath of disasters (bron: 'Ziek van de ramp of van het nieuws over de ramp?). He proved a relationship between social unrest in the Bijlmer and the publications in the Dutch media. Also Dutch journalists had an internal discussion about the way that they had handled the newspaper publications during and after the Bijlmer accident to answer the question if they had truthfully and reliably informed the public. An article was published in 'De groene Amsterdammer'.

Despite the clarifications and evidences given in the report of the Parliament Enquiry in 1999, Dekker stated in the updated version of his book 'Going down going down' (2022) that 'all the facts that he concluded in 1995' remained valid. The new edition of his book was published simulteneously with the start of the drama serie Rampvlucht from KRO-NCRV at the 30 year commemmoration of the crash. Dekker played an essential role in the drama series, the documentary and the podcast series, and advised the scenario writer Michael Leendertse with his vision on the crash.

During his journalistic investigations Dekker was confronted with authorities, politicians and individual experts and even colleague journalists who did not agree with his view and analyses about the accident.

In 2023 Mr. Henk Pruis, who was an accident investigator in the team of the Dutch Aviation Safety Board in 1992 and 1993 and who publicly testified under oath in the parliament enquiry in 1999, reviewed the 2022 version of Dekker's book. He wrote that Dekker has not seen all the evidences related to the aircraft crash, i.e. all Digital Flight Data Recorder data, the factual finding reports of the damage to all engines and the aircraft and detailed expert analyses and reports. This may have contributed to Dekker's poorly and questionably substantiated conclusion that there would have been a cover-up at the level of the accident investigation and/or even at government level. He also concluded that Mr. Dekker is very selective in the testimonies of his witnesses and of other events in the aviation history that he uses to substantiate his views. In his opinion Dekker's book is not a balanced review of the accident investigation process and its aftermath. Evenso, essential journalist mistakes have been made working towards the conclusion that the authorities would have covered-up the events (i.e. insufficient checking and not showing respect). The release of all accident files allocated at the National Archives would show that there was nothing to hide.

Partly due to Dekker's publications a parliament enquiry into the disaster started in 1998, however, a cover-up at government level could not be proven. The public perception in 2023 is divided, but on social media it can be seen that many people believe Dekker's version of the truth.

Dekker himself was suspiscious that he was being followed by the Israelian secret service, although this could never be proven. He was ridiculed and and even considered a conspiracy theorist. He later was labeled as an influential journalist (number 22 on a list of 100 influential journalists).

Dekker is one of the founding members of the (VVOJ) in 2002. A journalists association to stimulate investigative journalism and improve the media climate for investigative journalism.

Self-care

Self-care is the process of taking care of your own health on a physical and psychological level. These include diet, sleep, personal hygiene, social interactions, exercise and recreation. Regular self-care is important for healthy people in terms of health promotion. It only becomes essential (necessary) in the case of physical and psychological complaints and illnesses in terms of prevention and maintaining quality of life. 

Although the name suggests its origin in modern times, the origins can be traced back to Socrates in ancient Greece. Before the 20th century , self-care was still closely tied to wealth . It was not until that time that the middle class was able to afford it. With the release of "Caring for Yourself." 1986 by Michel Foucault , the topic is taken up again in another way. The aim (goal) is to get to know yourself there, to identify mistakes and harmful behavior in order to eliminate or change them. 

There are many factors that support self-care, including:

competency-based approaches to building self-care skills
routine 

The hindering factors are factors that stabilize a lack of self-care or make improvement more difficult:

Skipper Clement

Klemen Andersen "Skipper Clement" (Around 1484 – 9 September 1536) was a Danish merchant, captain, privateer. He was also the leader of the peasant rebellion that was part of the civil war known as the Count's Feud (Grevens Fejde).

Clement was born to a farmer family in Aaby parish (Aaby Sogn in Kjer Herred) in the district of Vendsyssel in North Jutland. He became a merchant in Aalborg and later captain and vice admiral in the navy of King Christian II of Denmark.

On 16 October 1534 the peasant army of Clement, re-enforced with professional soldiers from Count Christoffer, met the army of the Jutland nobility that had been sent to crush the revolt. King Christian III of Denmark made a separate peace with Count Christoffer and his general Johan Rantzau was freed to fight the peasant revolt. In December 1534, the army of Johan Rantzau defeated the peasant army which had retreated to Aalborg and strengthened the defences of the city. After a hard battle, Rantzau's army overcame the defences and killed as many as 2,000 people.

As the last active, and maybe most famous and important peasant rebel in Danish history he might be viewed as a Danish parallel of Wat Tyler in England, Thomas Muntzer in Germany and Yemelyan Pugachev in Russia.

She was a pioneer, being one of the earliest Dutch female fencers. Her fencing career was from 1911 to 1921 and competed in the highest level competitions in that era winning several prizes. As captain of the Dutch team, she became the first international Dutch female fencer in 1911 at the 1911 England–Holland women's fencing competitions together with the four other Dutch competitors.

Beelaerts van Blokland was born on 15 June 1886 in The Hague as a member of the Beelaerts van Blokland family, an old Dutch patrician family. She held the noble title of jonkvrouw. Her father was policitian Gerard Beelaerts van Blokland and her mother was editor . She had one older sister and had five brothers, including politicians Frans Beelaerts van Blokland, and .

Beelaerts van Blokland was a fencer at Salle De Vos in The Hague. She was one of the earliest female fencers in the Netherlands. Together with four other females of Salle De Vos (H. Luden, C. van Doorn, E. van den Bergand H. van den Berg) she went to London, United Kingdom for the 1911 England–Holland women's fencing competitions. Beelaerts van Blokland was the captain of the Dutch team. In Londen they competed against female fencers of the Bertrands Fencing Academy. This was the first international fencing competition for Dutch women. The ladies fenced well, but lost as a team both on 16 March and 17 March from the British team that included British champion Millicent Hall and Julia Johnstone. A week later, after coming back in the Netherlands, she had a match against C. van Doorn during a main fencing event in The Hague.

While there was the international competition in London 1911, it was two years later a first national women’s fencing competition was held. Female fencers from Breda and The Hague competed against each other in the 1913 Breda–The Hague women's fencing competition on 27 April 1913. In this competition Beelaerts van Blokland won the second prize, losing from T. van de Berg, also of Salle De Vos. Soon after this first cometition she took her revanche.

In 1914 it was pointed out that Beelaerts van Blokland had like the other fencers of Salle De Vos another fencing style compared to Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo of Salle Giandomenici from Amsterdam. Her "graceful pullings" were described as opposite to the style of Bekkers-Lopes Cardozodescribed that was described as “more lively, more fiery and less different from the men's technique”.

Beelaerts van Blokland married in 1926 at the age of 40 to Willem Hendrik Warnsinck. Beelaerts van Blokland had the nickname “Tante Juul” (translated: aunt Juusje). In 1928 they had a stillborn son N. N. Warnsinck. After the death of her husband, she died in Wassenaar on 11 July 1981 at the age of 95. She was burried on 16 July 1981 in Wassenaar.

The Rhydd is a big old house in Worcestershire, England. It is in a park with trees and it is on a hill over the River Severn. It used to be called Rhydd Court. The house is now used for people who need care. The gardens are closed most days and people cannot see them.

The name "Rhydd" may have come from the colour "red" of the earth nearby where people went from one side of the River Severn to the other.

The house was built about 1800. It was very easy to see the big building from the other side of the river. There were trees near the house. It was a good place to take fish from the river. People liked the views from the house very much.

There was more building in 1863.

Ghezo

Ghezo was a king of the Dahomey in Benin in the 19th Century. After Ghezo’s father Agonglo died, Ghezo’s brother Adandozan became king. In 1818, Adandozan jailed Francisco Félix de Souza, a slave trader from Brazil but de Souza escaped and made a deal with Ghezo to launch a coup d’état to force Adandozan to abdicate. Officially, Ghezo was regent for Adandozan’s son Dakpo but then in 1838, Ghezo declared his own son Glele heir apparent. Dakpo and Adandozan decided to fight Ghezo to change this and the fight started a fire which killed Dakpo making Ghezo official king of Dahomey.

An empire called the Oyo had had the Dahomey pay taxes to them every year since 1730. Then in 1823, Ghezo refused to pay the tax the Oyo wanted. When the Oyo sent an ambassador to Ghezo to change his mind, Ghezo killed him. The Oyo then went to war with Ghezo and the Kingdom of Dahomey. Ghezo defeated and killed the Oyo leader Ajanaku and won the war.

After beating the Oyo, Ghezo created his own empire which was based on slavery. Ghezo had people captured and enslaved so to escape him people ran away to a place called the city of Abeokuta. Ghezo started to wage war against Abeokuta to get slaves. 

Then in 1849, a man named William Winniett from the British Empire sent someone named Frederick Forbes to Ghezo to convince King Ghezo to end the slave trade. Ghezo ignored this and went back to attacking Abeokuta. After he lost in 1852, Ghezo decided to ban the slave trade but he went back to the wars against Abeokuta in 1858.

Because the British Empire wanted the Dahomey to end the slave trade it was a major controversy. One faction known as the Fly faction said that the Dahomey should end the slave trade like the British wanted. But King Ghezo and the Elephant faction said that they should keep the slave trade. Ghezo wanted to continue to sell slaves to Francisco Félix de Souza. In 1852, Ghezo still signed a treaty with the British Empire to end the slave trade. But in 1857, Ghezo brought it back.

In 1859, Ghezo died, either of smallpox or because he was killed by his enemies and his son Glele replaced him as king.

William Winniett

Sir William Robert Wolseley Winniet was a British Governor who was born in Nova Scotia and died in Ghana. Winniet was known for his efforts to end the slave trade in West Africa.

When Winniett was 21 he started to fight for the British Empire against the United States in the War of 1812 under the command of Sir Alexander Cochrane who offered to grant freedom to any slaves who were willing to fight for the British Empire against the United States in the War of 1812. Winniett finished fighting under Cochrane’s command when he was 22.

When Winniett was 25 years old, he was sent to Africa to try to end the slave trade. 

Winniett was a commander in the British Royal Navy trying to end the slave trade in Africa. And he continued this until 1842. 

In 1845, Winniett was appointed Governor of the Gold Coast which is now Ghana. In 1847, Winniett went to what is now Benin to try to convince the people there to end the slave trade. In 1848, Winniett used the West India Regiment to overthrow a king named Kwaku Akka. Winniett then tried to convince King Ghezo of the Dahomey to stop the Dahomey slave trade and ban human sacrifice. Winniett also bought the Dutch fortresses on the West African coast so that he could end the Dutch slave trade.

In 1849, Winniett was knighted by Queen Victoria. 
Winniett died in Ghana in 1850.

Public perception of mathematics

Public perception of mathematics includes the way in which people (not just mathematicians) perceives mathematics, and the public opinion of this science.

The manner of public perception of mathematics is significant for many reasons, especially those related to education and social issues. In Italy, as in other European countries, the public perception of mathematics is negative and full of prejudice often related to how it is taught.

Mathematics education plays a key role in the public perception of mathematics. The abstract part of mathematics makes the student feel to be bad at mathematics, while others see mathematics as hard and for "intelligent people". On these, Terence Tao tried to answer to the question "does one have to be a genius to do mathematics?" saying no.

Several groups have tried to change or improve the public perception of mathematics:

In France, "Animath" changes the public perception of mathematics in France. "MathsWorldUK" tries to transform the United Kingdom public's perception of mathematics.

C. van Doorn

Jkvr. C. van Doorn (born c. 1880s — died 20th-century) was a Dutch fencer. As a fencer at Salle De Vos in The Hague she was a pioneer, being one of the earliest Dutch female fencers. Her fencing career was from 1911 to 1919. She became the first international Dutch female fencer in 1911 at the 1911 England–Holland women's fencing competitions together with the four other Dutch competitors.

Van Doorn was born in the late 19th-century in c. 1880s. She held the noble title of jonkvrouw.

Van Doorn was a fencer at Salle De Vos in The Hague of professor J. De Vos. She was one of the earliest female fencers in the Netherlands. Together with four other females of Salle De Vos (H. Luden, Beelaerts van Blokland, E. van den Berg and H. van den Berg) she went to London, United Kingdom for the 1911 England–Holland women's fencing competitions. In Londen they competed against female fencers of the Bertrands Fencing Academy. This was the first international fencing competition for Dutch women. Van Doorn was the best Dutch fencer. She won four of her five matches and won from among the 1908-1909 British champion Millicent Hall. However, the Dutch team lost from the British team. A week later, after coming back in the Netherlands, she had a match against Beelaerts van Blokland during a main fencing event in The Hague.

At the end of 1913 she went with four other Dutch women to the international 1913 Alfred Hutton Memorial Challenge Cup in London. Van Doorn was eliminated in the first round. She was in her pool beaten by British fencers Alice Walker and Jean Colmer.

As part of the celebration of the new hall of Giovanni Giandomenici, a fencing academy in Amsterdam, she participated in an assaut in February 1914. During the 1914 club championships of salle De Vos she fenced remarkably beautiful matches.

In March 1917 she won the third prize in a national competition in The Hague, behind Beelaerts van Blokland and Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo. In April 1918 she competes at the national competition in Amsterdam. 

Probably her last main competition was in April 1919. This was a competition between three main Dutch women fencing clubs (De Vos, Van Humbeek, Giandomenici). 

In 1914 it was pointed out that Van Doorn had like the other fencers of Salle De Vos another fencing style compared to Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo of Salle Giandomenici from Amsterdam. Her "graceful pullings" were described as opposite to the style of Bekkers-Lopes Cardozodescribed that was described as “more lively, more fiery and less different from the men's technique”.

It was held at Salle Van Humbeek in Amsterdam on 25 March 2019. Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo became the first official champion without losing a match. C. Crena de Jongh finished second and Ina Santhagens-Waller finished third.

The championship was one of the earliest women's official national sport championship in the Netherlands. For instance, the first Netherlands women’s athletics championships were held in 1921.

In 1911 women fencers of Salle De Vos competed internationally at the 1911 England–Holland women's fencing competitions. A first Dutch national competition was held between fencers of Breda against The Hague at the 1913 Breda–The Hague women's fencing competition. Before the excistance of the national fencing federation the organization of fencing competitions by the fencing houses. Salle Giandomenici organised even an international fencing competition in 1914. Untill 1919 unofficial national championships were held, but which were more like mutual competitions. In 1919, the Dutch fencing federation had taken the lead to organize an annual official women's national fancing championship.

Of the entrants, ten participated at this championship. The number of participants was low compared to the previous unofficial national championships when there were nineteen participants. The participants were from Salle De Vos from The Hague and Salle Giandomenici from Amsterdam. The only entrant from Salle Humbeek, M. J. J. van Heukelom, withdrawn.

Many of the participants were known fencer of that era like: Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo, Ina Santhagens-Waller and Julia Beelaerts van Blokland. A newcomer was a very young fencer, the 16 years old A. C. Fruin from Rotterdam.
The name in "italic" entered for the competition, but didn't compete.

The fencers competed in one group in the competition format, meaning each fencer competed once against every other fencer. So each fencer competed against each of the other nine fencers.

Several women with fencing experience disappointed. Julia Beelaerts van Blokland is mentioned in particular who disappointed. While already fenced for years, no progress was visible according to De Telegraaf. She lost against the Fruin with 3–1. Despite the young age of Fruin, it was described she fenced very “creditably”. The match with the best fencing quality was the match of Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo against Ina Santhagens-Waller. Bekkers won the match in a “beautiful” way with 3–0. 

Like the year before, Bekkers won the championship. She won all her nine matches. C. Crena de Jongh finished second. Santhagens-Waller, who finished second the previous year, had after all matches the same score as Fruin. A decisive match took place. It was won by Santhagens-Waller with 3–1 and so finished third with Fruin ending in fourth place.

Homestuck

Homestuck is a story on the internet made of pictures, words, and videos. Andrew Hussie released Homestuck from 2009 to 2016. The story is about four children who start playing a video game that causes the end of the world.

Homestuck has over 8000 online pages and 800,000 words. It is a webcomic, but also uses animations, music, and video games. People in the comic often time travel to the past or the future. This creates many possible or imagined stories that all happen at the same time.

At first, Hussie wanted his fans (people who are interested in something) to make the choices for the story. He later decided that this was too complicated, so he made more of the choices himself. Many fans wrote their ideas for Homestuck on blogs and internet forums. Hussie sometimes added these ideas to the story. Fans also made a lot of the artwork and music for the comic. In 2012, Hussie said that he was in control of the comic, but he was not in control of the "movement" of Homestuck.

Homestuck was very popular, especially among teenagers. About a million people came to the website each day. Fans gave over 2 million dollars on Kickstarter to make a video game for the story.

Trudlerbaach

The Trudlerbaach is a small river which flows through the communes of Contern and Weiler-la-Tour in Luxembourg.

The Trudlerbaach has existed in it’s current course for at least 3000 years. The first crossing over the river was built in the Roman era when one of the main routes between Luxembourg and Trier was constructed. It linked the towns of Luxembourg and Dalheim together as at the time Contern wasn’t a settlement. The first settlement on the river was Syren which was constructed around the 16th-17th century. Locals witnesses the fresh waterspring in the settlement. The existence of the stream was the reason for the naming of the nearby rue de la source. At the time the spring was used for drinking water. Over time the area around the steam was converted into farmland creating fields like the Klappwissen and the Sauerfeld. It is possible that the Trudlerbaach once flowed from the Pettengerbesch as other streams are sources there. However the development of land and construction of new roads prevented all the groundwater from converging into one stream. The resulted in the tributaries from the Roulend and northern Shältgen. Water then collected directly underneath one trail which created Lac Beriton. 1996 Faerscthaff was constructed on the banks of the stream, and then expanded in 2001. Then Trudlermillen was constructed in 2010. No major developments have been constructed on the banks of the river and development in Contern could fill in Lac Beriton and cut the river back to Op der Syrener Head and make the inflows from the source to be exclusively storm drains.

The Trudlerbaach begins in a small pond in the Schältgen forest which is right next to a small weir, next to that weir there is a smaller pond which feeds the larger one. There are other inflows into the pond however. The pond is directly south of a pathway which has a storm drain on either side of it. One one the south side of the road flows directly into the pond. Additionally the primary inflow into the lake is through a culvert underneath the road. 3 small inflows merge before flowing through the culvert. One being the storm drain on the north side of the road which starts in Shaltend. The other 2 inflows are natural watercourses. One runs from the north-eastern Corner of the Shältgen to the pond roughly following the border of the Shaltgen. The other watercourse stems from the previous one directly above the culvert and the other storm drain spur. Other smaller watercourses exist flowing out of the main one in the Shaltgen however all are intermittent and exceptionally small. One such stream provides a small link between a large pond and this river.This one runs through the northern Sauerfeld directly through the fields. Although not watered all the time, it has forged a path over where it runs. The exact place where the watercourse starts is unknown but it starts at a higher altitude compared to the other inflows and therefore is the highest source of the Trudlerbaach. 

To the South of Lac Beriton the Trudlerbaach begins narrow flowing through a narrow channel at the border of the Schältgen. It is next to a small unpaved pathway which marks the border between the Sauerfeld and the Schälgen. Eventually it flows towards Beriton and crosses under a pathway used for access to the shooting lodge through a culvert. Further south the Trudlerbaach nears the southern end of the Shältgen and begins to broaden and deepen. The river flows much slower relative to just south of Lac Beriton. Eventually the river narrows once more and becomes very shallow to the point where the water ripples as it flows. By this point the river has left the Shältgen and now forges the border between the Sauerfeld and am Grond. Eventually the path it has been parallel to ends and the river flows directly through one of the fields in the Sauerfeld. At the end of the path, the stream crosses directly under a fence dividing plots of land. The Trudlerbaach soon after begins to split into several small channels separated by large sedge plants and at one point the path of the stream forges and island. Further south the Trudlerbaach crosses through another culvert which links a field in the Southern Sauerfeld and am Grond.

The Trudlerbaach soon after flows south to meet Rue de Prés wherein a storm drain flows into the stream. The drain has seen construction to filter out sewage to prevent polution of the river further downstram and prevent flooding. The Trudlerbaach then flows west through the path named Faerschthaff which was formerly a part of Rue de Prés. The river forges the border between the road and the Bei der Bëtsenheck field. The Trudlerbaach later flows underneath the Fearschthaff road and through the Iwwert der Suelwiss locality and just south of Faerschthaff farm aswell as the Am ale Weier locality. From there the Stream passes directly South of Faerschthaff and enters a small collection of trees from where another small storm drain.

The Trudlerbaach passes underneath what is now a farming bridge however was once a part of one of the main roads between Luxembourg and Trier during the Roman Times, directly before crossing this bridge, the river sharply changes direction and flows west as opposed to south which was how it flowed through the row of trees before it. The stream then encounters some stepping stones as it traverses the locality of op de Syrener-head. Following this the stream crosses under another farming bridge before encountering the Poteschbesch. Upon reach the edge of the forest, the brook passes through an array of scattered stepping stones. Throughout most of the rivers traversing of the Poteschbesch, it forms the boundary between the forest and fields used for farming although a small handful of trees are almost always on the north bank.. Around the same location where the river enters the forest, the stream crosses the border between the communes of Contern and Weiler-La-Tour.

The Trudlerbaach has several inflows. Most of them are manmade Storm drain and intermittent stream however there is one permanently watered brook which flows into the Trudlerbaach in the North of Syren

The Intermittent brook which flows from the Shältgen begins at a small intermittent pond near the North-Eastern corner of the Shältgen. This pond is fed through direct precipitation as well as channels which flow from the fields around the Shältgen such as Am Säitert. The stream then flows on the border between the Shältgen and Am Säitert. There are several islands formed by rock along the way. As the stream aproaches An De Steng, it becomes mostly unwatered in an area where the river bed consists of wet sand and clay.Further south, a brook which obtains water from Am Säitert and Roulend flows into this stream, then followed by a storm drain which follows An De Steng. Then the stream flows through a culvert underneath An De Steng into Lac Beriton.

The Gaardebaach is a intermittent tribuatary of the Trudlerbaach which runs from the Gaardebesch north west of Contern to Am Grond where it reaches the Trudlerbaach. The stream flows south into the Ostrich farm and then flows though bushes onto the unpaved area of Beim Schmilberbour. The stream recieves water from Further up Beim Schmilberbour as well as 2 others from the ostrich farm.

The Xandirinne is the only natural, non-intermittent tributary of the Trudlerbaach. It flows from the Southern end of Trudlermillen to where is meets the Trudlerbaach around Moschelton. The Stream begins at a pond/collection of ponds at the Southern end of Trudlermillen, directly below the southernmost house in the area. From there the river starts narrow and meanders towards a dense forrest. In an area underneath a canopy of fallen trees the river becomes wider and deeper, there is a small natural dam which causes this. Directly north of the dam, a small intermittent tributary flows into the Xandirinne from the east. Further South the stream narrows once more before 2 small intermittent brook flow into it. From there, the stream widens and meanders through a cutting and goes through a lot of vegetation. Finally one more brook flows into it. While it is intermittent, there are 3 ponds which help form it which aren’t. Eventually, the river narrows again and flows into the Trudlerbaach. The stream has been undocumented until recently and does not appear on many maps.

Felix Hess

Felix Hess (1941 – 10 October 2022) was a Dutch artist with with a background in physics.

Born in The Hague, Hess studied physics at the University of Groningen from 1959 to 1967. He obtained his PhD cum laude in 1975 for a groundbreaking study into aerodynamics and movement of boomerangs, which until then had only been subject to cultural research. 

Between 1975 and 1979, Hess worked as a mathematician at the University of Adelaide in Australia. During that period, Hess was inspired by the communication of bullfrogs. Later he 'translated' his findings into moving, interacting sound devices and made presentations with them in galleries and later also museums. Sound animals he build, like bullfrogs, made sounds and responded to each other, but became silent as soon as they detected other unknown sounds. Hess has built various installations related to nature, interaction, senses and silence.

Hess had an installation art exhibition at the in Groningen in 1999. He transformed the pavilion into a large interactive lantern that reacted to air fluctuations. In 2018, Hess repeated this, but now filled the pavilion with 4000 teddy bears.

Hess won the for his works in 2003. The jury described Hess as an artist who "reopens our senses and makes us stand still in wonder". In March 2022, Hess received a certificate and medal from the Czech Minister of Culture for his donation to the National Gallery Prague of his collection of Japanese Zen paintings.

Hess died in Haren, his residence, on 10 October 2022, aged 81.

Proof of personhood

Proof of personhood (PoP) is a means of resisting bad attacks on peer to peer networks, particularly, attacks that use many fake identities. Decentralized online platforms are especially easy to be harmed by such attacks because of their architecture.

Proof of space

Proof-of-space (PoSpace), also termed "proof-of-capacity" (PoC), is a way of expressing interest in a service (e.g. email service) by using a big amount of memory or disk space to solve a problem, presented by the service provider.

This concept was first formulated in 2013 by Polish expert Stefan Dzembowski. The principle is similar to the term "proof-of-work".

The method is based on the use of free space on a file storage device (for example, a hard disk), previously allocated by users, rather than computing power for mining cryptocurrencies, which is a less energy-consuming method and, most importantly, an economical alternative to the classic method of mining digital currencies.

Hard disk mining is different in that you don't need to buy expensive video cards, high-power power supplies, and motherboards with a huge number of connectors to get the job done. To earn on HDD, a simple laptop with standard parameters and a built-in video card is enough. However, the requirements for disk characteristics are increasing.

Proof-of-time

Proof-of-time (PoT) is a blockchain consensus mechanism based on selecting validators in proportion to their ranking scores and a fixed stake. The algorithm gives each validator a score based on its historical experience and other validators’ experience with the node.

Proof-of-time (PoT) is a consensus protocol that uses a “self-selection voting mechanism” based on a verifiable delay function (VDF) to choose validators and focuses on how long the validator has been accurate and active within the network. The PoT mechanism is performed in two stages, namely soft and hard voting.

Proof of stake

Proof of Stake (PoS for short) is a process that a blockchain network uses to reach a consensus about which participant is allowed to generate the next block. A weighted random selection is used, whereby the weights of the individual participants are determined based on the duration of participation and/or assets (the "stake"). In contrast to the Proof of Work used with Bitcoin, Proof of Stake does not require time- and energy-intensive mining and it is not possible to take over the network simply by owning computing power ("51% attack").

The Super Mario Bros. Movie

The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a 2023 American computer-animated adventure comedy movie directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic and produced by Chris Meledandri of Universal Pictures, and by Illumination and Nintendo.

The movie was released in the United States on April 5, 2023. It received mixed reviews from critics, while reviews from the audience were mostly positive.

Italian-American brothers Mario and Luigi have recently opened a plumbing business in Brooklyn, to the derision of their ex-employer Spike and the disapproval of their father. After seeing a significant water main leak on the news, Mario and Luigi go underground to fix it but are sucked into a Warp Pipe and separated.

Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by Princess Peach, while Luigi arrives in the Dark Lands, ruled by the evil Koopa king Bowser. Bowser seeks to marry Peach and will destroy the Mushroom Kingdom using a Super Star if she refuses. He imprisons Luigi to threaten Mario, whom he sees as competition for Peach's love. Mario meets Toad, who takes him to Peach. Peach plans to ally with the primate Kongs to help repel Bowser and allows Mario and Toad to travel with her. She also tells Mario that she ended up in the Mushroom Kingdom as a baby, where the Toads took her in and eventually made her their leader. In the Jungle Kingdom, King Cranky Kong agrees to help if Mario defeats his son, Donkey Kong, in a fight. Despite Donkey Kong's immense strength, Mario defeats him using a Cat Suit.

Mario, Peach, Toad, and the Kongs use karts to drive back to the Mushroom Kingdom, but Bowser's army ambushes them on Rainbow Road. When a blue-shelled Koopa General destroys part of the road in a kamikaze attack, Mario and Donkey Kong plummet to the ocean while the other Kongs are captured. Peach and Toad return to the Mushroom Kingdom and urge the citizens to evacuate. Bowser arrives aboard his flying castle and proposes to Peach, who reluctantly accepts after Bowser's advisor Kamek tortures Toad. Mario and Donkey Kong, having been eaten by an eel-like Maw-Ray, learn they both want the respect of their fathers. They escape the Maw-Ray by riding a rocket from Donkey Kong's kart and hurry to Bowser and Peach's wedding.

At the wedding ceremony, Bowser intends to execute all of his prisoners in lava in Peach's honor. Toad smuggles an Ice Flower into Peach's bouquet, which she uses to freeze Bowser. Mario and Donkey Kong arrive and free the prisoners, with Mario using a Tanooki Suit to save Luigi. Bowser frees himself and summons a Bomber Bill to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom, but Mario knocks it off course and directs it into the Warp Pipe, where it detonates, creating a vacuum that causes everyone and Bowser's castle to be transported to Brooklyn. Mario attempts to grab the Star but is violently assaulted by the enraged Bowser, who also swiftly defeats Peach, Toad and Donkey Kong. Mario is encouraged by his advert to stand up and face Bowser, who almost incinerates him. Luigi saves Mario, with both grabbing the Super Star. They defeat the Koopas, destroy Bowser's castle and incapacitate Bowser. Peach then shrinks Bowser with a Blue Mushroom and imprisons him. Mario and Luigi are hailed as heroes by Brooklyn's populace, including their parents and Spike. Afterwards, the brothers move to a house in the Mushroom Kingdom and begin a day of plumbing work together.


On September 23, 2021, a teaser poster was released following the cast announcement. On October 4, 2022, another teaser poster was released featuring Mario in the Mushroom Kingdom. On October 6, 2022, a teaser trailer was released. The teaser shows Bowser and Kamek fighting penguins, Mario arriving in the Mushroom Kingdom, and Luigi being chased by Dry Bones. Black and Key were praised for their roles as Bowser and Toad while Pratt was heavily criticized for sounding too similar to his regular voice. 

On November 28, 2022, another teaser poster featuring Peach's Castle was released. The next day, a trailer was released online. The trailer shows Mario losing a fight to Donkey Kong, Peach rallying the Toads for a battle against Bowser, who is seemed to have kidnapped Luigi, Mario training on a Super Mario-themed course, and many characters racing on Rainbow Road. During the 2022 Game Awards, a clip was released. The clip features Toad showing Mario around the Mushroom Kingdom. Pratt's performance in the clip seemed to get better. 

On January 29, 2023, a new ad was released. The ad features Cat Mario and Rogen's voice for Donkey Kong. 

On February 3, 2023, an official poster for the film was released featuring the Rainbow Road track from the second trailer, the cast of characters, Peach's Castle, and the Dark Lands. 3 days later, a promo for the film featuring Mario constantly going through the pipes was released on the film's Twitter account. More new posters featuring Mario, Luigi, and Peach were released the following days before an ad for the Super Mario Bros. Plumbing company was released on February 12, followed by more new posters featuring Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Toad.

Mid vowel

A mid vowel (or a true-mid vowel) is a class of vowels used in some spoken languages. The tongue is placed midway between an open vowel and a close vowel.

Other names are lowered close-mid vowel and raised open-mid vowel. The first phrase may be used to describe a vowel as low as open-mid. And the other one could also be used to describe a vowel as high as close-mid.

Lunar year

A lunar year (used in some calendars) of 12 synodic months (12 cycles of lunar phases) is about 354 days long. A cosmic year is the time (about 225 million years) needed for the solar system to revolve once around the centre of the Milky Way.

Firing a worker was very expensive and hard. Previous unions, like the anarchist CNT and the socialist UGT, were outlawed and driven underground. Joining the OSE was required for all employed citizens. Other trade unions were forbidden and strongly repressed.

Implosive consonant

Implosive consonants are made up of stop consonants (and sometimes some affricates) with a mixed together glottalic ingressive and pulmonic egressive airstream (when the air stream is made by the lungs, ribs, and diaphragm) mechanism. That is, the airstream is used by moving the glottis down in addition to pushing air from the lungs. So, not like the purely glottalic ejective consonants, implosives can be changed by phonation. Contrastive implosives are seen in around 13% of the world's languages. 

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, implosives are indicated by changing the top of a letter (voiced stop) with a right-facing hook: ⟨ɓ ɗ ʄ ɠ ʛ⟩.

When the throat is closed, pulling the glottis down stretches, or decreases pressure in, the air in the vocal tract. The throat is then opened. In languages whose implosives are more common, that may result in air rushing into the mouth before it flows out again with the next vowel. To take in air sharply in that way is to "implode" a sound.

But, usually there is no movement of air at all, which contrasts with the pulmonary plosives. This is the case with many of the Kru languages, for example. That means that implosives are phonetically sonorants (not obstruents) as the concept of sonorant is usually defined. However, implosives can phonologically pattern as both; that is, they may be phonological sonorants or obstruents depending on the language.

George N. Clements (2002) actually proposes that implosives are phonologically neither obstruents nor sonorants.

The vast majority of implosive consonants are voiced, so the glottis is only partially closed. Because the airflow required for voicing lowers the vacuum being created in the mouth, implosives are easiest to make with a large oral cavity.

Royal High School, Edinburgh

The Royal High School (RHS) of Edinburgh is today a co-educational school. It is owned and run by the City of Edinburgh Council. The school was founded in 1128 and is one of the oldest schools in Scotland.

Until modern times it was only a school for boys. It is one of the oldest schools in the world. It dates from the 12th century AD. It was first the seminary of Holyrood Abbey, founded for Alwin and the Augustinian canons by David I in 1128.

In 1505 the school was described as a "high school", the first recorded use of this term in either Scotland or England.

The Romantic era at the turn of the 19th century caused an influx of foreign students, among them French princes. "Walter Scott stood head and shoulders above other writers". By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, an old scholar remembered, 'there were boys from Russia, Germany, Switzerland, the United States, Barbadoes, St. Vincent, Demerara, the East Indies, besides England and Ireland'. The Royal High School was used as a model for the first public high school in the United States, the English High School of Boston, in 1821.

The Royal High School moved to its current site at Barnton in 1968, leaving the Old Royal High School buildings. 

In 1973 it became a co-educational state comprehensive. This means it has no entrance qualifications, and accepts pupils of all intellectual standards, and both boys and girls. That is what the word "comprehensive" means in this context.

The school's premises underwent extensive refurbishment between 2001 and 2003, funded by a £10 million public-private partnership project with Amey plc.

Second French War of Religion

The Second French War of Religion was an armed conflict in France fought between the Catholic royal government and the Huguenots. The war began on September 25, 1567 and ended on March 23, 1568. 

The leader of the Huguenots, Prince Louis of Condé, feared that the young king, Charles IX, wanted to persecute the Huguenots. To prevent this, Condé and about 1,500 of his supporters attempted, on September 25, 1567, to kidnap the King at Meaux. This incident, known as the "Surprise of Meaux", led directly to the start of the Second War of Religion. The King escaped Condé's trap and fled into the city of Paris.

Condé began to rally his Huguenot army outside of Paris, and started to destroy the countryside. The Catholics, led by the Constable Anne de Montmorency, rallied an army as well and left the city to face the Huguenots in battle. On November 10, 1567, Montmorency and Condé fought a battle at Saint Denis, just outside Paris. There was no clear winner, but Condé had so few soldiers that he decided to retreat. Montmorency was wounded during the fighting, and died of his wounds two days after the battle.

Elsewhere in France, the Huguenot succeeded in capturing some, but not all, of the places they had taken in the First War. In much of the country, the Catholic population and government was more prepared than they had been in 1562 and prevented Huguenot take-overs. 

Huguenot forces from across France, from the start of the war, tried to march north and join Condé's main army. One of these groups, led by François de Boucé, seigneur de Poncenat, managed to defeat a Catholic army at the Battle of Cognat (January 6, 1568) and make its way up to the main army.

Synagogue Church building collapse

On 12 September 2014, a guesthouse in the Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) area collapsed to the ground. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and other emergency services were criticized for not giving enough information about the accident.

On 12 September 2014, a guesthouse collapsed in the SCOAN's area in Lagos, killing at least 115 people, 84 of them were South Africans.
The senior pastor of the church, T. B. Joshua has claimed to have predicted the Synagogue Church building collapse "three weeks before it happened".

While another Nigerian religious figure, Isaiah Ogedegbe seemed to have also predicted the incident eight months before it happened.

Nigerian emergency services refused to release the nationalities of the victims. However, other countries have given some details about those who died. Most of the casualties were from South Africa.
The then governor of Lagos State; Babatunde Fashola, ordered all church workers away from the scene in order to properly rescue trapped bodies. The government also claimed the church did not get government approval before construction.
Journalist Nicholas Ibekwe released an audio recording that allegedly captures T. B. Joshua offering bribes to journalists in return for reporting the incident in a way that favourably portrayed the church.
The senior pastor of the church, T. B. Joshua has linked the tragedy to a strange aircraft "hovering" above the building shortly before it fell.
A video was released on YouTube that allegedly showed the plane hovering around the building before its collapse.
However, the coroner's report discovered the cause to be due to structural failure.
Three government agencies - the Nigeria Building And Road Research Institute (NBRRI), the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) and the Building Collapse Prevention Guild (BCPG) examined the site and found the following errors:

Joshua failed to appear at a November 2015 hearing and SCOAN's lawyers have filed many applications to stop the trial.

The Lagos State government has repeatedly insisted that this case receive trial.

Local radio host Freeze made unfavorable comparisons to a similar incident in Lekki, in which Lekki Gardens managing director Richard Nyong was jailed for illegally unsealing a building that he was having constructed and that which later collapsed.
Freeze was unhappy because Nyong had been arrested quickly, Joshua had not.

Komsomolsk-on-Amur

Komsomolsk-on-Amur () is a city in Khabarovsk Krai, Russia. It is on the west bank of the Amur River in the Russian Far East. It is on the Baikal-Amur Mainline, northeast of Khabarovsk. Population: 

The city and its suburbs stretch for over along the left bank of the Amur River. The river at this point is up to wide. Lake Khummi is southeast of the city.

The distance to Khabarovsk—the administrative center (capital city) of the krai—is ; to the Pacific Ocean—about . The nearest other major town is Amursk, which is about south.

It is about east of Moscow. It is at the eastern end of the BAM Railway.

The future site of Komsomolsk-on-Amur was conquered by the Mongols in the 13th century. It became part of the Mongol Empire under the Mongol Yuan Dynasty.
It was later held by the Manchus until the area was ceded (given) to the Russian Empire in the treaty of Aigun in 1858. The village of Permskoye () was created on the later site of Komsomolsk in 1860 by migrant peasants from what is now the Perm Krai.
The government of the Russian SFSR announced plans in 1931 to build a shipyard on the Amur at the modern site of Komsomolsk. Construction began in 1932. The town was mainly built using volunteer labor from the Communist youth organization Komsomol. This is how the town received the name Komsomolsk. However, the construction of the town was helped by the use of penal labour from the prison camps in the area. The suffix "on Amur" was added to differentiate from other towns with the same name.

By the end of the 1940s, the shipyards plus facilities for other heavy industry had been completed. The city turned into a regional center for industries such as aircraft manufacturing, metallurgy, machinery, oil refining, and shipbuilding. Currently, Komsomolsk-on-Amur is the main center for the manufacture of Sukhoi military aircraft and the Sukhoi Superjet airliner. The MiG-15bis and the Lisunov Li-2 were both built in Komsomolsk-on-Amur.

Komsomolsk-on-Amur has a humid continental climate (Köppen "Dfb").

Leningrad Oblast

Leningrad Oblast (, , ) is a federal subject of Russia. Specifically, it is an oblast. 

It was created on 1 August 1927. It was not until 1946 that the oblast's borders had been mostly put in their current position. The oblast was named after the city of Leningrad. In 1991, the city restored its original name, Saint Petersburg. The oblast keeps the name of Leningrad. The capital and largest city is Gatchina.

The first governor of Leningrad Oblast was Vadim Gustov (in 1996–1998). The current governor, since 2012, is Aleksandr Drozdenko.

The oblast has an area of and a population of 1,716,868 (2010 Census); up from 1,669,205 recorded in the 2002 Census. Leningrad Oblast is highly industrialized.

The oblast is on the historic region of Ingria. It is bordered by Finland (Kymenlaakso and South Karelia) in the northwest and Estonia (Ida-Viru County) in the west. It also borders five federal subjects of Russia: the Republic of Karelia in the northeast, Vologda Oblast in the east, Novgorod Oblast in the south, Pskov Oblast in the southwest, and the federal city of Saint Petersburg in the west.

Leningrad Oblast is around the Gulf of Finland and south of two great freshwater lakes. These are Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. The oblast includes the Karelian Isthmus and some islands, including Gogland in the Gulf of Finland and Konevets in Lake Ladoga.
Much of the area is in the drainage basin of the Neva. The Neva is the only outflow of Lake Ladoga. Other major rivers in Leningrad Oblast include the Svir, the Vuoksi, the Syas, the Luga, the Narva, and the Volkhov.

The territory of present-day Leningrad Oblast was populated shortly after the end of the Weichselian glaciation. Several medieval trade routes crossed the area. 

In the 12th-15th centuries, the territory was divided between the Kingdom of Sweden and the Novgorod Republic. It was populated by many Baltic Finnic peoples such as Karelians in the northwest, Izhorians and Votians in the west, Vepsians in the east, and Ilmen Slavs in the south. The border moved back and forth across the land during the Russo-Swedish Wars of the 15th-17th centuries.

Most of the present-day territory of Leningrad Oblast was taken by Sweden with the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617. During the Great Northern War (1700-1721) the territory of what is now Leningrad Oblast was conquered by Russia under Peter the Great. He founded Saint Petersburg in 1703, which later became the capital of the Russian Empire.
In 1914, Saint Petersburg was renamed Petrograd. The governorate around the area was renamed the Petrograd Governorate. After the Russian Revolution, the capital was changed to Moscow. In 1919, during the Russian Civil War, the Northwestern White Army advancing from Estonia and led by Nikolai Yudenich tried to capture Petrograd and even managed to reach its southern outskirts. However, it ultimately failed and Yudenich retreated.

Leningrad Oblast was created on 1 August 1927. It was created by merging the Cherepovets, Leningrad, Murmansk, Novgorod, and Pskov Governorates. The total area of the oblast was ; more than four times larger than the modern Leningrad Oblast. Administratively, he oblast was divided into nine okrugs (Borovichi, Cherepovets, Leningrad, Lodeynoye Pole, Luga, Murmansk, Novgorod, Pskov, and Velikiye Luki), each of which was divided into districts.

In 1929, Velikiye Luki Okrug was given to the newly formed Western Oblast. Leningrad was separated from Leningrad Oblast in December 1931. In 1935 five southernmost districts were made part of Kalinin Oblast. In 1936 some parts of the territory of Leningrad Suburban District of Leningrad was returned to Leningrad Oblast and divided into Vsevolozhsky District, Krasnoselsky District, Pargolovsky District and Slutsky District (renamed Pavlovsky District in 1944).

Novgorod Oblast

Novgorod Oblast (, "Novgorodskaya oblast") is a federal subject of Russia. Specifically, it is an oblast. Its administrative center (capital city) is the city of Veliky Novgorod. Some of the oldest Russian cities, including Veliky Novgorod and Staraya Russa, are in the oblast. The historic monuments of Veliky Novgorod and surroundings have been made a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Population: 634,111 (2010 Census).

Novgorod Oblast borders Leningrad Oblast in the north and in the northwest, Vologda Oblast in the east, Tver Oblast in the southeast and in the south, and Pskov Oblast in the southwest.
In the center of the oblast is Lake Ilmen. Lake Ilmen is one of the largest lakes in Central Russia. The major tributaries of Lake Ilmen are the Msta, the Lovat, the Pola, the Polist, and the Shelon. The only outflow of the lake is the Volkhov, a major tributary of Lake Ladoga.
Two areas in Novgorod Oblast have been made protected natural areas of federal significance. These are Valdaysky National Park in the southeast of the oblast and Rdeysky Nature Reserve in the southwest of the oblast, which protects the Polist-Lovat Swamp System and is next to Polistovsky Nature Reserve in Pskov Oblast.

Novgorod is one of the oldest centers of Russian civilization. It was on the historical trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. This route followed the Volkhov upstream to Lake Ilmen and then followed the course of the Lovat before reaching the Dnieper. In 1136, Novgorod became the center of the Novgorod Republic. The Novgorod Republic included the major part of what is today northwestern Russia. Novgorod was part of the Hanseatic League. It was one of the few areas of Rus not affected by the Mongol invasions. It was also a major cultural center.

Towards the end of the 15th century, Novgorod was defeated by the army of Ivan III, the prince of Moscow. It was included into the Grand Duchy of Moscow. In 1560, Ivan the Terrible, fearing treason, sent his army to sack the city. This event was known as the Massacre of Novgorod. It had terrible consequences for the city, which lost the majority of its population and never recovered. Additionally, Novgorod was looted by the Swedish army in the beginning of the 17th century, during the Time of Troubles.
Before the 19th century, the areas around Novgorod were much better developed than the areas which are currently in the center and the east of the oblast. In 1851, Moscow – Saint Petersburg Railway opened. It was the first long-distance railway in Russia. It went around Novgorod as it was built on a straight line between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The railway construction lead to the development of the nearby areas and eventually to creation of new towns such as Malaya Vishera, Okulovka, and Chudovo.
On August 1, 1927 the governorates of the Russian Empire were removed. The territory of present-day Novgorod Oblast merged into newly created Leningrad Oblast. German troops occupied the area between autumn of 1941 and spring of 1944 during World War II. After its liberation on 5 July 1944, Novgorod Oblast was created.

In 1999, the city of Novgorod was renamed Veliky Novgorod.

The oblast is administratively divided into three cities and towns under the oblast's jurisdiction (Veliky Novgorod, Borovichi, and Staraya Russa) and twenty-one districts. Another seven towns (Chudovo, Kholm, Malaya Vishera, Okulovka, Pestovo, Soltsy, and Valday) have the status of the towns of district significance.

Population: 634,111 (2010 Census), down from 694,355 recorded by the 2002 Census, and further down from about 753,054 recorded in the 1989 Census.

Novgorod Oblast has the lowest population of any oblast in the European part of Russia. One of the reasons for the low population is that the area took large losses during World War II. The population is 70.6% urban.

In the 2010 Census, these were the largest ethnicities in Novgorod Oblast: 560,280 Russians (95.1%); 7,025 Ukrainians (1.2%); 3,598 Romani (0.6%); 3,438 Belarusians (0.6%); 15,054 others.

In his first appearance in 1975, Marc Spector was hired as a mercenary against the protagonist of the comic book "Werewolf by Night," Jack Russel. Editors Len Wein and Marv Wolfman then decided that instead of being an antagonist, Moon Knight would be a superhero. Moench and Perlin then wrote a story giving him a secret identity as a millionaire named Steven Grant. Moench then decided to write a story where Steven Grant uses the alias Jake Lockley. As Lockley, he pretends to be a taxi driver to find information about criminals. This was done so that Marc Spector would have more than one secret identity. Moench wrote two comic books where Marc Spector joked that he had schizophrenia. He wrote another where his girlfriend asks Marc if he has a split personality and he says he knows he is just acting when saying he is Steven Grant or Jake Lockley. After Moench left the comic, writer Steven Grant wrote the story so that Marc Spector had multiple personality disorder.

Secret identity

In works of fiction, especially comic books about superheroes, the hero will normally have an alias and costume aside from their real name while keeping the fact they’re superheroes a secret from everyone in civilian life. For example, Spider-Man doesn’t tell people he’s actually Peter Parker in a mask because then supervillains would try to kill the people Peter knows to get to him. And that’s also why Batman doesn’t tell people he’s Bruce Wayne and Superman doesn’t tell people he’s Clark Kent. Some supervillains will also have a secret identity because they don’t want people to know that they’re criminals. There are also some superheroes who don’t have a secret identity.

Johnny Lawrence

Johnny Lawrence is a fictional character who was played by Billy Zabka in the 1984 movie The Karate Kid and its sequel The Karate Kid Part II and is one of the two protagonists of the television series Cobra Kai.

Johnny Lawrence has a girlfriend named Alli Mills but she breaks up with him. Johnny sees her talking to a kid from New Jersey named Daniel LaRusso at a beach so he pushes Daniel to the ground and tells Alli to talk to him, takes her radio from her and says that he won’t give it back unless she talks to him. When she doesn’t, he smashes her radio and starts yelling at her. When Daniel tells him to stop, Johnny throws the radio at him so Daniel attacks Johnny with the karate he knows from the YMCA. But it turns out, Johnny has a black belt in karate given to him by a sensei named John Kreese at a dojo called Cobra Kai. So Johnny beats Daniel in a fight, beats Daniel up, punches him in the face and kicks him in the chest and groin. Then Johnny’s friends all join him in bullying Daniel. Because of that, Johnny gets the nickname The Karate King. Johnny and his friends later bully Daniel at Alli’s soccer try-outs and get Alli banned from soccer. Johnny goes to take a karate lesson at his dojo Cobra Kai where Sensei John Kreese teaches him that “the enemy deserves no mercy” and finds out that Daniel was thinking about taking lessons there, so Johnny and his friends crash their motorcycles into Daniel’s bicycle, while he’s riding it, attack him with their martial arts and push him off a hill. At a Halloween party, Johnny goes to the bathroom and Daniel sprays him with water for revenge so Johnny and his friends chase Daniel outside and beat him until he’s almost unconscious. Then Johnny’s friend Bobby thinks that Daniel is in serious danger and tells the others that they should stop but Johnny tells him that they will never stop because “the enemy deserves no mercy”. Then Mister Miyagi sees what’s happening so he attacks Johnny and his friends with his karate and rescues Daniel. When Johnny sees Mr. Miyagi and Daniel at his dojo he tells his Sensei John Kreese what happened and Kreese tells Miyagi to tell Daniel to fight Johnny so Miyagi says that they can fight at the karate tournament but until then Kreese has to tell Johnny and the others to stop bullying Daniel. Kreese agrees but says that if Daniel doesn’t fight then he’ll tell Johnny and the other that it’s “open season on this boy. Johnny later pretends to be nice when adults are around so that people won’t believe that he’s a bully. Johnny later tells Alli to break up with Daniel and be his girlfriend again. Alli says no but Johnny kisses her anyway so she slaps him. At the tournament, Johnny makes fun of Daniel for not knowing how to put on a karate uniform and in the last round Johnny’s Sensei John Kreese tells him to “sweep the leg” to beat Daniel and Johnny doesn’t want to do that but then does it anyway because Kreese told him to do it. Daniel then beats Johnny. Then Johnny hands the trophy to Daniel and tells him “Here. You deserve it. You know, LaRusso, you’re all right”.

In the prologue of the movie, The Karate Kid Part II, Sensei John Kreese of Cobra Kai yells at Johnny Lawrence and tells him he’s a loser for having only gotten second place, destroys Johnny’s second place trophy, puts him in a headlock, pushes him to a car and starts choking him but then Mister Miyagi sees and fights Kreese to save Johnny.

In the 2010 movie reboot of The Karate Kid, Dre’s bully Cheng is based on Johnny Lawrence but uses kung fu instead of karate. 

In Cobra Kai, an adult Johnny Lawrence is asked by a kid named Miguel Diaz to teach him his karate so that Miguel can defend himself from his bullies but Johnny says no. But after meeting the adult Daniel LaRusso, who got rich selling cars, Johnny realizes how much he hates Daniel and starts his own dojo that he calls Cobra Kai to teach Miguel. Johnny teaches his students “strike first, strike hard, no mercy” but after seeing his students Miguel and Hawk hurt Johnny’s son Robby in the tournament Johnny tries to change Cobra Kai karate to give it honour but then John Kreese comes back, takes over the dojo and forces Johnny out for weakness so Johnny takes Miguel out of Cobra Kai and starts his own dojo called Eagle Fang which ends up working with Daniel LaRusso against the Cobra Kai dojo. Johnny also falls in love with Miguel’s mother Carmen and gets her pregnant.

Daniel LaRusso was trained in karate at the YMCA in New Jersey and then moved to California with his single mother.

After Mister Miyagi rescues Daniel he tells him to go to Johnny’s sensei and ask him to tell his students to stop bullying him. But when they go to Johnny’s dojo, his sensei named John Kreese tells Daniel to fight his students and Mister Miyagi says Daniel will fight at the tournament. Mister Miyagi teaches Daniel karate using muscle memory but tells him to use karate only for self-defence and never for revenge. Sensei John Kreese tells his student Bobby to break Daniel’s leg to beat him but Mr. Miyagi heals Daniel and Daniel beats Johnny Lawrence with a karate move he learned based on a crane kicking.

Daniel goes with Mister Miyagi back to Okinawa and falls in love with a girl named Komiko. Daniel is harassed by someone named Chozen, whose uncle Sato wants to kill Mr. Miyagi, because Daniel found out that Chozen was cheating people out of their money. When Daniel and Miyagi save a little girl from a hurricane Sato helps them and Chozen is angry about that. Chozen gets revenge by kidnapping Komiko and says he won’t let her go unless Daniel agrees to fight him until one of them dies. Daniel says yes. Daniel fights Chozen and wins. Chozen thinks that Daniel will kill him but Daniel doesn’t because he believes in mercy and forgiveness.

In The Karate Kid Part III, Terry Silver sends people to rob Mister Miyagi’s store, steal his plants and destroy his property and attack Daniel and they say that they won’t stop unless Daniel fights in the karate tournament. Mister Miyagi tells Daniel not to fight in the tournament so Daniel goes to the police instead. Then the people who were harassing Daniel tell him that they will drown him and the girl with him unless he says yes and then Daniel agrees. So Daniel goes to Terry Silver and asks him to teach him karate. But then Daniel thinks that what Silver is teaching him is making him a bad person and asks him to stop so Silver tells him that John Kreese is alive and has Kreese attack him. After that Mr. Miyagi teaches Daniel fighting and Daniel wins the tournament.

In the television series Cobra Kai, Daniel believes that Cobra Kai karate is evil and tries to get rid of it and when he can’t he starts his own dojo called Miyagi-Do to teach kids how to defend themselves from bullies and teaches them what he learned from Mister Miyagi. Then John Kreese comes back and wants to destroy Miyagi-Do for revenge against Daniel so Daniel ends up working with Johnny Lawrence to stop Kreese.

Amílcar Barbuy

Amílcar Barbuy (29 March 1893 – 24 August 1965) was an Italian Brazilian football player and manager. A talented and well-rounded midfielder, he was known for his commanding presence, pinpoint tackling, ability to read the game, powerful kicks and great long passes and he was recognised one of the greatest players of Corinthians. Amílcar was a prolific forward who later became a midfielder, gifted with a powerful shot and a keen sense of goal.

Amílcar is of Italo-Brazilian descent. He has been involved with the club since the founding of Corinthians in 1910. He therefore played in the team that first played in the Campeonato Paulista in 1913 . Barely a year later, the club became champion for the first time. After the club was unable to participate in the competition in 1915 due to problems, they returned in 1916 and he became champion with the club again. Paulistano dominated the league for the next few years and the next titles did not come until 1922 and 1923.

In 1923 he transferred to Palestra Itália, today's Palmeiras. With this club he won the Campeonato Paulista in 1926 and 1927. In 1931 he moved to Italy to become a player-trainer for Lazio. He attracted many Brazilians to the club, including Matturio Fabbi, Armando Del Debbio and Wellington Rato, earning it the nickname Brasilazio. He was the first Brazilian to play for an Italian club.

In 1916, he was the first player ever to be called up to the national team for Corinthians. He entered the South American Championship with Brazil. A year later, he was back again and scored the 4-0 in the game against Chile. In 1918 he even briefly trained the national team. In 1919 Brazil was able to triumph for the first time and won the trophy, Amílcar scored against arch-rival Argentina. After two lesser editions, the country was able to triumph again in 1922. He scored first in the match against Paraguay. The country first drew three times and in the fourth game he and teammate Neco scored a goal against Argentina, putting Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay in first place. Uruguay withdrew from the final battle as they protested the umpires who would favor Brazil. Brazil played the final against Paraguay and was able to win it and again become champions.

At the end of his playing career, Amílcar converted to coaching. His first experience was on the Lazio bench during the 1931–1932 season.

After the Italian adventure, he returned to his native country to coach teams of the caliber of Corinthians, São Paulo, Palestra Itália, Portuguesa, Portuguesa Santista and Atlético Mineiro.






Jimmie Rodgers

James Charles Rodgers (born September 8, 1897 – May 26, 1933 in New York) was an American blues and Old-Time musician. He became country music's first major star along with the Carter Family. He was the founder of Blue Yodeling. He was nicknamed "Singing Brakeman", "America's Blue Yodeler" and Labeled "The Father of Country Music". His best-known songs include "T for Texas (Blue Yodel No. 1)" and "In the Jailhouse Now".

Born in 1897, Rodgers was the youngest of three sons, probably near Meridian, Mississippi. After the death of his mother, relatives in Mississippi and Alabama raised him. Eventually, Rodgers returned to his father Aaron Rodgers (and his second wife), a foreman at the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. Rodgers began singing and playing guitar as a child. He won a talent show when he was 12 and decided to pursue music for a living.

His father originally placed him on the railroad. He worked there for several years in various jobs, including as a brakeman on the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad, which earned him the nickname "Singing Brakeman". Besides his work, he took every opportunity to play music and improve his technique and style. He processed the experiences from these years again in his songs. In 1924, he contracted tuberculosis, had to give up his job on the railroad and struggled to make ends meet with music and the occasional job.

In 1927, Rodgers auditioned for music producer Ralph Peer, who was looking for rural talent to market. A single was produced and earned Rodgers $27. His next recording "T for Texas (Blue Yodel No. 1)" became a top hit. It sold over a million copies, an extraordinary success for the time. In 1928 more Blue Yodels were recorded. One of his most famous titles, In the Jailhouse Now, also dates from that year.

Rodgers quickly became a star. His records sold very well, the concerts were mostly sold out. Under the constant strain, his health continued to deteriorate. He spent the money lavishly, bought a luxurious villa and the most expensive cars. So he was forced to constantly produce more records and give concerts.

The world economic crisis that followed the stock market crash of 1929 aggravated his situation, because the population no longer had money for records and concert tickets. In early 1933, Rodgers ran into serious financial difficulties. Despite his serious illness, he was forced to take every opportunity to make money. After a breakdown, he decided to do one last recording session. A bed was set up in the studio and a nurse was present. Jimmie Rodgers recorded the last twelve tracks of his life.

He died two days later, on May 26, 1933, at the age of 35.

His career had only lasted six years. Still, the "Singing Brakeman" had a significant influence on all country musicians who came after him. Virtually every star of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s referred to him. The mostly self-written lyrics of his songs went far beyond the usual hillbilly themes. He was one of the first country performers to incorporate personal experiences into their songs. The best-known example is the TB Blues. Stylistically, too, he broke away from his predecessors. He used blues elements and developed American yodelling into Blue Yodel.

His compositions have been re-recorded many times over the decades and have always been hits. Webb Pierce & the Wilburn Brothers' version of In the Jailhouse Now spent 21 weeks at number one on the country charts in 1955. This was a record only Eddy Arnold and Hank Snow could equal, and it stood for 58 years until 2013. Also in 1955, Rodgers himself came out with a version of In the Jailhouse Now No. 2 on the country charts to number seven. Johnny Cash had a Top 10 hit within the Jailhouse Now in 1962. Sonny James placed 15th in 1977 with a live version.

In 1960, his Mule Skinner Blues by The Fendermen was in the top 5 of the US pop chart and even reached the UK chart. The first singer with a Rodgers hit was Dolly Parton, who propelled the Mule Skinner Blues to number three on the country chart in 1970. Other country music greats such as Tommy Duncan, Lefty Frizzell, Jim Reeves and Grandpa Jones also had top 10 hits with Rodgers' compositions.

In 1997, Bob Dylan issued a tribute album, interpreting the well-known musicians Rodgers songs. Dylan himself contributed My Blue Eyed Jane and accompanying text. The title of Dylan's album "Rough and Rowdy Ways" (2020) is also borrowed from Rodgers.

Rio Chingual Valley tree frog

The Rio Chingual Valley tree frog ("Hyloscirtus pantostictus") is a frog. It lives in Colombia and Ecuador on the east side of the Andes Mountains. Scientists have seen it between 1950 and 2700 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 55.54 - 68.14 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 64.1 mm long. The skin on this frog's back is olive green in color with orange spots.

This frog's scientific name comes from the Greek language word "pantostiktos", for "stained."

2022–23 Premier League

The 2022-23 Premier League was the 31st season of the Premier League. It was the 124th season of top-level football in England. Some new teams joined this season, including Fulham, Bournemouth, and Nottingham Forest. They replaced Burnley, Watford, and Norwich City. Manchester City became champions of the league for the third time in a row on May 20th after Arsenal lost to Nottingham Forest. This made Manchester City the second team after their local rivals Manchester United to win three titles in a row in the Premier League era. Manchester City has won a total of nine English titles and seven since 1992. On the other hand, Arsenal spent the most days at the top of the league without winning the title in the history of English top-level football. 

This season is special because all three teams that were promoted at the beginning of the season managed to avoid getting relegation. This hadn't happened since the 2017-18 season. Even the team that was in last place at Christmas, Wolverhampton Wanderers, managed to avoid getting relegated, which hadn't happened since the 2014-15 season. For the second year in a row, more than 15 million fans went to watch the matches, setting a new record with a total of 15,289,340 spectators attending the games. Erling Haaland scored the most goals by a player in a single season, with 36 goals.

The season started well for Arsenal with five games without losing. But they lost to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Manchester City did a good job from the beginning, signing Erling Haaland as a striker. They went nine games without losing until Liverpool beat them in October. Arsenal led the league for a while and were five points ahead of Manchester City by March. But a series of three draws let Manchester City catch up, and when they won 4-1 against another team, they took the lead. Manchester City won the league when Arsenal lost 1-0 to Nottingham Forest on May 20, 2023. They got the trophy on May 21, 2023.

Manchester United, led by Erik ten Hag in his first season as manager, got back to the Champions League and won the Carabao Cup. After 20 years, Newcastle United made it to the Champions League, which was a big deal. Liverpool had a tough season and ended 5th, missing out on the Champions League for the first time since 2015-16. But they had a huge 7-0 win over Manchester United on March 5, 2023.

Chelsea spent lots on new players under new owners, but they had a bad season. They finished lower in the table, changed managers twice, and ended up 12th – their worst in ages. Brighton & Hove Albion lost their manager to Chelsea, but the new one helped them finish 6th. Aston Villa got into European football for the first time since 2009-10. They changed managers and improved in the second half of the season to finish 7th. Tottenham Hotspur had a strange season. Their manager left, they had temporary managers, and finished 8th.

Bournemouth, expected to go down, surprised and stayed up. Nottingham Forest made loads of new signings and stayed safe with big wins. Another promoted team, Fulham, did well and finished 10th. Southampton got relegated first. On the last day of the season, Everton, Leeds United, and Leicester City were at risk of relegation. Leeds and Leicester went down, but Everton survived. Everton staying up meant their long run in the top division continues.

On September 9, 2022, all Premier League matches planned for September 10-12 were postponed as a sign of respect for Queen Elizabeth II, who had died. The next week, three Premier League matches set for September 17-18 were also postponed because of issues with policing connected to Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral on September 19. Additionally, in that same week, the Arsenal match against Manchester City, originally planned for October 19, was moved to a later date to make room for Arsenal's Europa League match with PSV Eindhoven, which was itself postponed from September 15 to October 20.

There was a break in the middle of the season because of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The last matches before the break happened on November 12-13, 2022, and the first matches after the World Cup were played on December 26, 2022, after the World Cup final on December 18, 2022.

Loitering weapon

Weapons that are capable of waiting over an area before they hit their target, are called loitering weapons. Other names include loitering munition, suicide drone or kamikaze drone (related pages: drone, and Kamikaze).

Those used during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, include ("RAM 2" or) RAM II, Switchblade (drone) and Bayraktar. Russia has been using Lancet, and Geran-2 (also known as "Shahed 136").

Loitering weapons are different from cruise missiles, because cruise missiles do not wait (loiter) over the target area. They are different from UCAVs in that a loitering weapon is intended to be used in an attack and has a built-in warhead.

Loitering weapons are more similar to a drone, but they also have some properties of a missile. In this type of weapon, the munition waits, until it detects a target, Sometimes, it waits until it is given a command to attack. Loitering weapons allow selecting targets more precisely.

The first loitering weapons were built in the 1980s. At that time, they were used against surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). They were used to suppress enemy air defenses in the 1990s. From the 2000s, loitering weapons have been developed for extra roles such as relatively long-range strikes, fire support or tactical, very short range battlefield systems that fit in a backpack.

Some of these weapons are capable of making decisions on whether to hit a target or not, on their own. If no human being is involved in this decision, this raises a number of ethical issues, and problems with international law. In many respects loitering weapons are not comparable to a missile, that is fired at a target. A loitering weapon may spend hours waiting for a target to appear. While it may request final clearance before the hit, this does not have to be the case. In other words: With a loitering weapon, there may be no human who decides what target is hit.

Urhobo people

The Urhobo people are an ethnic group in southern Nigeria in Delta State. They are the major ethnic group in Delta State. The Urhobo people speak the Urhobo language.


Professor Peter Palmer Ekeh, Founder of Urhobo Historical Society wrote in his book: Studies in Urhobo Culture, that "Urhobo is [...] in the Atlantic forest belt that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to Angola in central Africa. Historically, this region was the most pristine in all of Africa. Until the Portuguese burst into its territories in the late fifteenth century, its forest peoples cultivated their own forms of civilization, untouched by outside influences. This forest belt of western Africa was reached neither by ancient Christian influences, which had a large foothold in North Africa, nor by Islamic forces that came as far south as Hausaland by the eleventh century. While East Africa and even Central Africa were touched by Asian and Arab influences from across the Indian Ocean, as the amalgam of Swahili bears out, no similar trans-Atlantic influences breached the forest belt until the Portuguese arrival in the late fifteenth century".

Before marriage in Urhobo culture is said to properly contracted, prayers must be offered to the ancestors (Erivwin) and God (Oghene). The bride's father offers a prayer and blessing in the native dialect for the couple.

At this point, the bride sits on the husband's lap. The blessed drink is handed to the husband who drinks first; he then hands it to his wife to drink. The wife would drink and pass it back to her husband to finish, as a sign of respect. Then only are they declared husband and wife.

He played his debut match for the national team against Peru on April 10, 1952, alongside Ademir, Didi and Nílton Santos. The match, which ended 0-0, was for the 1952 Pan American Football Championship, which Brazil would win.

Two years later he was in the squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup. He scored the 2-1 tie against Hungary from the spot in the quarterfinals against Hungary. In the second half, the match would escalate very violently, and after the defeat, the Brazilians even attacked the Hungarians in the dressing room. The match went down in history as the Battle of Bern.

At the 1958 World Cup, he had to wait until the final before he could play his first game. He ensured that Swedish left winger Lennart Skoglund was neutralized and Brazil won 5-2. Four years later, star player Pelé injured himself in the group stage, forcing Brazil to rely on defensive rather than offensive football. In addition to Garrincha and Pelé's replacement Amarildo, Djalma Santos was one of the strongholds of the team, which could extend the world title.

He was also present at the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England. However, the adventure already ended in the group stage.

In 1968, he played his last international match in the 2-0 win against Uruguay. Until July 3, 1998, he was the player with the most appearances for the Seleção with 98 games.

After his active time he became a trainer of Panama. He later became the coach of the Brazilian football club EC Bahia, and in the mid-1980s he worked in Kuwait. He later taught at a football school in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.

From July 1, 2013, 84-year-old Santos had pneumonia, from which he died three weeks later.

José María Minella

José María Minella (1909–1981) was an Argentine football player and manager. He played for and managed Argentina's national team. 
He played as a midfielder; he was predominantly centre-half, although he initially held more offensive roles, such as in the 1930 world tour, in which he scored 11 times playing for Gimnasia La Plata. The first position he was employed in was that of left midfielder, at Independiente; later, due to his playing characteristics, which led him to manage the game, he was moved to the center, where he was assigned the number 5 of the centromediano. He was gifted with his marking technical ability. Considered as one of the best Argentine midfielders of all time.

Son of Italian immigrants, he was born in the La Perla district of Mar del Plata from a father originally from Villanova Monferrato.

He first met football in his native neighborhood, and later moved to Club Independiente in Mar del Plata. Moving to Gimnasia y Esgrima in La Plata, on June 4, 1931 he played there for the first time at a professional level, taking the field against Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires. He composed a solid midfield trio with Montañez and Míguez, and was part of the so-called Expreso, the Gimnasia line-up that came close to winning the 1933 championship, also becoming its captain. He was sold to River Plate for 37,500 pesos, a considerable figure for the time. With the new jersey he was immediately the owner, competing in the tournaments of 1936, 1937 and 1941, won by the club by the red band; in the last of these, however, he was scarcely employed, given his advanced age. In 1942 he left Argentina for Uruguay, and played two editions of the local championship, obtaining two consecutive second places. In 1944 he passed to the Chileans of the Green Cross, where he ended his career.

Minella made his debut in the Argentine national selection in 1933, after the successes with the shirt of Gimnasia; that team, however, was not properly considered official by the Federation. On January 6, 1935 he officially made his debut during the South American Championship in 1935, facing Chile in Lima. In 2-3-5 chosen by Manuel Seoane Minella was deployed as center-half and played the whole tournament in this position. On January 20 he took the field against Peru and on January 27 against Uruguay, both times as a starter, Argentina reached second place in the competition. In 1937 he participated in the second South American Championship, which was held entirely in Buenos Aires. Once again as a central midfielder, Minella was one of the cornerstones of that national team, since he played all the matches of the tournament. He made his debut on December 30, 1936 against Chile, and attended against Peru (January 16, 1937), Uruguay (January 23) and Brazil (January 30). At the end of the tournament, given the parity between Brazil and Argentina in the group, a play-off had to be played, in which Minella did not take part, replaced by Ernesto Lazzatti. In 1940 he participated in the Copa Juan R. Mignaburu and the Copa Héctor Rivadavia Gómez, while the following year he was part of the squad that played the Copa Presidente Roque Saenz Peña. In 1941 he was also called up for the South American, organized in Santiago, integrating the midfield together with Esperón and Sbarra in the first match against Peru on 12 February. On February 16 he was the starter against Ecuador, and on February 23 he played the first 40 minutes of the match with Uruguay. This was his last game in South American Championship premier international tournament. Minella turned down a chance to play for the South American Championship in 1942 where Argentina finished as runners-up.

Minella joined the River Plate bench the year after his retirement as a player; he replaced Renato Cesarini, creator of La Máquina, capable of winning several championships. In 1945, at his debut, Minella's first title as coach arrived, obtained one day from the end thanks to a 2-0 win over Chacarita Juniors. Minella deployed the team following the 2-3-5, the so-called "WM", module particularly popular in South America in those years. The 1946 season saw River hit third place, five points behind the winner, San Lorenzo de Almagro. In 1947 the team led by Minella was still champion, again one day from the end of the championship, defeating Rosario Central. In the 1950s the coach made an important contribution to the club's victories, which followed one another shortly after between 1952 and 1957. Key elements of that team were Ángel Labruna, Néstor Rossi and Amadeo Carrizo. The first trophy was obtained not without difficulty, while in 1953 the River got the better of Racing from Avellaneda; in 1955 the title also came thanks to a positive streak of 16 matches. In 1956 and 1957 the championships were dominated by River, but following the transfer of Omar Sívori to Juventus , the period of success came to an end, and Minella left the bench. In 1964 the coach was called by the Argentine Football Federation to hold the position of coach of the Albiceleste national team ; he made his debut on May 31 in Rio de Janeiro against Portugal. Minella was called up to direct the selection during the Taça das Nações, a tournament that included four national teams. In this event the Argentines obtained the victory, thanks to the three successes with Portugal, Brazil and England, all arrived without conceding goals. The CT made some particular choices, placing lesser known elements at the international level alongside already established players. After this title, he was confirmed on the bench, and took part in various tournaments, mainly of a friendly nature, including the Dittborn Cup and the Chevallier Boutell Cup. He was also the coach who led the national team to qualify for England 1966; however, he was replaced by Osvaldo Zubeldía first and then Juan Carlos Lorenzo, with the latter sitting on the Argentine bench during the Rimet Cup. In 1968 he was recalled as a replacement for Cesarini, and he was the coach for eight other matches, all friendly, collecting three defeats, three draws and two victories.

Mr. Miyagi was born in Okinawa and was taught karate by his father a fisherman and used it to stop people from killing him. Mr. Miyagi fell in love with a woman named Yukie who had an arranged marriage to Miyagi’s friend Sato so Sato asked for a fight to the death. Instead of fighting Sato, Mr. Miyagi left Japan and went to the United States of America and married a Japanese American woman. Mr. Miyagi fought against the Japanese Empire in the Second World War and while he was doing that his wife Mrs. Miyagi, gave birth to a son inside an internment camp and got sick and they didn’t send any doctor to her so she and the son both died. Mr. Miyagi still won a medal of honour for being a war hero.

In the movie The Karate Kid, Mr. Miyagi teaches Daniel LaRusso karate and teaches him that the reason to learn martial arts isn’t so that he will be good at fighting but so that he won’t have to fight.

In The Karate Kid Part II, Mr. Miyagi goes back to Okinawa after he finds out his father is dying and brings Daniel LaRusso with him. Mr. Miyagi’s father dies and Mr. Miyagi’s old friend Sato still wants to kill him but after Mr. Miyagi saves him from a hurricane, Sato gives up on revenge. Mr. Miyagi also warns Daniel LaRusso before Daniel fights Chozen to the death that “this not tournament, this real.” 

In The Karate Kid Part III, Daniel wants to fight in the karate tournament to get money but Mr. Miyagi tells him not to do that because he doesn’t believe in fighting for glory. So Daniel asks Terry Silver to train him and keeps that a secret from Mr. Miyagi. Then Daniel realizes that he’s broken Miyagi’s rules about only fighting for defence and never revenge and apologizes to Mr. Miyagi and Mr. Miyagi forgives him and saves him from John Kreese. 

In the movie, The Next Karate Kid, it turns out that in the Second World War, Mr. Miyagi’s friend Jack Pierce saved his life so Mr. Miyagi thanked him by teaching him karate. Jack Pierce taught that karate to his son and Pierce’s son taught karate to his daughter Julie Pierce. Then Julie’s father and mother died in a car accident so Julie’s grandfather Jack Pierce decided to teach her karate and then died of old age. Mr. Miyagi later teaches Julie karate so she can feel closer to her dead parents and grandfather. And at the end of the movie, Mr. Miyagi fights Colonel Dugan, the main villain and wins. 

In the 2010 reboot of The Karate Kid, Jackie Chan plays a character called Mr. Han who is based on Mr. Miyagi but teaches kung fu instead of karate.

Silver hires someone named Mike Barnes and some other people to harass Daniel LaRusso into agreeing to fight in the karate tournament. Silver also lies to Daniel and tells him that John Kreese is dead so that Daniel will let Silver teach him karate at Kreese’s dojo called Cobra Kai. Silver teaches Daniel to use violence to solve problems and to hate mercy. When Daniel tells Silver that he’s changed his mind and now won’t fight Silver tells him that John Kreese is alive and sends both Kreese and Mike Barnes to attack him but they’re stopped by Mister Miyagi. Silver gets Mike Barnes to try to win against Daniel by cheating in the tournament.

Terry Silver was John Kreese’s best friend when they were soldiers in Vietnam and Kreese saved Silver’s life so Silver paid for Kreese’s dojo called Cobra Kai. But after The Karate Kid Part III, their dojo was banned from the tournament so Silver decided to leave karate. Silver then fell in love with a woman who got him to become a vegan. Kreese then came back and asked Silver to join him and Silver said yes. Silver got their dojo to win the tournament by bribing the referee. And he also framed Kreese for attempted murder to get him sent to prison so that Silver could be the new sensei.

Terry Silver wants Cobra Kai to be part of a global martial arts competition but Daniel LaRusso thinks Cobra Kai is evil so he goes to Mike Barnes from The Karate Kid Part III and asks for his help. Silver finds out so he sets Barnes’s store on fire. When Daniel tries to wikt:surrender, Silver beats him up and tells him that the reason he doesn’t kill him isn’t mercy but because he wants him to suffer. Johnny Lawrence, Mike Barnes and Chozen from The Karate Kid Part II break into Silver’s house and attack him but Silver stops them by stabbing Chozen and letting his security fight the other two. Silver then goes back to his dojo, fights Daniel LaRusso and loses. Then the police arrest Silver for bribery.

Chilean recluse spider

The Chilean recluse spider, Loxosceles laeta, is a highly venomous spider of the family Sicariidae. It usually hides in cracks and corners that are difficult to access, hence its name. It is considered the most dangerous of the spiders of the genus Loxosceles, since its bite frequently produces severe systemic reactions and even death. The Sicarius spider is related to this spider and is therefore also considered dangerous.
Loxosceles laeta is native to South America. It is very common in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and southern Brazil.

It has been introduced to North America and several Central American countries, but does not naturally thrive in these countries. In the United States, the species became established in the Los Angeles area. Infestations have also been reported in Florida, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Vancouver, Canada.

The violinist spider is mainly nocturnal, its activity being increased on hot summer nights and with the moon. It is scary and quite fast. Although it is active throughout the year, its vitality decreases with the arrival of cold. That is why its favorite places during the day are the dark corners, from which it comes out to hunt. This species of spider hides in dusty and unclean places, for example, under gas tanks, behind pictures, cornices, bookcases or in closets, especially with clothes.

Another way is through its spider web, which has a messy and irregular design, and is generally located in right-angle profiles (corners), where it weaves a short, hammock-shaped horizontal web. White and cottony, it is not very effective for aerial hunting of insects.

Within the genus Loxosceles, this spider is the one with the largest distribution in South America and is the most dangerous. The anaphylactic picture produced by the toxin of the bite is called loxoscelism.

The venom of Loxosceles laeta is potentially fatal depending on the inoculum-mass ratio of the individual. Its action is essentially proteolytic and necrotic (dissolves tissues causing cell death). It contains powerful proteolytic enzymes that destroy everything that has protein, and can be 15 times more toxic than a cobra and 10 times more powerful than sulfuric acid burn. In addition, its venom has a high power of penetration in the liver and bile ducts. Its main toxic component is sphingomyelinase D, which interacts with cell membranes, triggering an immune reaction within the first 24-48 hours after the bite.

Esta É a Nossa Pátria Bem Amada

"Esta É a Nossa Pátria Bem Amada" (; "This Is Our Well Beloved Motherland") is the national anthem of Guinea-Bissau. Written in 1963 by Amílcar Cabral (1924–1973) and composed by Xiao He [zh] (1918–2010), it was adopted upon independence from Portugal in 1974.

Jan de Winter

Jan de Winter (5 August 1939 – 17 October 2022) was a Dutch sculptor, glazier and painter.

De Winter is known for his leaded windows and paintings and as an abstract sculptor. Many of his artworks are in the public area. One of his best-known works is leaded window 'Vuur, water en energie' (translated: Fire, water and energy). The ornament was designed in 1970 for the Gemeentelijk Energie- en Waterbedrijf (GEWB) (translated: Municipal Energy and Water Company). After the demolition of the building a school direcotor was able to save the artwork. It is since 2007 mounted above the main entrance of the Groen van Prinstererlyceum.

de Winter died in his house in Vlaardingen on 17 October 2022, at the age of 83 years old.

Gabilan Range

The Gabilan Range is a mountain range in the U.S. state of California. It is near the central coast of California in Monterey and San Benito counties. The Gabilan Range is part of the larger California Coast Ranges. The word "Gabilán" is Spanish for sparrowhawk. Pinnacles National Park is in the southern section of the range.

The Gabilan Range goes from northwest to southeast along the border of Monterey County and San Benito County. It is bordered on the east by the Diablo Range, the San Andreas Fault, and State Route 25; and on the west by the Salinas Valley, Santa Lucia Range, and U.S. Route 101. The northern limit of the Gabilan Range is just south of Pinecate Peak and San Juan Bautista, California.

Fremont Peak, which is high, is the range's highest point. There are several other peaks also over in the range.

In Spanish, "gavilán" (gabilan is an older spelling) means "sparrow hawk". Hawks, especially the red-tailed hawk, are common in the range.

The Gabilan Mountains and other nearby places are mentioned in several novels by John Steinbeck, such as "Of Mice and Men" and "East of Eden". In "The Red Pony", the main character (Jody Tiflin) names his pony "Gabilan" after the mountain range.

Fremont Peak was named for John C. Frémont, an American explorer and a Captain in the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. He traveled to the peak in 1846 to decide if it was useful for the U.S. military against Mexico. It is now a California State Park.

Wild animals can travel through a relatively undeveloped area between the southern Santa Cruz Mountains and the northern Gabilan Range. This area extends from Mount Pajaro in southern Santa Cruz County and Rancho Juristac in southern Santa Clara County, to lands between Pinecate Peak and San Juan Bautista in San Benito County. California State Route 129 and U.S. Highway 101 cross this area. In 2020, The Land Trust of Santa Cruz County bought the first block of land intended to protect the Santa Cruz Mountains-Gabilan Range Wildlife Corridor: the Rocks Ranch in Aromas at the border of San Benito and Monterey counties.

After a while cholera reached Sligo Town where Stoker lived. Cholera was very bad in Sligo. No other town in Ireland or Great Britain had it worse. Many caring for those who lost their health from cholera were also to catch and die from cholera. People were very worried and behaved very bad. For example they put people in graves before they were dead. Stoker, who was a 14 year-old child, seen and remembered all their bad things. Her family were in fear and went to Ballyshannon (some by road to the north) where they had other family. But the people of Ballyshannon were in fear that the Stoker family might have caught cholera and told them to go away. 
Stoker married in 1844. She met her husband-to-be Abraham in Coleraine, County Londonderry, while he was on holiday from his job at Dublin Castle. He was about 20 years older than her. His ancestors had come to Ireland with William of Orange and had made living by farming land they owned themselves. Once married they moved to Harcourt Street in Dublin before moving to The Crescent in Clontarf. They had seven children: Thornley, Matilda, Abraham (Bram), Tom, Richard, Margaret, and finally George was born in 1855. Bram was not a healthy child and had to stay in bed until he was seven years old. While Stoker taught all of the children at home Bram needed additional attention. Eventually all Stoker's sons were to be taught at Trinity College Dublin (TCD).

Stoker tried to do what she could to help Ireland overthrow its feudal past. She remembered the poor of Sligo, and the famines in Ireland where people did not have enough to eat and had to go to another country. In May 1863 she said at the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society in Ireland that there should be special schools for those who could not hear and speak.
Stoker's husband Abraham retired at in 1865 at age 65. He had borrowed money to send his sons to TCD. They moved to France with Matilda and Margaret in the 1870s because costs there were lower than Dublin. They left their sons in Ireland, all had done well. Thornley, Richard and George were in medicine, Bram at Dublin Castle, with Tom only still at TCD.

Abraham died in Italy on 12 October 1876 and was buried in Tirana. Stoker returned to Dublin after her husband died. Bram was by this time in London and asked her to write to him about her memories of the cholera in Sligo in 1832. Her reply letter is both a useful story of that event and and was used by Bram as a start for his stories and his famous book about "Dracula".

Stoker died in 1901 and is buried at Mount Jermone Cemetery, Harolds Cross, Dublin. She was 83 years old and her eyes were bad and she could not see.

Water polo at the 1922 Women's Olympiad

The water polo competition at the 1922 Women's Olympiad was held on 22 April 1922. It was the first ever women's water polo championship. The venue of the competition was the Port Hercules, the harbour of Monte Carlo, Monaco. The competition was won by the Netherlands, who beated the United Kingdom with 6-0.

Women's water polo was in the early 20th-century a rising sport. Until 1922 not many international matches have been held. However the Netherlands and Great Britain already played once against each other. In January 1914 the Ladies Water Polo Club played two matched in the Netherlands against the Dutch women's water polo team of the Hollandsche Dames-Zwemclub (H.D.Z.) in Amsterdam and The Hague. At the last Olympics, the 1920 Summer Olymipics, women's water polo was a demonstration event, where two women's teams from the Netherlands played against in each other in an exhibition match.

Initially the teams of the tournament were named to be The Netherlands and France. On 11 April 1922 it was stated a team from The Netherlands and a team from the United Kingdom would compete, with possibility of a French team. The French Swimming Federation withdrew the French water polo team because the French women's water polo players would not be good enough against the Dutch team.

In late January 1922 it was announced a Dutch team of seven players was invited to participate at the 1922 Women's Olympiad. On 13 February 1922 newspaper "Het Volk" published an initial Dutch selection: Alida Bolten (A.D.Z.), B. Noorwegen (A.D.Z.), Jo Evelein (H.D.Z.), Job van Laar (H.D.Z.), Loes Brandt (H.D.Z.), Annie Treffers (R.D.Z.) and Truus Klapwijk (R.D.Z.). Broer (R.D.D.) was named as the reserve. In the announcement two days later on 15 February of newspaper "De Telegraaf" and later in other newspapers, B. Noorwegen was not in the main selection but listed as a reserve. Goalkeeper H. van Leeuwen (H.Z. & P.C.) was listed in the selection. 'Former' reserve Broer was not mentioned anymore. On 15 March it was annouced that reserve player B. Noorwegen withdrew due to illness. Rie Beisenherz (A.D.Z.) became the new reserve player. 

Ahead of the Olympiad, special training sessions were organized with the team in Amsterdam. 

A week before the departure to Monte Carlo, midfielder Job van Laar had to withdrew due to family circumstances. Annie Treffers switched from attacker to midfielder and Beisenherz became attacker. It was stated that "her speed will be an improvement" for the team. B. Duykers became the new reserve player, but would't play. About the complete team was stated that it was a good team cohesion, but that it was not the best team that could have been sent to Monaco.
The British team consisted of water polo players from London.

The match of the Netherlands against the United Kingdom was won with 6-0 for the Netherlands. 

Multiple reports stated that the Dutch played very good together. The British ladies didn't have a good interplay. It was also stated that the Dutch ladies were predominantly better, especially in speed. The Dutch shots also attempted to score from a long distance, but these shots not successful and could easily be stopped by goalkeeper Doris Hart. The half-time score was 4-0. In the second half there were due to the cold water of the Mediterranean, less quick attacks. The British women were not able to score and only had during the match one shot at goal, that was stopped by goalkeeper Van Leeuwen.

Top scorer of the match was Rie Beisenherz with three goals. The other goal scorers were Alida Bolten, Loes Brandt and Jo Evelein. The best players of the British team were goalkeeper Hart and Verrall Newman.

The referee of the match was mr. Bergwall from Norway and received possitive feedback.

Shortly after the match the 5 metre platform diving event was held. Truus Klapwijk (who won the gold medal in the 3 metre diving event) was too tired after the match, and withdrew for the diving event.

Partly due to the water polo victory, the Dutch ladies were officialy honored on their return to the Netherlands at the American Hotel in Amsterdam.

The London Ladies Waterpolo Club went in January 1914 to the Netherlands. The club played two water polo matches against the Hollandsche Dames Zwemclub (H.D.Z.) and Haagsche Dames Zwem- en Poloclub also competed in swimming events. The water polo matches were one of the earliest international women's water polo meetings. The first match took place in Amsterdam on 27 January and the second match in The Hague on 28 January.

In early November 1913 it was announced the London Ladies Waterpolo Club would come in January 1914 to the Netherlands.

On 16 December 1913 it was announced the London Ladies Waterpolo Club would compete against H.D.Z. on 27 January 1914 in Amsterdam. The events were held at the . The event was advertised in national newspapers and tickets could be bought in advance. Next to water polo match of the London Ladies Waterpolo Club against the Nederlandsche Hollandsche Dames Zwemclub an international 4x 40 metre relay took place (also including ladies of the Haagsche Dames Zwem- en Poloclub) and national events were held.

The evening started at 8 p.m. with an ochestra playing the British national anthem.

Next to the international events, national events were held including a water polo match of the second team
of the HDZ against the first team of The Hague (1–1). Three HDZ women (Evelein, Lachman and Helweg) gave diving demonstration from the 1 metre and 3 metre springboard. Another three women (A. Kolk, Spangenthal and B. Duijkers) demonstrated doll diving.

Three teams competed in the 4x 40 metre relay. In the first part of the race, the Nederlandsche Hollandsche Dames Zwemclub were leading the race. But the women of the London Ladies Waterpolo Club won with a considerable gap ahead of Nederlandsche Hollandsche Dames Zwemclub and Haagsche Dames Zwem- en Poloclub. It’s described that miss G. Anndson, the last swimmer of the British team, had a fantastic swimming style.

Job van Laar became at the last moment a member of the team, after one team member withdrawn.


During the water polo match the Dutch women had a good teamwork, while the British women had very good shots and precision. In the first half the Dutch A. van Laar made the first goal, quickly followed by a second goal. At the end of the first half the British E. Ballard scored the first goal for the team. In the second half the British women were stronger. Especially captain D. Anderson played very well and scored. Just before the end of the match Ballard scored again and so the London Ladies Waterpolo Club won with 2-3.

The best Dutch defenders were named Job van Laar and Evelein, and best Dutch attacker being Annie van Laar.

In another match report the names of the goal scores are different, with names as Brandt scoring the second goal for the Netherlands and the British Annison scoring twice.

The events were organized as part of the first anniversary of the Haagsche Dames Zwem- en Poloclub. It was held on 27 January 1914 at the covered swimming venue in The Hague. An international water polo match and an international 20 metre freestyle was held. Next to the international events the evening started with a junior 20 metre freestyle, a water polo match of the Haagsche Dames Zwem- en Poloclub against H.D.Z. Amsterdam won the match with 4-0. Also other swimming events were held including: blind swimming, girls candle swimming, diving and doll diving.

Ahead of the water polo match, an “extra” event was held: the 20 metre freestyle. Four women from different cities competed against each other: London, The Hague, Rotterdam and Amsterdam. The British D. Anderson competed against the Dutch Van Laar, Schnwiert and Van Kappen. Anderson won in a time of 17.3, ahead of Van Laar.
It was planned the British team would play against a mixed team of players from the clubs from Amsterdam and The Hague. However, shortly before the international water polo match, it was announced that players of the Dutch Hollandsche Dames Zwemclub
were too tired to compete. This annoyed the Haagsche Dames Zwem- en Poloclub. While three women from Amsterdam still wanted to compete, the team from The Hague decided that the match would be played with only players from the club from The Hague. 

The match was described as an attractive match. The British team was much better compared to the Dutch team and had a very good accuracy and good shots and were faster. The British team won with 4–1. The Dutch goal was made with a good shot of an English substitute.

Bisexual flag

The bisexual flag is a pride flag representing bisexuality, bisexual people, and the bisexual community. The pink stripe represents homosexuality. The pink stripe represents heterosexuality. The purple stripe is the "overlap" of the two colors. This stripe represents attraction regardless of sex or gender. 

The flag was designed by Michael Page in 1998 to raise awareness of bisexuals in the world and in the LGBT community. He wanted to give the bisexual community a symbol like the rainbow flag was for the LGBT community. The first bisexual pride flag was shown at the BiCafe's first anniversary party on December 5, 1998. 

Page said that he took the colors and overlap from the biangles (also known as the bisexuality triangles). The biangles were designed by artist Liz Nania for the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights in 1987. The design of the biangles began with the pink triangle, a Nazi concentration camp badge that later became a symbol of gay liberation representing homosexuality. The addition of a blue triangle contrasts the pink and represents heterosexuality. The two triangles overlap and form lavender.

Page described the meaning of the pink, purple, and blue colors:

The flag is used in different aspect ratios. 2:3 and 3:5 are often used, which is common between flags.

The exact colors given by Page are PMS 226 for the pink, 258 for the purple, and 286 for the blue. The pink stripe takes up two fifths of the flag. The purple stripe takes up the middle fifth. The blue stripe takes up the other two fifths. The flag has been most commonly made with the pink stripe at the top, but both ways are acceptable. The flag is not patented, trademarked, or service marked.

Pansexual flag

The pansexual flag is a bright pink, yellow and cyan flag. It was made as a symbol for the pansexual community to increase its visibility and recognition.

The flag has been in wide use since the early 2010s when it was posted on an anonymous Tumblr account, by its creator Jasper V. The flag is used as a symbol of the pansexual community, just like the rainbow flag is used for the LGBT community. The pansexual pride flag is used to show that pansexuals have sexual attractions and relationships with people of different genders and sexualities.

The pansexual flag consists of three equally-sized colored horizontal bars. They are magenta on top, yellow in the middle, and cyan on the bottom.

Some sources say that the cyan represents attraction to men. But others say it represents people who are attracted to men. Magenta represents attraction to women. Yellow represents attraction to non-binary people such as those who are agender, bigender and genderfluid. Other sources say that the colours cyan, magenta, and yellow stand for those who identify as men, women and non-binary people, respectively.

These issues include income, job performance, pregnancy out of wedlock, and crime.

"The Bell Curve" also claims that average intelligence quotient (IQ) differences between racial and ethnic groups are partly genetic in origin. This view is now considered to be not true by mainstream science.

AIDS treatment

AIDS treatment is not a cure, but it stops the Aids virus from multiplying. The official name for the AIDS virus is the human immunodeficiency virus or viruses (HIV). The drugs keep sufferers alive, and also prevent them from passing in the infection to other people.

There is at present no actual cure for AIDS. What is changed is the development of anti-viral drugs. Patients have to take the drug capsules for the rest of their lives. It is thought that some 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone by the antiviral drug.

The Lancet says "Rather than dealing with acute and potentially life-threatening complications, clinicians are now confronted with managing a chronic disease that in the absence of a cure will persist for many decades". They are saying something like:
"AIDS will be with us a long time because this saves lives, but it's not a cure". However, it is a first step towards a cure.

October 2022 United Kingdom government crisis

In September and October 2022, the government of the United Kingdom, led by the Conservative party and the newly-appointed prime minister Liz Truss, went through an energy, economic and political crisis.

The crisis began after the 23 September 2022 United Kingdom mini-budget, which had many critics and negative responses by the world financial markets. This caused Truss to fire Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, on 14 October. 

In the next days Truss had many pressures to continue reversing many of her economic policies and by 17 October five Conservative Members of Parliament had called for her resignation. Many world leaders such as U.S. President Joe Biden criticized Truss's economic policies.

Overall, her economic policies caused the pound to fall to a record low against the US dollar and there was an increase in the cost of government borrowing.

On 19 October Suella Braverman, the home secretary, resigned over a technical breach of the Ministerial Code. Braverman's resignation letter was very critical of Truss. Later that day, MPs voted on a Labour Party motion to create time to debate a ban on fracking in the United Kingdom. The vote caused confusion among Conservative MPs who were not clear if it was a confidence vote.

On 17 and 20 October, Truss had meetings with Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee. The meeting on 17 October caused Truss to miss an emergency Prime Minister's Questions, in which Penny Mordaunt, answered on Truss's behalf. Truss not going to the debate was criticized by many politicians.

On 20 October Truss announced that she would resign, but remain in office until the Conservative Party had chosen her replacement. She is the shortest serving Prime Minister in history. The leadership election was held shortly after with Rishi Sunak elected to replace her on 24 October 2022.

On 11 October, "The Economist" published an article criticising Truss and said that she had seven days in control of the economy. They wrote: "That is roughly the shelf-life of a lettuce." Since then, many commentators were comparing Truss's time as prime minister to lettuce. On 14 October, the "Daily Star" began a live stream on YouTube of a lettuce dressed as Truss to see if it would rot before the Prime Minister resigned, which it did not.

After Congressman Frank Underwood gets his friend Garett Walker elected President of the United States, Walker breaks his promise to make Frank Underwood Secretary of State, so Frank gets angry and tells his wife Claire Underwood that he will get revenge. So Frank blackmails a Congressman from Pennsylvania named Peter Russo into working for him and Frank makes an alliance with a reporter named Zoe and has an affair with her that way he can use both Peter and Russo to make sure that everyone knows all of the secrets of the people that Frank wants gone. Frank then convinces Peter to run for Governor of Pennsylvania, kills Peter and makes Peter’s death look like a suicide so that Frank can convince the Vice President to run for Governor of Pennsylvania so that if he wins then President Walker can make Frank Underwood the new Vice President of the United States. Zoe, Zoe’s friend Janine and Zoe’s boyfriend Lucas start to suspect Frank of murder. 

Frank Underwood kills Zoe after she asks him if he killed Peter Russo and makes it look like an accident. When Lucas tries to prove that this happened, Frank and his assistant Stamper frame Lucas for Internet terrorism. Frank frames President Walker for money laundering to get him impeached and Frank takes over as President of the United States. 

President Frank Underwood appoints his wife Claire Underwood United States Ambassador to the United Nations but fires her after she publicly criticizes the homophobic laws in Russia. Frank says that he will run for President of the United States in 2016 and will destroy unemployment with a law called AmWorks. Claire tells Frank she wants to divorce him.

Frank is trying to convince the Democratic Party of the United States to let him run for President but then his wife Claire Underwood sends the Internet a black and white photograph of Frank’s father Calvin taking a loan from the Ku Klux Klan and a picture of Frank going to an American Civil War re-enactment with someone dressed as a Confederate soldier. Claire tells Frank she’ll stop if he makes her Vice President, Frank says no. Then Lucas shoots Frank and is killed by the Secret Service but Frank survives and apologizes to Claire. Frank tries to use the NSA to rig the election but when an actual terrorist group shows up he can’t do that anymore so instead he decides to tell the American people to be scared because “I can sell fear”. 

After the election ends in a tie between Frank and a Republican Governor named Will Conway, Frank and Claire decide to have Kentucky be the tie-breaking vote so Frank shows a recording of Conway having a nervous breakdown and another recording of Conway’s running mate saying he wanted to kill Frank. Ex-President Garett Walker says he knew about the money laundering when he was President and that it was actually Frank’s idea. Congress starts trying to impeach Frank while a journalist named Tom Hammerschidt suspects that Frank killed Zoe so Frank frames his assistant Douglas Stamper. Frank also confesses to the money laundering and quits being president so that his Vice President Claire Underwood can give him a pardon but then she doesn’t. 

Frank Underwood doesn’t appear in the sixth season because Kevin Spacey was fired. The show says that Frank died but doesn’t say how until the last episode. Frank had wanted to kill Claire Underwood for not pardoning him so Frank’s assistant Stamper killed Frank because he didn’t want murder to be what people remembered about Frank.

House of Cards (novel)

House of Cards is a novella by Baron Michael Dobbs. Dobbs was in the British House of Lords in the 1980s. 

After an argument with Margaret Thatcher, Dobbs decided to write a book whose protagonist was an evil politician with the initials F.U. So he made a fictional character named Francis Uruqhart. 

In the book, Uruqhart finds out that a man named Roger O’Neal is addicted to cocaine and blackmails O’Neal into helping him while Uruqhart has an affair with a female journalist named Mattie Storin so she will write the stories that he wants her to write. 

Then Roger O’Neal’s girlfriend breaks up with him so he has a nervous breakdown. He is angry with Uruqhart so Uruqhart gets O’Neal drunk until he falls asleep and puts rat poison in O’Neal’s cocaine to kill him and make the murder look like a suicide. Uruqhart feels guilty about that so when Mattie asks him if he killed Roger O’Neal he kills himself by jumping off a balcony.

The BBC made a television miniseries created by Andrew Davies based on the book and called it House of Cards. In it, Francis Uruqhart was played by Ian Richardson. The show changed the ending to Uruqhart killing Mattie Storin so that he could become Prime Minister of Great Britain.

In March 2017, Dan Reynolds told "People" that the song was inspired by his experiences with ankylosing spondylitis in 2015. He said that, "The meaning of the song is really reflecting on specific things in my life that were painful, whether it was anxiety and dealing with crowds, feeling overwhelmed by that or the success of the band, disease, going through depression—anything that was a source of pain in my life. And just rising above that, finding a place of perspective where I could be appreciative of the pain in my life and make it my greatest strength."

It ends with Reynolds barely conscious, while Young Dan is revealed to have sketched a symbol identical to the one on Reynolds' chest, the "Evolve" symbol. As of 2022, the video has over 2 billion views and over 20 million likes. It is currently the most-viewed and most-liked video on the band's YouTube channel.

It became their fifth number one song on the US Hot Rock Songs chart.

Lead singer Dan Reynolds said that "Natural" is about "finding yourself and being willing and able to stand up to whatever adversity comes your way". He said in a press release announcing the song: "Living in a dog-eat-dog world can bring out the worst in you, and sometimes, the best. It would be a lie to tell you I haven't become somewhat skeptical about some things in the last decade of my life. However, I believe that when you truly learn to love yourself, the judging eyes and hateful words become meaningless."

The song was chosen by ESPN as the anthem of the 2018 "College Football" season. It is the second time that an Imagine Dragons song was chosen, the first being "Roots" in 2015. "'Natural' has the energy, spirit and drama of each team's journey to the College Football Playoff, and that is why it was chosen as this year's anthem," said Emeka Ofodile, ESPN vice president of sports marketing. It is also part of the soundtrack for EA Sports' NHL 19.

"Natural" is a pop rock song which features a "mix of explosive drums and inspiring lyrics", with "stadium-rocking instrumentation" over the chorus.

A music video for the song was released on August 24, 2018. It shows frontman Dan Reynolds as the owner of a spooky house including shots of a woman in a bathtub, the same woman being chased by other inhabitants of the house and a very tall man that looks like Slenderman, a supposed funeral for the woman, Wayne Sermon, Ben McKee and Daniel Platzman fading into dust, Reynolds digging a grave and burying the woman alive, and other shots of the house and its inhabitants, along with a clip of a lion mauling a zebra.
Its music video has gotten over 410 million views and 4 million likes as of March 2021.

On July 19, 2018, Imagine Dragons made a live television debut of the single on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". The performance featured a guitar solo by lead guitarist Wayne Sermon that expanded on the studio recording.

Anne Graham Lotz

Anne McCue Graham Lotz is an American Protestant evangelist. She is the 2nd daughter of the evangelist, Billy Graham, and his wife Ruth Graham. She founded AnGeL ministries. She is the author of more than 10 books. Her most known book is ""Just Give Me Jesus"".

Anne McCue Graham Lotz was born in 1948 in Montreat, North Carolina. Anne is the 2nd child of the five children born to Billy Graham and Ruth Graham. The Graham Family had settled near Ruth's parents in Montreat. It remains today as the Graham Family Home, Little Piney Cove.

Ruth was often the single parent for months at a time to the 5 Graham children. Of her caring and teaching to the children, Anne says, "My father, was away almost full time. I was raised pretty much by single parents and grandparents, and then I didn't know any different."

Anne became a Christian at the age of about 8 years old after watching The King of Kings, a Cecil B. DeMille film, on Good Friday.

Anne Graham graduated from high school. Shortly after that, she married Dr. Daniel Lotz on September 9, 1966, at the age of 18. The young couple lived in Raleigh, North Carolina. This is where Dr. Lotz was beginning his dental practice. She had her first child at the age of 20, two more children in the three years that followed. She did not work outside her home. Anne says this was a hard time in her life saying: “Early in my marriage, I felt like I drifted from God just because I was busy – you know, small children, small house, all the business of being a housewife. But I sought God through the Scripture. That’s when I got into the Bible myself.”

In 1975, Lotz heard about Bible Study Fellowship, a Bible class for women that used a highly structured study method. She wanted a class to be offered in her hometown of Raleigh. She waited for a year for someone else to teach the class. Although no one else did, so she decided to teach the class herself. The class quickly filled up with 500 people and had a waiting list. Lotz continued to teach the weekly class for 12 years. During this time, she began to receive many speaking invitations. In 1988, Anne left Bible Study Fellowship traveling from place to place to find a teaching ministry.

Upon leaving her Bible Study Fellowship teaching class afterwards Anne founded AnGeL Ministries, a non-profit organization based in Raleigh, NC to fasten her ability to accept teaching invitations. Lotz says the name "AnGeL Ministries" takes her initials "AGL" and adds the "n" and "e" to form the word "AnGeL", "because angels in the Bible were messengers of God, and they went where God sent them and they give the message you put on their heart, and I felt that describes what I do."

In the early years of AnGeL Ministries, Anne accepted invitations to speak all over the world: at priest's conferences, at women's conferences, and world evangelism conferences. By the year 2000, she felt her ministry taking a different direction.

Although as a female evangelist she had some resistance from conservative Protestants, her popularity is such large that she gets crowded by fans in the whole world. The New York Times in 1999 considered her one of the five most influential evangelists in the United States.

Post-rock

Post-rock is a type of experimental rock music. It focuses more on making different tones and musical textures than other rock music does. Many post-rock musicians are instrumental. The genre came from indie music communities in the 1980s and 1990s. A lot of post-rock music is inspired by ambient, jazz, and electronic music.

The bands Talk Talk and Slint made some of the first post-rock songs. The word "post-rock" came from a review of an album by Bark Psychosis in 1994. The word has been used to describe many bands with different styles. Many musicians do not like this, because it makes it harder to define what post-rock is.

Post-rock is inspired by many genres of music, such as krautrock, jazz, math rock, and avant-garde music. Many post-rock songs are long, and slowly build up the dynamics and timbre of the music. Many post-rock songs do not have any vocals in them, but some do. 

Vocals in post-rock are often used to create sounds instead of sing lyrics. Sigur Rós, a post-rock band known for their vocals, made up their own language for their music. They use the language to make sounds that are "gibberish" but fit "the music".

Puente Colgante de Santa Fe

The Ingeniero Marcial Candioti Bridge, better known as the Santa Fe Suspension Bridge (), is a suspension bridge in the city of Santa Fe, Santa Fe Province, Argentina. It goes across the Setúbal lagoon. It connects the west coast of the lagoon to the east coast of the lagoon. It is also a symbol of the 
city of Santa Fe and a symbol of its people. It has a long history that includes an almost total collapse in 1983 and its restoration after twenty years.

It was originally made to take water from the Colastiné neighborhood and to connect the city with the Universidad Nacional del Litoral and the El Pozo neighborhood, among other places. The bridge is now a tourist attraction. As a landmark and monument in Santa Fe, it is a meeting point for celebrations, social gatherings and festivities. It has inspired poets, artists, photographers and documentaries.

After standing for 55 years, one of its pillars collapsed on September 28, 1983 because of a strong flood that had lasted several months. It was a surprise to everyone, and many photos and videos from the neighbors and journalists of that time show a slow fall. The east antenna collapsed at 4:35 p.m., keeping only half of the structure standing. The Santa Fe newspaper "El Litoral" published that day, “A goodbye that wants to be see you later". Part of the bridge sank into the Setúbal lagoon and was recovered in 1984. The bridge was not rebuilt until 20 years later.

The administration of the then governor José María Vernet was associated with the image of the fallen bridge. First, due to the interventions of man in the flood valley, caused by the occupation of the river land by buildings, and the mismanagement of dredging.

Second, due to the scandal that produced the verification of irregularities in the sale of parts of the suspension bridge. The recovered material was taken to the city port, where it was left in the custody of the provincial government. Months later, that material was sold for scrap.

The reconstruction of the bridge was wanted by most of the people of Santa Fe, since it had always been a source of pride for the city. 

The works began in April 2000 by the company "CCI Construcciones" and an attempt was made to largely respect the original structure of the 1920s. This is clear, for example, in the inclusion of a pipe that does not fulfill any function, but that it did in its first construction.

The bridge, once rebuilt, preserved the original elements, integrating them with the new ones and contrasting them, without breaking the visual unity of the work. This new bridge preserves the original west antenna, assembled in 1924. The new antenna was built in the city of Esperanza, by the Ferma company. 

It arrived in Santa Fe at the end of April 2001 and was assembled with a gigantic crane on July 6 of that year. It differs from the old antenna in that it lacks rivets, and its joints are made by welding. It reopened in September 2002.

On May 25, 2017, the work of the new lighting of the bridge was inaugurated, the sodium lamps were replaced by LED lighting integrated with Philips Color Kinetics technology, which allow 1,600,000 light possibilities, which required an investment of $23 million of Argentinian pesos. It has 320 artifacts in linear form and 104 devices and projectors to illuminate the towers, it also contains programmable controllers that allow lighting scenes to be generated.

Dzerzhinsk, Russia

Dzerzhinsk () is a city in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia. It is on the Oka River. It is about east of Moscow and west of Nizhny Novgorod. Population: 

It was previously known as Rastyapino (until 1929).

It was first mentioned in 1606 as Rastyapino (). It is now named after Felix Dzerzhinsky. Dzerzhinsky was a Bolshevik leader who was the first leader of the Soviet Cheka (secret police).

Dzerzhinsk is a large center of the Russian chemical production industry. In the past, the city was also one of Russia's main areas for the making of chemical weapons. Because of its strategic importance, the city was, until recently, officially closed to foreign visitors.

The making of chemical weapons started in 1941. It was mainly focused on the making of lewisite and yperite (mustard gas). The factory producing these substances was named the "Kaprolactam" (or "Caprolaktam") Organic Glass Factory. It also made prussic acid and phosgene.

The making of chemical weapons at Dzerzhinsk stopped in 1965. Some materials were moved to storage areas. Lots of waste material was buried in dumps at the site of the factory. The yperite facility was destroyed in 1994. As of 1998, the lewisite production area was still not completely destroyed.

, Dzerzhinsk had 38 large industrial enterprises, which export their goods worldwide. About one thousand types of chemical products are made in Dzerzhinsk.

National University of the Litoral

The National University of Litoral (, UNL) is a public university in Argentina. It is based in Santa Fe, the capital of Santa Fe Province.

The university is the result of great works by governors and legislators of the province and the mobilization of students and all the citizens of Santa Fe. It was born as a regional university, since it included schools and institutes located in the cities of Santa Fe, Paraná, Rosario and Corrientes. Their creation had novel features because it included Faculties and schools located in different cities of the region.

The first Faculties were Law and Industrial and Agricultural Chemistry.
It was established as the "Universidad Provincial de Santa Fe" (Provincial University of Santa Fe) in 1889. The Argentine university reform of 1918 brought modernization and democratization to higher education in Argentina. The university was made the following year by a national law signed on October 17. They becane the first regional university in the country, with influence over the Argentine Littoral (Santa Fe and the Mesopotamic provinces of Entre Ríos and Corrientes).

The city was first the family manor of Counts Bobrinsky in the 18th century. They industrialized the city near the end of the 19th century. The city was first known as Bobriki () and was officially established in 1930. It became a coal (lignite) mining center during the Soviet period. In 1933, it was renamed Stalinogorsk (). During World War II, the city was occupied by the German Army from November 22, 1941 to December 11, 1941. In 1961, it was given its current name. The city was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor on January 14, 1971.

Boundary value problem

In mathematics, a boundary value problem is a problem to solve a set of differential equations. In addition, there are a set of constraints which are called the boundary constraints. A solution must both solve the differential equations, and the boundary constraints. 

Boundary value problems are common in many fields of science. 

Boundary value problems can be found in several branches of physics as any physical differential equation will have them. Problems involving the wave equation, for example the determination of normal modes, are often stated as boundary value problems. A large class of important boundary value problems are the Sturm–Liouville problems. The analysis of these problems involves the eigenfunctions of a differential operator.

To be useful in applications, a boundary value problem should be well posed. This means that given the input to the problem there exists a unique solution, which depends continuously on the input. Much theoretical work in the field of partial differential equations is devoted to proving that boundary value problems arising from scientific and engineering applications are in fact well-posed.

Among the earliest boundary value problems to be studied is the Dirichlet problem, of finding the harmonic functions (solutions to Laplace's equation); the solution was given by the Dirichlet's principle.

Difference of two squares

In mathematics, the difference of two squares is a squared (multiplied by itself) number subtracted from another squared number. Every difference of squares may be factored according to the identity
in elementary algebra.

Starting from the left-hand side, use the distributive law to get
By the commutative law, the middle two terms cancel:
leaving

The result is one of the most commonly used identities in mathematics. Among other many uses, it gives simple proof of the AM–GM inequality in two variables.

The proof holds in any commutative ring.

However, if this identity holds in a ring "R" for all pairs of elements "a" and "b". This means "R" is commutative. To see this, use the distributive law on the right-hand side of the equation and get
For this equation to be equal to formula_6, we must have
for all pairs "a", and "b". So that "R" is commutative.

Vanilla ice cream

Vanilla is a common flavor in ice cream, especially in North America and other countries. Vanilla ice cream was originally made by cooling a mixture of cream, sugar, and vanilla above a container of ice and salt. The type of vanilla used to give the flavour to the ice cream depends by places. In North America and parts of Europe, people are interested in a more smoky flavor, while in Ireland, a anise flavor is used. To create the smooth texture of ice cream, the mixture is stirred many times and then goes back to the container of ice and salt to continue the process. Many people often consider vanilla to be the normal flavor of ice cream.

X-Seed 4000

X-Seed 4000 is a visionary megatall skyscraper.

Its proposed 4 km height, 6 km wide sea-base, and 800 floors capacity that could fit 500,000 to 1,000,000 people. This structure would have been made using 3 billion kilograms of steel.
It was designed for Tokyo, Japan. The design was made by the Taisei Corporation in 1995. It was designed as a future-like environment combining ultra-modern and technological living and interaction with wildlife and nature. Methods of transportation within the X-seed would most likely include MagLev trains.

"The X-Seed 4000 'is never meant to be built'." says Georges Binder, managing director of Buildings & Data, a firm which compiles data banks on buildings worldwide. "The purpose of the plan was to earn some identification for the firm, and it worked."
Unlike other skyscrapers, the X-Seed 4000 would be forced to protect its occupants from large internal/external air pressure effects and weather rising that its great elevation would cause. Its design calls for the use of solar power to keep internal environmental conditions. 
As the proposed site for the structure is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the most active volcano range in the world, the X-Seed 4000 would be weak to earthquakes and tsunamis.

A sea-based location and a Mount Fuji shape is some of this building's other major design features. The real Mount Fuji is land-based and is 3,776 metres in height. This is 224 metres shorter than the X-Seed 4000.

X-Seed 4000 is planned to be twice the height of the Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid at 2,004 metres. 

The Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid for Tokyo was proposed in 2007. This plan also faces most of the same problems as X-Seed 4000.

Orbit of the Moon

The Moon takes 27.3 days (3.9 weeks) to orbit around the Earth. One side of the Moon faces the Earth at all times, so the moon is tidally locked to Earth.

The phases of the Moon come from the position of the Moon relative to the Earth and Sun. If the Moon and Sun are on opposite sides of the Earth, there is a full moon. If they are on the same side of Earth, there is a new moon.

The Moon makes one circle around Earth, called the "sidereal month", in 27.3 days. But in this time, the Earth continues to move forward, so the Moon will be in a different place relative to the Sun, and the phase of the Moon will be different. To reach the same phase, the Moon must travel a bit farther. The time for the Moon to reach the same phase, called the "synodic month", is 29.5 days.

Bolsa Família

Bolsa Família (, "Family Allowance") was a social welfare program of the Government of Brazil. Bolsa Família gave financial aid to poor Brazilian families. To be able to benefit from this program, families had to make sure that their children went to school and got vaccinated. 

The program tried to lower both the short-term poverty by direct cash transfers and fight long-term poverty by increasing human capital through conditional cash transfers. 

It also worked to give free education to children who couldn't afford to go to school, to show the importance of education.

In 2008, "The Economist" said that Bolsa Família was an "anti-poverty scheme in Latin America [which] is winning [supporters] worldwide." The program was an important policy of former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's social programs, which many saw the reason for his re-election in 2006. Bolsa Família was the largest conditional cash transfer program in the world.

A study by the UNDP Poverty Centre found that over 80% of the Bolsa Familia benefits went to families in poverty (making under half the minimum wage per capita), making most of the benefits going to the poor.

2006 Brazilian general election

General elections were held in Brazil on 1 October 2006 to elect the president, National Congress and state governors, with a second round of the presidential election on 29 October as no candidate received more than 50% of the vote in the first round.

Then-President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was running for re-election against São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin.

Though Lula was expected to win in the first round with a large majority, the President only won 48.7% to Alckmin's 41.6%, causing a second round of voting. Despite becoming popular because of his Bolsa Família program, Lula da Silva's popularity shrank because of the scandal "Dossiergate" which involved his party's leadership. This allowed Alckmin to increase his popularity in the polls in the weeks before the runoff. However, Lula won in a landslide in the second round with 60.83%, with Alckmin winning 39.17%, a lower vote percentage than he did in the first round. 

2010 Brazilian general election

General elections were held in Brazil on 3 October 2010 to elect the president, National Congress and state governors. As no presidential candidate received more than 50% in the first round of voting, a second round was held on 31 October to choose Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's replacement as President of Brazil. Lula da Silva had already served two terms after winning the elections in 2002 and being re-elected in 2006.

With the support of Lula, the Workers' Party (PT) nominated Dilma Rousseff, a former member and co-founder of the Democratic Labour Party. For her vice presidential running mate, Dilma chose Michel Temer, a member of the centre-right Brazilian Democratic Movement, who was President of the Chamber of Deputies.

The centre-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) nominated José Serra, who resigned as Governor of São Paulo to run for president. He had been the presidential nominee of his party in 2002. For his vice presidential running mate, Serra chose Indio da Costa, a conservative Federal Deputy.

Marina Silva, a Senator from the northwestern state of Acre and former Minister of the Environment under Lula, left the PT to run for president as a member of the Green Party. Silva, became popular with younger voters and won almost 20% of the vote in the first round.
The main three candidates were:
In the first round, Dilma won 47% of the vote, Serra 33% and Silva 19%. Dilma went on to beat Serra in the second round, becoming the first female President of Brazil. Dilma won 56.05% of the vote against Serra's 43.95% of the vote.

2014 Brazilian general election

General elections were held in Brazil on 5 October 2014 to elect the president, the National Congress, and state governorships.

The program had many forms, from direct financial aid to the poorest families (with the "Bolsa Família" card) to creating water cisterns in Brazil's semi-arid areas to support family farming and giving access to microcredit.

An economic evaluation of Bolsa Escola did find significant effects on both school attendance rates and the number of children involved in child labor.

The investigation then found members of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, Democrats, Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and seven other political parties were also involved. The scandal, however, did not hurt Lula da Silva's popularity as much as he was re-elected in 2006 in a landslide victory.
