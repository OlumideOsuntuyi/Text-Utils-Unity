No true Scotsman

A no true Scotsman fallacy, or appeal to purity, is a fallacy which occurs when a universal (“all”, “every”, "any" etc.) claim is refuted or is given counter-evidence to and the claim is altered by going from universal to specific, and failing to give any objective criteria for the specificity rather than conceding the point or meaningfully revising the claim; it is a form of moving the goalposts. The name comes from an example made up by Anthony Flew.

"No true Scotsman puts brown sugar on his porridge. The fact that Angus MacGregor puts brown sugar on his porridge just proves that he's no "true" Scotsman!"

Logical Form:


Example:


The word "Scotsman" can really be replaced with any group a person is talking about.

Examples are: 


For the argument to not be a fallacy, the thing being talked about must have a trait that excludes themselves from the category.

One argument that is not a no true Scotsman fallacy is "Janice is not really a vegetarian because I saw her eating a chicken sandwich yesterday." Vegetarians, by definition, are people who do not eat meat. Since Janice ate a chicken sandwich, a meal that has meat in it, Janice is therefore not a vegetarian.

Another argument that is not a fallacy is "Jim is not an atheist because he believes that there could be a god or gods". Since the definition of an atheist is someone who fully believes that there is no god or gods, Jim therefore cannot be an atheist because he does not fully believe that god or gods do not exist. However, Jim could be an agnostic, someone who is does not know for sure whether or not god or gods exist.

Another argument that is a fallacy is "Darcy is not really a Democrat because she is against abortion.". Even though most Democrats are for some levels of abortion, not all people who vote for Democrats are for abortion. Darcy might agree with the Democratic Party on other issues, like having a higher minimum wage or spending less money on the military, but disagreeing on one issue does not automatically make her not a Democrat. In fact, most people who vote for certain political parties will not agree with their party on every issue, but they will agree on the issues that are most important to themselves. 

On the other side, saying "to be Christian is to be Republican" is also a fallacy. Although in America, a higher number of Christians vote for Republicans, there are also many Christians who vote for Democrats. There are also many non-Christians such as atheists, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, etc., who vote for Republicans.

Hal Sims in 1935, the latter between the married couples Culbertson and Sims. 

Four team matches were played in London. These matches had big publicity in newspapers, on radio and on cinema newsreels. The hands became the subject of intense discussion on bidding methods.

Culbertson was finally beaten in Budapest, June 1937, in the final match of the first world championship teams tournament, by the 6-man Austria team led by Dr. Paul Stern. It was his last appearance in a tournament or match.

Culbertson founded and edited "The Bridge World" magazine, which is still published today, and wrote many newspaper articles and books on bridge. He owned the first firm of playing card manufacturers to develop plastic cards, Kem Cards, and developed and owned a chain of bridge schools with teachers qualified in the Culbertson bidding system. He continued to play high-stakes rubber bridge for many years, but gave up tournament and match competition in 1938 to write and work for world peace.

Anglo-American matches after World War II, of which there were a number, did not involve Culbertson.

Bleating tree frog

The bleating tree frog ("Litoria dentata") is a frog from Australia. It lives in New South Wales and Queensland.

This frog lives in lagoons and swamps not far from the ocean and sometimes in forests. It has a very loud call similar to that of a cicada. 

This frog grows to about 4.5 cm in length from nose to rear end. It has a flatter body than most frogs. During the day, it hides under stones or pieces of treebark but sometimes in human-made objects. Human beings sometimes pick it up without knowing and move it from place to place while it is hiding in pipes or flowerpots.

This frog lays eggs in temporary bodies of water. The eggs float on top of the water. The tadpoles grow into frogs quickly so they do not die when their homes dry up. 

Alfred Binet

Alfred Binet (; 8 July 1857 – 18 October 1911) was a French psychologist who invented the first practical IQ test. This is called the Binet–Simon test.

In 1984, the journal "Science" 84 picked the Binet-Simon scale as one of twenty of the century's most significant developments or discoveries.

Externality

In economics, some decisions affect third parties. These parties can be affected by the decision positively or negatively, but this influence is involuntary. This is known as an externality, or an external effect. The problem with externalities is that no one pays for the cost of these effects. Usually, they are not part of the decision process. Externalities are often a form of market failure. In many cases, actors like states need to become active. 

An example of an externality is pollution. One way to solve this is to introduce taxes on the goods that cause the pollution, for example carbon dioxide, which is the one of the causes of global warming. With concepts such as emissions trading, these externalities can again become part of the market system (and are no longer external).

Divergent series

In mathematics, a divergent series is an infinite series that is not convergent, meaning that the infinite sequence of the partial sums of the series does not have a finite limit.

If a series converges, the individual terms of the series must approach zero. Thus any series in which the individual terms do not approach zero diverges. However, convergence is a stronger condition: not all series whose terms approach zero converge. A counterexample is the harmonic series

formula_1

The divergence of the harmonic series was proven by the medieval mathematician Nicole Oresme.

Benfica Juniors and remained there for 2 seasons. He eventually moved on to the Portuguese team Ribeirão in 2011 and Rio Ave in 2012. After delivering several good performances with Rio Ave, he attracted the interest of the Portuguese superpower Benfica who then signed him in 2015 with a release clause (the fee that any team would be required to pay before the player's contract expires) of €45 million. His time at Benfica proved to be successful as he won 4 titles in 2 seasons with them.

Meanwhile Pep Guardiola, upon his selection as a manager at Manchester City, made many transfers including the buy of Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. Due to dissatisfaction with the performances of Bravo and promising career of Ederson at Benfica, Guardiola decided to replace Bravo after just one season by buying Ederson for a €40 million fee. The transfer made Ederson the second-most expensive goalkeeper of all time (currently 4th), behind only Gianluigi Buffon.

Principle of stationary action

Pierre Maupertuis stated in 1746 that many processes in nature are either optimal, or they take extreme values. This is known as the principle of stationary action and is a part of mechanics. It states that physical fields and particles will sometimes take extreme values (which are maximal or minimal). For this reason, it is often called principle of least action. Maupertuis gives a way to determine equations of motion when looking at the action of a mechanical system.

One of the first to formulate this was Pierre de Fermat. In the 1600s, he wrote: "light travels between two given points along the path of shortest time".

Maupertuis wrote: "The laws of movement and of rest deduced from this principle being precisely the same as those observed in nature, we can admire the application of it to all phenomena. The movement of animals, the vegetative growth of plants ... are only its consequences; and the spectacle of the universe becomes so much the grander, so much more beautiful, the worthier of its Author, when one knows that a small number of laws, most wisely established, suffice for all movements."

Byers island

Benjamin Morrell writes that he landed on an island he called Byers Island, on 12th July 1825. According to Morrell, this island was at a position of 28 degrees 32 minutes North, and 177 degrees 4 seconds East. He writes about this, in his book "A narrative of four voyages".

This island is a phantom island, and does not exist. Just before, he visited Pearl and Hermes Reef, and gives exact positions for the reef. It can therefore be excluded, that he landed on Kure, and gave a wrong position for it.

Byers is the name of the owner of the ship, and one of Morrell's employers.This is another hint that Morrell may be the source of the hoax. According to Burton R. Pollin, Morrells ghostwriter was the magazine editor and playwright Samuel Woodworth.

So even though Morrell may not be the source of this and other false items in his work, he certainly knew about them. He knew about the "rectified" content of his book.

Morrell sacrificed his scientific reputation in order to be able to increase the sales of his book.

The official maritime manual of 1899 already lists Byer island and Morrell Island as doubtful.

Despite this, globes of 1960s still show the islands, along four other phantom islands, northwest of Kure.

Great Britain road numbering scheme

In Great Britain, roads are given a letter with 1-4 numbers after it. This is how they are named. The letter is the category of the road. There are two main types of categories: motorways (with the letter "M") and non-motorways. There are two types of non-motorways: A roads (with the letter "A") and B roads (with the letter "B"). A roads are more important than B roads. There are also a very small number of C roads.

This system only applies to the island of Great Britain. Northern Ireland and other islands have their own systems.

In England and Wales, the six A roads with one number are most important roads coming out of London. Starting with the A1 which goes north, numbers go clockwise around London:

In Scotland, important roads from Edinburgh have A roads with one number:

Galois theory

Galois theory (pronounced "gal-wah") is a subject in mathematics that is centered around the connection between two mathematical structures, fields and groups. Fields are sets of numbers (sometimes abstractly called elements) that have a way of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Groups are like fields, but with only one operation often called addition (subtraction is considered addition with negative numbers). Fields are often hard to study because there are so many possible combinations of numbers, that the internal structure is hard to decipher. Groups are usually much less complex and easier to understand. Galois theory gives a concrete connection between hard to study fields and easy to study groups.

The nature of Galois' work is extremely advanced. It is usually considered out of reach for general audiences, or anyone without a strong technical background in Abstract algebra. This article will go into some detail, mostly defining types of equations and groups, and give a brief overview of the main ideas behind Galois theory. This article may not truly belong on "Simple English Wikipedia", though it may be referenced by those who have trouble understanding the main "Wikipedia" page, and just need a brief discussion on the subject. Beyond the first paragraph of this page, some mathematical experience may be required. All things considered, any high schooler should be able to follow the main ideas laid forth in this article.

In the year 300 BCE, the Greek mathematician Euclid (pronounded yook-lid) wrote a book on geometry titled "Elements." The text contained thirteen books, all on how to solve problems in geometry. Euclid was able to find ways to bisect any angle; that is, he was able to find an angle that was half of any other angle. Euclid was able to do much more, too. He could construct with a straightedge and compass shapes like circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and others. However, he was unable to find a way to make every possible polygon. For example, Euclid was unable to make a regular 9-gon, a shape with 9 equal sides, using only ruler and compass. Mathematicians, like Euclid, tried to solve other problems as well. If they could cut any angle in two halves, then was there a way to cut "any" angle into three equal angles? Similarly, was there a way to square the circle (find a square with area equal to π, or a square with side length equal to formula_1 ), or double the cube(find a cube with twice the volume of another, by constructing a side of the cube with length formula_2 )? These questions remained unanswered for over 2000 years.

A polynomial equation is an equation where you are only allowed to add and subtract multiples of powers of a variable, like formula_3. An "n"th power is a variable multiplied by itself "n" times. Or example polynomial has 5th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st powers of "x". The degree of a polynomial is the largest power found in the equation. In school, students learn about a type of polynomial equation called a quadratic equation. This is an equation where the highest power, or multiple, is two. An example of a quadratic equation isformula_4, or formula_5. Notice that the only thing we care about is that there is a squared term. This makes the equation quadratic. If formula_6 are numbers and formula_7, then formula_8 is a valid quadratic equation. You may remember from school that if you know formula_6 then you can solve this equation using the quadratic formula,formula_10which gives the solutions to our equation only by plugging in formula_6. Mathematicians hoped to find a simple equation for the solutions (or, roots) for "any" polynomial equation, hopefully using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and two other simple calculations: powers and roots. Mathematicians were able, after years of work, to find equations for polynomials with degree 3, and eventually degree 4. However, no one was ever able to find a formula for the solutions to a polynomial with degree 5 or higher. Why not? What was preventing them from being able to plug in the (in this case, since there are 5 powers) formula_12 in formula_13 and get the answers? No one could find out why.

The solution to these problems arrived out of the study of fields and groups. It turns out that each equation has a special field and group associated with it.

The field associated with each equation has complicated structure. However, you can tell a lot about the structure by how much you can rearrange elements by shuffling without changing the structure.

All of the ways of shuffling a field can be turned into a group. There are special types of groups, called the "Symmetric Group on n elements" labeled S, which are all the ways of shuffling "n" things. Symmetric groups are well behaved and easy to work with when you only shuffle 1, 2, 3, or 4 things. If you use 5 or more, the structure of the symmetric group becomes too chaotic.

Up until the early 1800s, mathematicians were able to find some answers for specific cases of these unsolved problems. Unfortunately, no one had given a reason (or, proof) for any equation. It was French mathematician Évariste Galois (25 October 1811 – 31 May 1832) who was the first to find a solution, explaining why certain equations like 2nd, 3rd, and 4th degree polynomials did have nice solution formulas, but other equations, like 5th degree and above, cannot have a formula. The answer boiled down to reducing the problem of the equations's field to the equation's group; Galois proved that the two had a connection.

Galois noticed that the structure of the groups associated with polynomials were really just the symmetric groups in disguise. If the degree of a polynomial was "n", then the group of the polynomial was the symmetric group on "n" elements. Galois saw that the group of the equation shuffled the roots of the polynomial, and the structure of the shuffles could be analyzed instead.

Euclid had wanted to find a way of cutting any angle in thirds. Galois showed that if a ruler and compass could be used to make a third of an angle, it would have an associated equation of degree 3. He showed that only powers of two could be made, by analyzing the equation's group and field. Galois showed that trisecting an arbitrary angle was impossible. Galois' theory could also be used to show that it was impossible to square a circle and double a cube.

Galois used his theory to also show that for polynomials of degree 5 and higher, their associated groups were S. He also showed that if an equation had a formula to solve it, then the group of the equation would have a nice structure and was not chaotic. Since the structure of the symmetric group "is" chaotic for formula_14, he showed that no general formula could exist for those polynomials.

Bumpy rocket frog

The bumpy rocket frog or Peter's frog ("Litoria inermis") is a frog from Australia. It lives all across the northern and eastern parts of Australia, in Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia.

An adult frog is 3.5 cm long from nose to rear end. It is light and dark brown with some yellow marks on its legs and a white spot near its jaws. Its front feet have no webbing and its back feet have some webbing. Its skin is bumpy.

The scientists who first wrote about this frog in the 1800s thought it was a burrowing frog, meaning a frog that likes to dig into the ground and spend time underground, but it is not. Its scientific name, "inermis", means "does not have a weapon". Most burrowing frogs have sharp bones in their feet, but the bumpy rocket frog does not. Burrowing frogs use these bones to dig.

This frog lives in flood plains, forests, grasslands, swamps and streams, but it can live in rocky places if there are streams through them.

Females lay their eggs 100-300 at a time in temporary bodies of water with no plants in them. The tadpoles can grow to 4 cm.

Appeal to novelty

Appeal to novelty is a fallacy where a person would claim that Subject B is better than Subject A because Subject B is newer, or that "newer is better". This fallacy is understandable because people find new discoveries everyday. Since new discoveries are made everyday, people are quick to think that the new thing will be better than the old thing because of the possibility that the new thing was made to fix the mistakes of the old thing.

An example of appeal to novelty is that "the newer versions of the iPhone will always be better then the older versions because smartphone technology becomes more advanced every year."

An example that people use to prove this argument wrong is New Coke, because even though it was made later than the older Coca-Cola, most people who have tasted New Coke say it tasted worse than Coca-Cola.

The opposite of appeal to novelty is appeal to tradition.

Traditional Chinese medicine

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a branch of traditional medicine from China. It is at least 3,500 years old. Treatments include herbal medicine, acupuncture, cupping, massage, and exercise. Since the methods of TCM are different from Western medicine, it is hard to find evidence that shows how safe or good TCM really is. 

Many of the most important ideas in TCM are based on the teachings of Daoism. Based on the teachings of TCM, it is important to balance the five elements in a person's body: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Each element also has something called "yin" and "yang", or opposite values that must exist alongside each other rather than to overcome the other. The way to balance the "yin" and "yang" is to strengthen "qi", or an invisible force that brings balance to the "yin" and "yang". Knowing the five elements and the "yin" and "yang" is important because each organ of the body is related to one of the five elements. It is important to strengthen a person's "qi" because balancing the "yin" and "yang" of a person's organs is important for people to be healthy. The different treatments in TCM are made to bring balance to the elements in a person's body.

These ideas are similar to, but not the same as, the four temperaments, which was an widely-believed theory in European medicine before scientific medicine was created. In the 19th century, many European doctors working as missionaries in China started translating TCM. For example, Dr. helped spread it to Germany.

Traditional medicine is a branch of medicine where treatment is based on knowledge passed on within certain cultures before the era of modern medicine.

Krishna Janmashtami

Krishna Janmashtami, also known simply as Janmashtami or Gokulashtami, is an annual Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu. It is observed according to the Hindu calendar. It is on the eighth day of the Krishna Pakshain Shraavana or Bhadrapad (depending on whether the calendar chooses the new moon or full moon day as the last day of the month), which overlaps with August/September. 

Janmashtami holds deep spiritual and philosophical significance. It teaches devotees important life lessons such as the pursuit of righteousness, the significance of selfless service, and the ultimate victory of good over evil. 

Lord Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita emphasize the importance of performing one's duty without attachment to the results, which resonates with people from all walks of life.
It is an important festival particularly to the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism. Dances of the life of Krishna according to the "Bhagavata Purana" (such as Rasa Lila or Krishna Lila), devotional singing at midnight when Krishna was born, fasting ("upavasa"), a night vigil (ratri "jagaran"), and a festival (mahotsava) on the following day are a part of the Janmashtami celebrations. It is celebrated throughout India.

Krishna Janmashtami is followed by the festival Nandotsav, which celebrates the occasion when Nanda Maharaj, father of Krishna, distributed gifts to the villagers of Vrindavan in honor of the birth.

Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic

The Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (, "Çumhuriji Şūraviji Sotsialistiji Toçikiston"; , "Tadžikskaja Sovetskaja Socialističeskaja Respublika"), also commonly known as Soviet Tajikistan and Tajik SSR, was one of the republics of the Soviet Union which lasted from 1929 to 1991.

Nowadays known as Tajikistan, which became a sovereign state after the fall of the Soviet Union, it is located in the southern mountaineous region of Central Asia.

The Tajik Republic was created on 5 December 1929 as a national place for the Tajik people within the Soviet Union. It succeeded the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik ASSR), which had been created on 14 October 1924 as a part of the mainly Turkic Uzbek SSR in the process of national delimitation in Soviet Central Asia. On 24 August 1990, the Tajik SSR declared sovereignty in its borders and was renamed the "Republic of Tajikistan" on 31 August 1991, then finally declaring independence from the Soviet Union just a bit more than a week after.

Just like modern-day Tajikistan, it was bordered by Afghanistan to the south, Uzbekistan to the west, Kirghizia to the north, and China to the east. Pakistan was to its south, separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor.

Surudi Milli

"Surudi Milli" (, , meaning "National Anthem") is the name of the national anthem of Tajikistan. It became the country's national anthem in 1994.

Tajikistan is a Persian-speaking country in southern Central Asia that used to be part of the former Soviet Union. Like all Republics of the Soviet Union, each regional republic had their own anthem. Some of those former Soviet republics kept their anthem's tune in their modern-day post-Soviet national anthems, as independent countries. Tajikistan is one of them. The tune of Tajikistan's national anthem is based on that of the Anthem of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, which was composed by a Bukharan Jewish composer named Sulaymon Yudakov, and the words to that song was written by an Iranian-Soviet poet named Abulqosim Lohuti.

After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tajikistan became a newly independent country. Unlike other then newly independent former Soviet republics, which all either replaced their old anthem with a new one or at least changed the words to reflect their independence, Tajikistan did not. Even when the USSR was no more, Tajikistan was still using the Soviet-era anthem. It wasn't until three years later, in 1994, the sovereign government wanted to change the words, in order to reflect the country's independence. A Tajik poet named Gulnazar Keldi wrote the new words to their national anthem. It was then when the words of the Soviet-era anthem was dropped, and were replaced with his new words. However, the Tajikistani national anthem still uses the same tune composed by Yudakov, that was used for the Soviet-era anthem. It remains the national anthem to this day.

Bloons

Bloons is a video game series. It is made by Ninja Kiwi.

The first "Bloons" game was made by Stephen and Chris Harris, who are two brothers from New Zealand. Before working on "Bloons", the brothers had released "Cash Sprint", which was a racing game. After "Cash Sprint" proved to be successful, the brothers made their own website for flash games. However, the site wasn’t successful. The brothers decided to focus on making their own games, and made a website called Ninja Kiwi, which had five games when it opened. The site was a success, and this led to the brothers’ work on "Bloons".

The basic concept for "Bloons" came from Stephen's wife. When Stephen asked her what would be fun in a new game, she talked about carnival games with darts and balloons. The first version of "Bloons" was developed quickly, and the game was released in April 2007. It proved popular, and soon reached nearly 100,000 players per day. By 2011, "Bloons" had been played over 3 billion times.

Affinity chromatography

Affinity chromatography is one way scientists separate molecules from each other. Using affinity chromatography, they can take just one kind of molecule out of a mixture of many molecules. Affinity chromatography works on molecules that exist inside the bodies of living things and not on other molecules. Affinity chromatography is one kind of liquid chromatography.

Affinity chromatography works because most molecules from inside living things stick to some molecules but not others, the way magnets stick to opposite magnets but not to wood or plastic. An antibody will stick to its antigen but not to a different antibody's antigen. A protein will stick to its own receptor or inhibitor but not to a different protein's receptor or inhibitor. A DNA-splicing protein will stick to its own DNA sequence but not to a different DNA sequence. In affinity chromatography, the thing that the target molecule sticks to is called the "ligand".

To prepare for affinity chromatography, scientists decide which molecule they want and find its ligand. The ligand could be an antibody if the target molecule has an antigen; DNA if the target molecule is a polymerase, DNA-binding protein, or DNA-binding enzyme; aromatic molecules if the target is a different kind of enzyme; or a peptide if the target is another biomolecule. Then they prepare a "stationary phase" and treat it with the ligand. The stationary phase can be membranes, special beads, or supports with different-sized pores in them.

Then the scientists pour the mixture, or "mobile phase" over the stationary phase. Sometimes, the scientists add a "binding buffer" to help the target molecule stick to its ligand. Then the scientists rinse away the rest of the mixture. The target molecule is stuck to its ligand, which is stuck to the stationary phase, so it is not rinsed away. Then the scientists add an "elution buffer" to make the ligand let go of the target molecule so they can collect it. Scientists sometimes use machines or special tools to hold the stationary phase in exactly the right position and to pour the mixture, rinse, and other treatments in exactly the right way.

In some affinity chromatography, the binding buffer and elution buffer work by changing the pH of the solution. That means they make it more acidic or less acidic. Because most molecules from living things change shape depending on how much acid is nearby, the binding buffer and elution buffer can make the ligand and target molecule change shape to hold on tighter or let go of each other.

Affinity chromatography does not always work perfectly. Sometimes the scientists must purify the target molecule to make sure they did not accidentally collect other molecules too.

Because scientists need to prepare a stationary phase with exactly the right ligand, they can only use affinity chromatography to collect molecules that they already understand well. Usually, they cannot use affinity chromatography to collect new or strange molecules.

Examples include Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primaries, businessman Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

1976 Democratic Party presidential primaries

The 1976 Democratic presidential primaries were how voters of the Democratic Party chose its nominee for President of the United States in the 1976 U.S. presidential election. 

Former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter was selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 1976 Democratic National Convention held from July 12 to July 15, 1976, in New York City. 

1976 Democratic National Convention

The 1976 Democratic National Convention met at Madison Square Garden in New York City, from July 12 to July 15, 1976. The convention nominated former Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia for president and Senator Walter Mondale of Minnesota for vice president. 

John Glenn and Barbara Jordan gave the keynote addresses. Jordan's keynote address made her the first African-American woman to deliver the keynote address at a Democratic National Convention.

The convention was the first in New York City since the 103-ballot 1924 convention.

Draft evasion

Draft evasion is any attempt to escape a government-forced legal requirement to serve in the military forces of one's nation. Sometimes draft evasion involves refusing to work with the military draft laws (formally known as conscription laws) of one's nation.

Illegal draft evasion is said to have characterized every military conflict of the 20th and 21st centuries. Such evasion is generally considered to be a criminal offense. On the other hand, there is evasion out of religious or ethical beleif called conscientious objector.

Camp David Accords

The Camp David Accords were a pair of political agreements signed by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on 17 September 1978, following twelve days of secret negotiations at Camp David, the country retreat of the President of the United States in Maryland. 

The two framework agreements were signed at the White House and were witnessed by President Jimmy Carter. The second of these frameworks ("A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel") led directly to the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. 

Due to the agreement, Sadat and Begin received the shared 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. The first framework ("A Framework for Peace in the Middle East"), which dealt with the Palestinian territories, was written without participation of the Palestinians and was condemned by the United Nations.

Torrijos–Carter Treaties

The Torrijos–Carter Treaties () are two treaties signed by the United States and Panama in Washington, D.C., on September 7, 1977. The treaties guaranteed that Panama would gain control of the Panama Canal after 1999, ending the control of the canal that the U.S. had since 1903. 

The treaties are named after the two signatories, U.S. President Jimmy Carter and the Commander of Panama's National Guard, General Omar Torrijos.

Strategic Arms Limitation Talks

The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) were two rounds of bilateral conferences and corresponding international treaties involving the United States and the Soviet Union, the Cold War superpowers, on the issue of arms control. 

The two rounds of talks and agreements were SALT I and SALT II.

Negotiations commenced in Helsinki, Finland, in November 1969. 

SALT I led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and an interim agreement between the two countries. Although SALT II resulted in an agreement in 1979, the United States Senate chose not to ratify the treaty in response to the Soviet war in Afghanistan.

The agreement expired on December 31, 1985 and was not renewed.

1979 oil crisis

The 1979 (or second) oil crisis or oil shock occurred in the world due to decreased oil output in the wake of the Iranian Revolution. 

Despite the fact that global oil supply decreased by only ~4%, widespread panic resulted, driving the price far higher. 

The price of crude oil more than doubled to $39.50 per barrel over the next 12 months, and long lines once again appeared at gas stations, as they had in the 1973 oil crisis.

1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries

The 1980 Democratic presidential primaries were how voters of the Democratic Party chose its nominee for President of the United States in the 1980 U.S. presidential election.

During the primary race, the country of Iran was going through trouble and unrest. This unrest caused it to make and sell less oil. In January 1979, the leader (or Shah) of Iran left the country. After that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , who was against the Shah’s leadership, took over and made the country follow an extreme version of Islam.

Another problem during the time of this election was increased prices, especially for oil and gas. Many people blamed President Carter. Only 28% of people who were polled said they approved of Carter.

Incumbent President Jimmy Carter was again selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses in the 1980 Democratic National Convention held from August 11 to August 14, 1980, in New York City.

Carter faced a major primary challenger in Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who won 12 contests and received more than seven million votes nationwide. Therefore, Kennedy didn't withdraw from the primary until the second day of the convention. This is the most recent primary where the sitting president still had an opponent at the convention.


1980 Democratic National Convention

The 1980 National Convention of the U.S. Democratic Party nominated President Jimmy Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale for reelection. The convention was held in Madison Square Garden in New York City from August 11 to August 14, 1980.

The 1980 convention was known as it was the last time in the 20th century, for either major party, that a candidate tried to get delegates released from their voting commitments. This was done by Senator Ted Kennedy, Carter's primary challenger for the nomination in the Democratic primaries.

President Carter gave his speech accepting the party's nomination on August 14.

Eradication of infectious diseases

Eradication is the lowering of an infectious disease's numbers in all those suffering from it in the world's population to zero. (It is sometimes confused with elimination of infectious diseases. Elimination of infectious diseases is a very similar idea. Elimination of infectious diseases is the lowering of an infectious disease's numbers in all those suffering from it in a "local" population to zero.) The only human disease to be eradicated is smallpox. The only animal disease eradicated is rinderpest.

Vaccination followed by eradication can make eradication easier. Vaccination was vitally important to the eradication of smallpox. Vaccination was vitally important to the eradication of rinderpest. Vaccination is vitally important to current polio eradication efforts. Vaccination is vitally important to current measles eradication efforts.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) thinks the animal diseases which could be soonest eradicated are African swine fever, Bovine tuberculosis, Foot and mouth disease and "Peste des petits ruminants" (PPR, ovine rinderpest).<ref name="Form global strategies for the control and/or eradication of animal diseases"></ref> A disease which is easier to eradicate is more eradicable. A disease which is easier to eradicate has a higher eradicability.

Only 2 infectious diseases have been eradicated: smallpox has been eradicated in humans and rinderpest has been eradicated in ruminants. smallpox is the only human disease that ha been eradicated. Former President of the United States of America Carter wants to make Guinea Worm the 2nd eradicated human disease. The Carter Center's International Task Force for Disease Eradication (ITFDE) works to achieve this goal.

The current pandemic has slowed many eradication efforts.

Eradication requires many resources. For this reason it is hard to decide whether to eradicate a disease or not. When deciding people consider: Does the disease have a secondary host? (A secondary host will still have the disease if the disease is eradicated in humans.) Can we clearly identify who has the disease? Does an accurate diagnostic exist? Is there enough money? Is there enough political support?

It is possible that eradication of human disease is only possible if humans are the only host.

The Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) is an international public health program. PATTEC works to eradicate "Glossina" and eradicate trypanosomiasis.

Elimination of COVID-19 is only possible if travel is severely reduced. Some experts think this disease may have slightly higher eradicability than polio. The same experts think this disease has much lower eradicability than smallpox. They think this because they did mathematics with scientific data. This is not merely their opinion. The World Health Organization is not certain that vaccines alone will be sufficient.

Some experts believe COVID-19 eradication is impossible.

Some experts believe COVID-19 eradication is possible. The evolution of the Omicron variant has made eradication much more difficult. COVID-19's high evolutionary speed makes eradication difficult.

The World Health Assembly created the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) in 1997. In 1997 the World Health Assembly passed resolution WHA 50.29. WHA 50.29 told the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis to eradicate LF by 2020. The World Health Assembly thinks lymphatic filariasis has high eradicability. The World Health Assembly thinks lymphatic filariasis is one of the most eradicable diseases. The Carter Center International Task Force for Disease Eradication (ITFDE) encourages Haiti and the Dominican Republic to cooperate to do this.

Eradication of malaria is made more difficult by: mosquito resistance to insecticides; political instability in countries with malaria; lack of funding for malaria eradication programmes. Malaria has been eliminated from most of Europe, North America, Australia, North Africa and the Caribbean, and parts of South America, Asia and Southern Africa. Each elimination is a step in the process of eradication. One of the things causing malaria in humans is "P. knowlesi". This parasite makes eradication more complicated. "knowlesi" makes eradication more complicated because "knowlesi"s transmission is different. "knowlesi"s transmission is mostly zoonotic. ("Zoonotic" means that in order to eradicate "Plasmodium knowlesi" we would need to kill all the animals that have it.)

Malaria elimination is easier or harder based upon some things. Those things include: humidity; temperature. One reason for that is the effects of humidity and temperature upon mosquitoes. One reason for that is the effects of humidity and temperature upon "Wolbachia".

Gene drives are a method of malaria eradication. Gene drives are a method of malaria elimination. Gantz "et al.", 2015 created a gene drive for "Anopheles stephensi". Hammond "et al.", 2016.

Malaria has been eliminated in some places. Because the problem is smaller some people are less worried. For this reason funding for malaria eradication has stopped growing. We must understand how to use money appropriately so we can eradicate malaria.

Eradication of avian malaria is also important. This is made difficult by the long term contagiousness of some wild birds. These wild birds include passerines.

The United States of America eliminated malaria in 1951. The National Malaria Eradication Program was the idea of Dr. L. L. Williams. In 2003 there were 8 cases of malaria in Florida. These cases were endemically transmitted. (In this case "endemic transmission" means these infections happened entirely within the same area. Experts determined they didn't come from somewhere else. Endemic transmission is a serious failure of disease elimination.) In 2023 endemic transmission occurred in Florida and Texas. These infections were caused by "Plasmodium vivax". On August 18, 2023 there was an announcement. It was announced that malaria has returned to Maryland. This infection was caused by "Plasmodium falciparum". This announcement shows recognition that Maryland's malaria elimination failed in 2023. It required more than 40 years for this failure to occur. Genetically modified mosquitoes have been released to reeradicate malaria in small areas. Experts believe GM mosquitoes will be used to eradicate malaria from the United States of America.

Malaria was eliminated from Sardinia. This elimination is thanks to the eradication of 3 of 4 mosquito species. These 4 species were Sardinia's native mosquito species. These eradications were done with large amounts of DDT. These eradications were done by a programme. This programme was initiated in 1944. This programme was initiated and funded by the Italian government and the Rockefeller Foundation.

Malaria was eliminated from Europe in 1975.

Malaria eradication is difficult for several reasons. One of those reasons is the difficulty of detecting early infections. The development of technologies to detect hemozoin is making malaria eradication easier. That is due to the fact that hemozoin is among the few things that could be detectable early in the infection process.

In 1988 the World Health Assembly pledged to eradicate polio. In 1988 the World Health Assembly pledged to do this by the year 2000. In 1988 the World Health Assembly created the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). Pakistan's programme has a staff of 339,521. To prevent polio from coming back after eradication we must stop using the oral vaccine and begin only using the inactivated vaccine.

The current pandemic has set back progress in polio eradication.

Eradication of "Dracunculus medinensis" from humans is in progress. No vaccine or medicine is available to help eradicate it. For this reason eradication is done entirely by preventive methods. These preventive methods include: Individuals who suspect they are infected voluntarily report themselves to eradication workers or eradication volunteers; filter vectors of "D. medinensis" out of drinking water; obtain drinking water from water sources which have been improved in ways which keep out "D. medinensis"; prevent individuals infected with "D. medinensis" from wading or swimming in drinking-water sources; eradication workers actively surveil for new cases; eradication workers do case containment when they find an infected individual; eradication vector control; provide water sources which have been improved in ways which keep out "D. medinensis". Methods to improve drinking water sources include: protect hand-dug wells from "D. medinensis"; sink deep-bore wells which are too deep for "D. medinensis"; improve existing surface drinking-water sources to exclude "D. medinensis"; make surface water safe by using sand filters to remove "D. medinensis". Improve existing surface drinking-water sources means: construct barriers to prevent humans with "D. medinensis" from entering the water.

In 2022 the world had made the best progress ever in eradicating this disease.

"Rubella virus" eradication is easier than "Measles morbillivirus" eradication and "Mumps orthorubulavirus" eradication.

"Salmonella enterica" serovar Typhi is also known as "Salmonella" Typhi eradication). Policy makers and decision makers must be aware that elimination efforts have failed many times. Policy makers and decision makers must be aware that eradication efforts have failed many times. Experts expect eradication to take decades.

In 1966 the World Health Organization created the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Programme.

World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the eradication of smallpox "stands as the greatest public health triumph in history."

After smallpox eradication there has been cessation of routine smallpox vaccination. This cessation may contibute to the resurgence of Mpox.

The World Health Organization's "Treponema pallidum" subsp. "pertenue" eradication campaign has dismissed the idea that eradication increases "Treponema pallidum" infections.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Tuberculosis team funds research to eradicate "Mycobacterium tuberculosis". The Bacillus of Calmette and Guérin (BCG) vaccine may help to eradicate this pathogen.

Methods include mass drug administration.

The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis recommends using a combination of 2 methods. These 2 methods are mass drug administration and integrated vector management.

There are many methods of pathogen eradication. Methods include: harming and/or helping secondary hosts. In this case "helping" means giving secondary hosts more disease resistance. (In this case "secondary hosts" are living things other than humans. Those living things can also have the disease we are eradicating.) These secondary hosts include "Aedes" spp., "Anopheles" spp. and white-footed mice. "Aedes" spp. can carry dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. "Anopheles" spp. can carry malaria. White-footed mice can carry the Lyme disease bacterium.

Methods of disease eradication include vector eradication.<ref name="Chapter 6Could we/should we eradicate mosquitoes?">2021. Nancy Leys Stepan. . . Chapter 6 Could we/should we eradicate mosquitoes?</ref> Vectors to be eradicated very frequently include mosquitoes. In 1944 Sardinia had 4 native mosquito species. In 1944 the Italian government and the Rockefeller Foundation initiated and funded a programme. This programme attempted to eradicate Sardinia's mosquitoes. This programme succeeded in eradicating 3 of these species. This programme eradicated by using large amounts of DDT. The results of this programme teach us about what vector eradication does to the environment. Some experts believe this teaches us that vector eradication is not necessarily disastrous. They believe this because eradicating Sardinia's mosquitoes has not produced any ecological consequences.

One example is "Anopheles gambiae": Some experts want to eradicate "Anopheles gambiae". We should eradicate "Anopheles gambiae" because eradicating "Anopheles gambiae" will help eradicate malaria. There are environmental risks associated with eradicating "Anopheles gambiae". Some experts believe we should ignore those risks and do it anyhow. They believe this due to the benefits of eradicating malaria. They believe "Anopheles gambiae" has too little moral value to care about. One very good method of eradication of "Anopheles gambiae" is CRISPR gene drive. It is important to prevent invasion by "Anopheles gambiae". Brazil eradicated "Anopheles gambiae" after the invasion of north eastern Brazil. The invasion was in the 1930s. The eradication was achieved in 1941.

Methods of disease eradication include vector control.

Methods include integrated vector management. ("Integrated vector management" means eradicating diseases by using several other methods. These several other methods are vector eradication methods. "Vectors" are the things carrying the diseases we are eradicating.) Methods include gene drives. Walker "et al.", 2018 did a scientific study. Walker "et al.", 2018 find that mate-finding Allee effects help gene drives to eradicate mosquitoes.

Eradication efforts need more basic research on how vectors and diseases deal with each other. The Carter Center International Task Force for Disease Eradication (ITFDE) has opinions about research. ITFDE gives those opinions in annual reports.

Omar Akbari does research about this. Akbari does this in cooperation with others. Akbari has a laboratory. Akbari has a research group. Akbari supervises some other researchers. Some of these other researchers are Akbari's students. Akbari is a scientist. Akbari researches insect gene drives. Some insect gene drives are "Drosophila" gene drives. Some insect gene drives are mosquito gene drives. Working on "Drosophila" gene drives helps everyone to understand all insect gene drives.

"Plasmodium" oocysts are an important research target for malaria eradication. (These are the eggs.)

Whether governments think other governments will pay their fare share is important in eradication efforts. Governments will be less likely to begin eradication if they think other governments will get the benefits of eradication without having to pay for it.


Anti-German sentiment

Anti-German sentiment (Germanophobia or Teutophobia) is an opposition to, or fear of, Germany, Germans, its culture and the German language. The opposite is called Germanophilia. 

The sentiment began with the mid-19th century unification of Germany, which made the new nation a rival to the Great powers of Europe in economics, military, cultural, and geopolitical grounds. It was believed correctly in other countries that Otto von Bismarck and Helmuth von Moltke were driving Germany towards domination of the European landmass. Bismark unified Germany in 1871 and was their first Chancellor, serving until 1890. 

Von Moltke the elder was chief of staff of the Prussian Army for 30 years. He commanded in the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War. He is described as a "Prussian military organization and tactical genius". He was fascinated with railways and pioneered their military usage. He is often referred to as "Moltke the Elder" to distinguish him from his nephew Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke, who commanded the German Army ("Deutsches Heer") at the outbreak of World War I.

Sunk cost fallacy

A sunk cost fallacy is a fallacy where someone convinces themselves that they should continue doing something because they put in a lot of time and/or effort into it, even if they actually get very little reward out of it. For example, a person might watch the first six episodes of "Battlestar Galactica", but decides they do not like the show. However, because there was a sunk cost, six hours of time, that person tells themselves that because they already spent so much time on it, they might as well finish the show.

An example in the real-world would be pro-war Americans during the Vietnam War. Americans who supported United States' part in the Vietnam War believed that the US already spent so much money, so much time, and so many lives of veterans and civilians that if the United States were to let the communists win the war, then all the loss would have been for nothing.

List of men's national association football teams

This is a list of the men's national association football teams in the world. There are more nations with football teams than for any other sport. Teams represent 191 of the 193 UN member states, as well as several dependent territories, sub-national entities, and states who are not members of the United Nations. This list divides teams into two main groups:

This list excludes other teams that generally play Non-FIFA football. Excluded teams include those who represent ethnic groups, sub-national entities, separatist movements, and micro-nations.

This section lists the current 211 men's national football teams affiliated to FIFA, through their national football associations, and the 12 men's national football teams who have membership in one of FIFA's affiliated continental confederations, but are not members of FIFA. These are displayed in the main list in "italics".

FIFA members are eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup and matches between them are recognized as official international matches. Based on their match results over the previous four-year period, the FIFA World Rankings, published monthly by FIFA, compare how good the national teams are on a point-based system.

Some national teams who are members of a confederation but not FIFA members compete in confederation-level and subregional tournaments. However, These teams are not allowed to participate in the World Cup.

The six confederations are:

FIFA runs the World Cup as a tournament for national teams to find the world champion. Each confederation also runs its own championship to find the best team from among its members:

Although it is not a confederation, the Union of Arab Football Associations (UAFA) coordinates football activities between Arabic-speaking countries. All 22 national governing bodies that form UAFA are also members of both FIFA and either the AFC or CAF. National teams from UAFA member countries are noted in the list below.

The Confederation of Independent Football Associations (ConIFA) is an organization for teams representing unrecognised states, subnational regions, and stateless minorities, as well as teams from recognised states that have not managed to gain entry into FIFA. While none of its current members are also members of FIFA, a few hold associate membership in one of the confederations affiliated with it. These teams are also noted in the list below.

The AFC is subdivided into five sub-federations:

CAF is divided into five regional federations:

The CONCACAF federation is divided into three regional federations that have responsibility for part of the region's geographical area:

The national football teams included in this section are not members of FIFA, or of any of its affiliated continental confederations. These teams are not eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup or any continental confederation championships. FIFA's statutes do not allow member teams to compete against these sides without FIFA's prior permission. Several national associations for teams included in this section are members of ConIFA; these are indicated in the lists below.

This section lists:

There are seven United Nations member and observer states which are not members of FIFA or any of its affiliated continental confederations. Five of them, however, have fielded national association-organised teams in unofficial friendly matches, regional tournaments (such as the Pacific Games or Micronesian Games), or in global tournaments that are not regulated by FIFA. These teams are listed below.

Two other UN member states (the Marshall Islands and Nauru) have never fielded a national association-organised football team, though there are reports that amateur football teams claiming to represent the Nauru national soccer team have participated in local friendly matches on at least two occasions.

Historically, the majority of FIFA and confederation members have been sovereign states with wide diplomatic recognition. Exceptions to this rule include the British Home Nations (due to their small role in the development of football), the Republic of China (which does not enjoy wide recognition but is still accepted as a representative of the Taiwan area), and certain dependent territories, autonomous areas, and protectorates, which have been allowed to hold membership in FIFA and/or one of its affiliated confederations based on their political autonomy, separate status, and/or distance from their parent state. At present, FIFA members include 23 subnational and dependent territories, as well as two states with limited international recognition.

The FIFA-affiliated football teams that belong to non-UN members are:



Ten other overseas, dependent, and autonomous territories with close ties to a sovereign state do not have membership in FIFA, but are members of one of its affiliated confederations.

These national teams no longer exist due to the dissolution of the nation or territory that they represented. Only national teams that were once members of FIFA are listed below.

In addition to the above, other nations have been renamed:

Yuzu (emulator)

Yuzu, stylized as yuzu, was a free and open-source emulator of the Nintendo Switch. Yuzu was announced to be in development on January 14, 2018, 10 months after the Nintendo Switch came out. It is developed in C++.

The emulator was made by the developers of the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra. Both programs use a lot of the same code. At first, Yuzu only supported test programs and homebrew, but as of July 2019, a small amount of games work without any issues. A list of games that work with Yuzu is updated on Yuzu's official website.

On the 26th of February 2024 the Yuzu Emulator officially went down because of Nintendo sueing them for 10 million dollars, deleting its Github and official websites, but since the Emulator was open source there is already a few copies going around like Suyu (pronounced sue you for obvious reasons).

Yuzu used a network service called Boxcat instead of Nintendo's BCAT dynamic content network.

Yuzu allows the resolution to be changed to that of docked mode or undocked mode, or even higher than any of them.

In December 2019, Yuzu added an experimental Vulkan renderer to its Early Access build. As of April 2020, this Vulkan renderer is being used with MoltenVK to continue making Yuzu for MacOS because Apple discourages the use of OpenGL in MacOS.

On May 9, 2020, the development team announced an update that included experimental multi-core CPU emulation.

In October 2018, "Kotaku" published an article saying "Super Mario Odyssey" was playable. The author of the article showed concern Yuzu could emulate games that were available commercially at the time.

"PC Gamer" said Yuzu was able to run shortly after the games came out, but with audio issues.

In October 2019, Gizmodo published an article saying Yuzu could emulate some games at a frame rate at about the same speed as a real Nintendo Switch.

Cannabis in Maryland

In the U.S. state of Maryland, recreational adult use of Cannabis is legal from July 1, 2023. Cannabis is a plant that changes how you think and act when you use it. Cannabis has been legal for medical use since 2014. Since 2014, having 10 grams of cannabis or less meant getting a small penalty. Those who are allowed to use marijuana as a therapy can to visit a dispensary, a place where marijuana is sold. The government organization that regulates the program is known as the "Natalie M. LaPrade Medical Cannabis Commission", or "MMCC".If marijuana products are not covered under an insurance plan, they must be paid for in cash.

Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, the MMCC changed laws and rules about buying medical cannabis to make getting it easier by putting into place social-distancing guidelines, including allowing home-delivery. 

Like in most U.S. states, marijuana possession, use, manufacturing, and distribution had harsh penalties historically. In 2010, about half of all arrests made were for possession of cannabis. In Maryland, African-Americans were about 3 times more likely than Caucasians to be arrested for the possession of marijuana, even though usage of cannabis is similar for most racial populations. African-Americans have received harsher penalties for similar charges than other minority groups.

A referendum on whether or not cannabis should be legalized in Maryland for adults was held in Maryland in November 2022.

Possession of 10 grams of cannabis flower or less can hold a civil offense penalty with a fine not to exceed $100. Having more than 10 grams but below 50 pounds (about 22 kilograms) can have a penalty of a $1,000 fine and up to one year in incarceration. 

The MMCC is the overseeing body of Maryland's medical marijuana program. Governor Martin O'Malley signed legislation that established a medical marijuana program in Maryland in May of 2013. It is named in honor of Maryland Delegate Cheryl D. Glenn's mother who died of kidney cancer at age 87. It is believed that Glenn's mother would have benefitted from medical marijuana therapy. Doctors, nurses, dentists, podiatrists and midwives may permit patients to use and purchase marijuana.

This frog is light brown with darker marks and a dark band down its back and dark stripes from its nose to its armpits. It has a lighter belly. It has orange colouring where its legs meet its body.

This frog lives in forests. It hides in plants and under dead leaves.

This frog lays eggs in streams and swamps. The tadpoles live in slow-moving pools with sunlight.

This frog is in danger in New South Wales because human beings change their forests and streams, because of climate change and because introduced species of fish eat their eggs.

Alberto Santos-Dumont

Alberto Santos-Dumont (July 20, 1873 – July 20, 1932) was a Brazilian pilot and early aviator. He built and flew some of the first airplanes and made some of the first good steering systems for hot air balloons. He is called the "Father of Aviation" in Brazil.

According to the First Flight Society, he was the third person in the world to fly an airplane, after only Wilbur and Orville Wright. He was the first person in Europe to fly an airplane. 

Alberto Santos-Dumont was born in a village named Cabangu in Minas Gerais, Brazil. He was the sixth of his parents' eight children. Santos-Dumont's father had been born in France and trained to be an engineer. He liked to use machines on the family's large coffee farm and became rich. He taught Alberto Santos-Dumont how to use machines too.

For a while, Alberto Santos-Dumont studied at the Colégio Culto à Ciência in Brazil, but when he was 18, his father had an accident that left him unable to move parts of his body. The Santos-Dumont family moved to Europe, and his parents sent Alberto Santos-Dumont to Paris. In Paris, he learned physics and other sciences.

As an adult, Alberto Santos-Dumont was about 1.62 meters tall (5' 4").

At first, Santos-Dumont worked with hot air balloons. One problem with hot air balloons was that they were very difficult to steer. After making a few hot air balloons that could go up and down well, Alberto Santos-Dumont decided to build a good steering system. He built eleven hot air balloons that could be steered, called dirigibles, between 1898 and 1905. His third balloon in this project, "Santos Dumont No. 3", worked. He was able to steer it around the Eiffel Tower and land where he meant to land. His "Santos Dumont No. 6" won the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize.

Santos-Dumont liked to fly his dirigibles around Paris. He became famous and popular, and people copied his clothes and style. United States President Theodore Roosevelt invited him to visit the White House. The French nicknamed him "le petit Santos," or "little Santos," and he became a folk hero in Brazil.

Then Santos-Dumont decided to work on heavier-than-air flying machines, which people call airplanes or aeroplanes today. In the fall of 1906, he tried to fly his biplane, the "Santos-Dumont 14-bis" in a field outside Paris. Experts disagree on exactly what counts as flying and what is only a hop in the air, so perhaps his first flight was on September 13 when the "14-bis" stayed in the air for a short distance or perhaps it was in October when it flew for 50 meters, but everyone agrees that Santos-Dumont did fly in the fall of 1906. On November 12, 1906, outside Paris, he flew the "14-Bis" biplane for 220 meters (722 feet) outside Paris, 6 meters up in the air. The 14-bis used a 50-horsepower internal combustion engine, meaning an engine that burned its own fuel inside itself instead of using steam.

Because many people had come out to watch him fly, because he was already famous, and because the Wright Brothers had not told many people about their own flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903, many people thought Alberto Santos-Dumont was the first person to fly an airplane at all.

Alberto Santos-Dumont made his last flight in 1910. Some time after that, doctors told him he had multiple sclerosis. He committed suicide in Brazil in 1932. Some sources say this was because he was sad that airplanes had become weapons in World War I and other wars.

Alberto Santos-Dumont is part of the First Flight Society's shrine at Kitty Hawk and listed in the Brazilian Air Ministry Almanac.

Some people in Brazil believe Alberto Santos-Dumont was the first person to fly an airplane, before the Wright Brothers. This is for two reasons: First, some people think the Wright Brothers' flight at Kitty Hawk did not count. They believe the Wright Brothers "Flyer" got off the ground but not long enough to count as flying. Others say that the winds at Kitty Hawk helped the "Flyer" too much for the flight to count. Others say that the Kitty Hawk flight did not count because the Wright Brothers used a catapult to get the "Flyer" started. However, the Wright Brothers did not really use a catapult that day, though they did use one with later planes. Second, some people they think the Wright Brothers did fly, but not in 1903 when they said they did. One reason for this is that Alberto Santos-Dumont performed almost all his tests and experiments publicly. Anyone who wanted could watch him work. He often tested his planes with many people watching. The Wright Brothers kept much of their work a secret because they did not want other inventors to steal their ideas. They hoped to patent their work and make money. However, when the Wright Brothers flew their first true plane at Kitty Hawk, they asked five people from the local town and life saving station to come watch and take a photograph. By 1906, the Wright Brothers had flown many of their planes many times, for as far as 39 kilometers. Today, most aviation historians believe that Alberto Santos-Dumont was not the first person to fly.

By flying his dirigible around the Eiffel Tower and landing on purpose, Alberto Santos-Dumont helped convince people that flying machines were not only interesting inventions but that they could be useful in real life. He also invented the "Desmoiselle", a monoplane. That means it was a plane with one set of wings instead of two sets of wings like a biplane. The "Desmoiselle" flew so well that it helped monoplanes become the most common type of plane.

The penetrating object may remain in the tissues, come back out the way it entered, or pass through the tissues and exit from another area. 

An injury in which an object enters the body or a structure and passes all the way through is called a perforating injury, while "penetrating trauma" implies that the object does not pass through.

Santos-Dumont 14-bis

The Santos-Dumont 14-bis was a biplane invented in the early 1900s by Alberto Santos-Dumont. In the fall of 1906, it became the first airplane to fly in Europe.

Santos-Dumont tried several times before he truly managed to fly in the "14-bis". His first attempt in July 1906 did not work. In September, he managed two short hops. In October, the "14-bis" flew for 50 meters. That was the first flight that the Aero Club of France ever officially witnessed. In November, he was able to keep the "14-bis" in the air for 220 meters, 6 meters up in the air.

According to the Aero Club of France, the "14-bis" was 40 feet wide from wingtip to wingtip, 33 feet wide, and weighed 352 pounds. It used an Antoinette engine. It was made out of pine and bamboo with aluminum to keep it together. Its wings were made out of silk cloth. 

The "14-bis" had three different sets of controls so Alberto Santos-Dumont could steer. Some were tied to his shoulders so that he looked like he was dancing or shaking while in the air.

No one knows where the original "14-bis" from the fall of 1906 is now. Experts think Santos-Dumont took it apart and used the pieces to build other airplanes.

Some people, especially in Brazil, believe the "14-bis" was the first airplane to fly, before the Wright Brothers' "Flyer". The main reason for this is that although the Wright Brothers flew the "Flyer" at Kitty Hawk in 1903, they did not tell many people about it right away. Europeans saw Alberto Santos-Dumont fly the "14-bis" in 1906 before they heard about the Wrights flying the "Flyer" in 1903. This was because the Wright Brothers hoped to patent their work and make money, so they kept most of their experiments a secret. Alberto Santos Dumont was not trying to make money, so he invited almost anyone who wanted to come watch him work. However, the Wright Brothers did invite witnesses to their first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903 to watch and take a photograph. By 1906, the Wright Brothers had flown many of their planes many times, for as far as 39 kilometers. Today, most aviation historians believe that the "14-bis" was not the first plane to fly.

Cannabinoid

A cannabinoid is a chemical found in the cannabis (marijuana) plant. There are 113 cannabinoids that scientists know of, but there are likely more. Two of the best known cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is a psychoactive drug, meaning it can make you feel and think differently. Not all cannabinoids are psychoactive and each one works differently. All cannabinoids share a similar chemical structure and are researched for treating diseases.

Cannabinoids work by connecting, or binding, to receptors in the body. These receptors make up a system called the endocannabinoid system (ECS). There are two types of receptors: CB (cannabinoid receptor type 1) and CB (cannabinoid receptor type 2). CB receptors are mostly found in the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain and spine. It is also found in other places in the body like sex organs. CB is found in the peripheral nervous system in other parts of the body. CB receptors are found in the immune system, which is the system that prevents us from getting sick.
Phytocannabinoids are cannabinoids that are found naturally in the cannabis plant are affected by light. They are different than synthetic cannabinoids that are made in a laboratory (lab). When exposed to light, phytocannabinoids can change their chemical structure and turn into other cannabinoids. 

Synthetic cannabinoids are cannabinoids that are man-made in labs. They are used as a drug for research purposes and do not work the same way that natural cannabinoids do. Synthetic cannabinoids are also known as "K2" and "spice". People who have taken synthetic cannabinoids as a drug have gotten very sick and some have died.

Cannabinoids are fatty and oily chemicals that can connect to fat cells in our bodies. This is why it takes a long time to pass a drug test after using marijuana. The "high" feeling that people get when using marijuana depends on if they smoke a marijuana cigarette ("joint"), vape cannabis oils, or eat food with cannabis in it. Most people feel high for a few hours after using cannabis. Cannabinoids that bind to CB and CB receptors get into the bloodstream after being used and can change how the body functions for a short amount of time. 

Some medicines, like Marinol (dronabinol), are carefully made in a lab to help sick people. THC is used to help nausea for people getting chemotherapy. CBD can help people with epilepsy who get seizures. In places, where it is legal, medical marijuana is grown carefully and sold in stores called dispensaries. 

The legality of cannabinoids is different around the world. Many first-world nations have passed laws for people to use marijuana to treat their diseases known as medical marijuana as well as allowing recreational use for adults. Using of having marijuana can be illegal in other countries and be punished with fines, time in jail, or the death penalty. In the United States, psychoactive cannabinoids are illegal on the federal level, but many states have passed laws that allow people to have, use, and grow marijuana. CBD is popular in the U.S. because it is not psychoactive and can be sent in the mail. 

Cannabis has been used for thousands of years. CBD was discovered in 1940. THC was discovered in 1964 by Dr. Raphael Mechoulam and Dr. Yechiel Gaoni in Israel.

Battle of Kaiapit

The Battle of Kaiapit was fought in 1943 between Australian and Japanese forces in New Guinea during the Finisterre Range campaign of World War II. Following landings at Nadzab and at Lae, the Allies attempted to exploit their success with an advance into the upper Markham Valley, starting with Kaiapit. The Australian 2/6th Independent Company flew into the valley from Port Moresby in 13 USAAF C-47 Dakotas, making a difficult landing on a rough airstrip. Unaware that a much larger Japanese force was also headed for Kaiapit and Nadzab, the company attacked the village on 19 September to secure the area so that it could be developed into an airfield. They then held it against a strong counterattack. During two days of fighting the larger force, the Australians suffered relatively few losses. Their victory at Kaiapit enabled the Australian 7th Division to be flown into the upper Markham Valley, stopping the Japanese from threatening Lae or Nadzab, where a major airbase was being developed. The victory also led to the capture of the Ramu Valley, which provided new forward fighter airstrips for the air war.

Wallum sedge frog

The wallum sedge frog or olongburra frog ("Litoria olongburensis") is a frog from eastern Australia. It lives in Queensland and New South Wales.

The adult male frogs is 25 mm long from nose to rear end and the female is 27 to 31 mm long. It is gray, brown or bright green, with blue or orange colour on its legs. It has brown and white stripes and a white belly. It has only a little webbing on the front feet and more on the hind feet. It has large discs on its toes for climbing. It has vomerine teeth in its upper jaw.

This frog lives near the ocean and on islands with sandy soil. It lives in creeks and marshes that have acidic water (pH 2.8-5.5), such as wallums. If the water becomes less acidic, then other frogs move in and eat all the food. Adult frogs climb on sedge plants during the day.

This frog lays eggs in acidic water (pH < 6) in temporary or semi-permanent swamps. They lay eggs 200-1000 at a time near sedge plants.

This frog is also in danger because humans like to build things in the places where they live. Humans like beaches and seashores, so they sometimes walk over the grasses and shore plants where the frog likes to hide during the day. Scientists also think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might be killing these frogs.

Scientists think this frog is also in danger because of invasive species. Plants from other places might change the places where these frogs like to live. Frogs from other places eat all their food. Fish from other places, such as mosquito fish, eat the tadpoles and eggs. Feral pigs can also run through the wallums and damage them. 

Naive set theory

When people started to talk about sets, mostly in the 19th century, they did this using natural language. It uses many of the concepts already known from discrete mathematics; for example Venn diagrams to show which elements are contained in a set, or Boolean algebra. It is powerful enough for many areas of contemporary mathematics and engineering. The term naive set theory is used for this kinds of set theory. It is usually contrasted with axiomatic set theory.

Naive set theory leads to a number of problems:
There is a problem though: All the problems above can only be shown to be problems when axioms can be used to describe sets and their properties.

Richard Dedekind (1831-1916) discovered this and started a new set theory, in 1888. In his set theory, there are axioms about sets. His set theory is not good enough though:

Ernst Zermelo published a set theory in 1908. It uses axioms to define sets, and very much limits the ways in which sets can be made. Together with Abraham Fraenkel he is one of the creators of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the set theory that was used for the much of the 20th century. Because of Gödel's incompleteness theorems this can only be proved for finite sets, though.

When teaching about sets in schools, naive set theory and the definition of Georg Cantor are sometimes used.

Eastern mosquitofish

The eastern mosquitofish, eastern gambusia, or mosquito fish ("Gambusia holbrooki") is a fish that belongs to the Poeciliidae family. It is from the eastern United States but human beings brought it to many other parts of the world, such as Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Australia, where it has caused problems as an invasive species.

The adult male eastern mosquitofish grows to 3.5 cm and the female to 6.0 cm. It is green or brown on top and blue, white or silver on the bottom. It has large eyes and one dorsal fin and a round tail fin.

This fish likes to live in fresh water but can live in water that has some salt. It can survive cold and warm temperatures. It eats insects and their larvae.

People brought the eastern mosquitofish to Hawaii in the 1910s and to Australia in the 1920s and set it free there. They thought it would eat mosquito larvae so there would be fewer mosquitoes. But the eastern mosquitofish did not eat more mosquitoes than the fish that were already in Australia did. The eastern mosquitofish outcompetes other fish and bites their tails or even eats them. It can kill larger fish by damaging their fins. In the western United States, the eastern mosquitofish killed or outcompeted many other fish that were better at controlling mosquitoes than it is. After people put eastern mosquitofish in a body of water, there may be an algal bloom because the eastern mosquitofish eats or kills all the fish that usually eat the algae.

This fish likes to eat frog eggs and tadpoles. It is one reason why the green and golden bell frog is endangered in Australia and the Chiricahua leopard frog in Arizona. 

The fish has 50-300 eggs at a time. The eggs stay inside the female's body until they hatch. It takes the new fish two months to become adults. Eastern mosquitofish can do this several times each year.

The western mosquitofish "G. affinis" and eastern mosquitofish "G. holbrooki" used to both be called "G. affinis" because people thought they were the same species. They are not. According to the IUCN Global Invasive Species Database, most records in Australia that say ""G. affinis"" really refer to "G. holbrooki".

Elizabethan collar

An Elizabethan collar, also called a, e-collar, lampshade or cone of shame is a piece of equipment used in veterinary medicine. They stop the animal from licking or biting its body and from scratching or touching its head with its feet.
The veterinarian places the collar around the neck of an injured animal so that it cannot bite or lick the injured part of its body. For example, a dog with a cut on its skin might need medicine placed directly on the cut. The dog might try to lick the medicine and poison itself. An animal that has had surgery might try to pull out its stitches. An animal with a broken leg might bite into its cast and try to pull it off. If it is wearing an Elizabethan collar, it cannot do this. 

Some pet owners say their pets find it difficult to eat, drink and play while wearing an Elizabethan collar. Veterinarians sometimes try other collars, like those made out of cloth, collars that look like inner-tube-shaped cushions, and collars that act more like a neck brace, stopping the animal from moving its head.

Elizabethan collars are named after Elizabethan ruffs, stiff, starched collars that people wore in 1500s England.

Today, most Elizabethan collars are made out of plastic. In the 1800s, they could be made out of wood or leather.

The Kingdom of Kotte (Sinhala: කෝට්ටේ රාජධානිය "Kottay Rajadhaniya"), centered on Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte , was a kingdom that flourished in Sri Lanka during the 15th century.

Parakramabahu VI first became the king of Raigama in 1412, then in 1415 he made Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte his capital. The King upgraded the existing citadel and built a new royal palace. Parakramabahu VI waited until ties between the Vijayanagara Empire and Jaffna Kingdom were severed. First he captured the Vanni and made its leaders loyal to him. Sapumal Kumaraya was the commander of the Kotte army at the time. Tamil served as one of the court languages of the Kotte kingdom at this time.

Medicaid

Medicaid in the United States is a federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by Medicare, including nursing home care and personal care services.

Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to 74 million low-income and disabled people (23% of Americans) as of 2017.

Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, states had the option to expand Medicaid coverage to nearly all low-income people under the age of 65. Eligibility for children was extended to at least 133% of the federal poverty level, and states now have the option to cover adults with income levels at or below 133% of the federal poverty level. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded coverage so that more Americans have access to health insurance—which includes mental health treatment coverage. Under the ACA, both mental and behavioral health disorders are covered similarly to physical health disorders. This includes the treatment of substance use disorders.

Satyatma Tirtha

Sri Satyatma Tirtha, is an Indian Hindu philosopher, guru and scholar. He is the Swamiji of the Sri Uttaradi Matha, a Matha belonging to the Dvaita school of philosophy, founded by Sri Madhvacharya. Sri Satyatma Tirtha is the 42nd in the lineage of the Uttaradi Matha, starting from Madhvacharya. Satyatma Tirtha was born in Mumbai, India. He is the founder of Vishwa Madhwa Maha Parishat.

Shri Satyatma Tirtha, through Uttaradi Math, encouraged water harvesting and management expert, the "waterman of India" and Ramon Magsaysay Award winner Rajendra Singh to give lecture on water conservation and other topics. Through Uttaradi Math and jointly with Vishwa Madhva Maha Parishat, he is instrumental in helping needy students every year to the tune of Rs.5.00 lakhs (About US$10,000).

He has supplied relief materials to flood victims of Bellary, Bijapur, Raichur and Bagalkot districts during 2009 floods and also took measures to construct 100 low cost houses to those who lost houses in the flood. He has also adopted a rural village in Raichur, Karnataka for integrated development of the village. He is reportedly trying to redefine the role of religious 'math' in modern day society, so that present day 'math' should try to get rid of evils of modern society.

His spiritual discourses ("pravachana") attract large gatherings, mainly from followers of Madhvacharya and he specialises in talks on Vedic subjects. He has given spiritual discourses at several places like Bangalore, Gulbarga, Malkheda, Udupi, Rajahmundry, Hyderabad (India), Pune, Raichur, Dharwad and Chennai. He has also conducted personality development programmes and has written several books on topics like personality development, religion and philosophy. Satyatma Tirtha, as the present head of Uttaradi Matha, has also encouraged other authors to write books on religious experiences.



Portuguese Ceylon

Portuguese Ceylon is the name given to the part of Ceylon, modern-day Sri-Lanka, controlled by the Portuguese Empire between 1597 and 1658.

The first contact was established by Dom Lourenço de Almeida in 1505–6. It was largely accidental and it wasn't until 12 years later that the Portuguese sought to establish a fortified trading settlement.

The Portuguese wanted to control commerce, not territory. They were later drawn into the internal politics of the island with the political upheaval of the Wijayaba Kollaya. They used this to their advantage during the Sinhalese–Portuguese War, first in an attempt to control the production of cinnamon. Direct Portuguese rule did not begin until after the death of Dharmapala of Kotte, who died without an heir, and had bequeathed the Kingdom of Kotte to the Portuguese monarch in 1580. That allowed the Portuguese a claim to the Kingdom of Kotte upon Dharmapala's death in 1597. Portuguese rule began with much resistance by the local population.

Eventually, the Kingdom of Kandy sought help from the Dutch East India Company, with whom they entered into agreement. After the collapse of the Iberian economy in 1627, the Dutch–Portuguese War saw the Dutch conquest of most of Portugal's Asian colonies - Ceylon included, between 1638 and 1658. Elements of Portuguese culture from this colonial period remain in Sri Lanka.

Medicare (United States)

Medicare is a national health insurance program in the United States. It began in 1965 under the Social Security Administration (SSA) by Lyndon B. Johnson and now administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). It gives health care insurance for Americans aged 65 and older, people with End-Stage Renal Disease and also for some younger people with disability. Medicare consists of three parts:

Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance): Covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, hospice, and some home health care.

Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance): Covers doctor office visits and services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventative care and services.

Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage): Covers the cost of prescription drugs, flu shots, and vaccines.

Medicare Advantage is part of the Medicare program offered to older people and disabled adults who qualify. Also referred to as Part C plans, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are provided by private insurance companies instead of the federal government. They include the same Part A hospital and Part B medical coverage that Original Medicare provides but not hospice care. Most MA plans also include Part D prescription drug coverage. Anyone who joins an MA plan still has Medicare.

The average monthly premium for a Medicare Advantage plan in 2021 is expected to drop 11% to about $21 from an average of $23.63 in 2020. Private companies receive a fixed amount each month for Medicare Advantage plan care. In turn, these companies can charge out-of-pocket costs to policyholders and are able to establish their own rules for service such as the need for referrals or provider networks for both non-urgent care and emergency services.

Regional preferred provider organizations (PPOs) were established to provide rural beneficiaries greater access to Medicare Advantage plans and cover entire statewide or multi-state regions. Regional PPOs accounted for 5% of all Medicare Advantage enrollees in 2020. About 24 million people, or 36% of those receiving Medicare benefits, were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan in 2020. That number is expected to climb to more than 26 million in 2021.

Medicare Parts A and B include coverage for addiction treatment, including alcohol rehab. According to Medicare Interactive, a website that provides information on Medicare plans, Medicare Part A can help pay for hospitalization for substance abuse treatment, while Part B can help cover treatment for partial hospitalization or outpatient addiction treatment services.

In addition, Medicare Part D provides coverage for medications used in treating alcohol addiction, such as naltrexone, as long as these drugs are considered medically necessary for the policyholder.


Dutch Ceylon

Dutch Ceylon existed from 1640 to 1796. It is called in Sinhala. 

In the early 17th century, Sri Lanka (which was called Ceylon at the time), was divided between the Portuguese, and several local kingdoms. The kingdoms were fighting against each other very often. Although the Portuguese were not winning the war, their rule was rather burdensome to the people of the areas they controlled. At some point, the king of Kandy asked the Dutch for help. The Dutch East India Company ran the country. Even though they managed to control large areas near the coast, they did not control the mountain areas and the Kandxan kingdom in the center of the island. The Dutch interest in Ceylon was to have a stronghold against the Iberians (Spanish and Portuguese) at the time.

In October 2020, it was revealed that Cunningham had an affair early in the year and sent sexual text messages to his mistress. This was controversial and affected his polling lead against U.S. Senator Thom Tillis weeks before the election. Cunningham lost the election to Tillis on November 10.

British Ceylon

Ceylon (Sinhala: , "Brithānya Laṃkāva"; Tamil: பிரித்தானிய இலங்கை, "Birithaniya Ilangai") was the British Crown colony of present-day Sri Lanka between 1815 and 1948. Initially the area it covered did not include the Kingdom of Kandy, which was a protectorate, but from 1817 to 1948 the British possessions included the whole island of Ceylon, now the nation of Sri Lanka.

Among Us

Among Us is an American science-fiction social deduction game made by Innersloth LLC. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror movie "The Thing". It was released for iOS and Android on June 15, 2018, for PC on Steam on November 16, 2018. It was also released on itch.io on August 17, 2018. "Among Us" follows a crew being killed one at a time by one or more Impostors. The game got very popular in late 2020 because many Twitch streamers and YouTubers have played it.

In December 2021, Innersloth announced that there would be a virtual reality version of the game, called "Among Us VR".

In "Among Us", players play as one of four to fifteen players, and can either be a "Crewmate" or an "Impostor". Each game has a minimum of one Impostor, and a maximum of three Impostors in it. The number of Impostors can be changed at the start of the game.

Crewmates are given a list of tasks to complete at the start of the game. They can win if everyone does their tasks, or if they vote out all the Impostors.

Impostors can win by killing all the Crewmates, or killing enough Crewmates so that there are more Impostors than Crewmates. They do not have tasks, but instead can pretend to do tasks. Impostors can pretend to complete these tasks to make it seem like they are not Impostors. Impostors can travel around the map using vents, and "sabotage" parts of the map (such as causing a reactor meltdown on The Skeld) to distract or kill other Crewmates.

Every player has a chance to call an emergency meeting or, when they see a fallen body, to report it to everyone else. During a report meeting, players can talk about who they think is the Impostor. This is the only time when players can talk to each other and vote. If a player gets the most votes, they are voted out, meaning they are kicked out from the game. Among Us does not let players use voice chat. Players can only talk by typing messages, so because of this, many players use services like Discord for voice chat.

When a player is killed by the Impostor, or if they are voted out, they become a ghost. Ghosts can not do things with other players, and they can not talk or vote during meetings. However, they can still do tasks, and see the rest of the game. Ghost Impostors can also sabotage to help their teammates. If both the Crewmates and the ghosts complete their tasks, the Crewmates will win. If the Impostor kills everyone or if the Crewmates run out of time on certain sabotages, the impostor wins.

"'The Skeld"' is the very first map in Among Us. It was released with the game, and is the most popular map. It used to be the only free map in the game. It is set in a simple spaceship.

"'Mira HQ"' is the second map in the game. Unlike The Skeld, the map was released as paid content. It is set in a floor in a floating building that is the headquarters of the company MIRA. It was announced on August 3, 2019, and it was released on August 8, 2019. This map has new features such as new tasks, a decontamination system and a door log.

"'Polus"' is set in a base in a planet named Polus. This map, like "Mira HQ", was also released as paid content. This map does not have vents for the Impostor, but holes that connect the different buildings. This map is big and open unlike the other maps. It also has a new camera system. Most tasks/features in this map are only in this map.

"'The Airship"' is the fourth map in the game. It was announced at The Game Awards on December 10, 2020. It is based on The Henry Stickmin Collection, another game Innersloth worked on. It was released on 31 March 2021 for free.

The game received mainly positive reviews but some criticized the game because 'after a while, you just see the same old maps', while on Steam the game received 'very positive' reviews.

Among Us got a lot more popular in the summer of 2020, because a lot of Twitch streamers started streaming themselves playing it. At some point making it the most viewed category on Twitch. There were so many new players causing servers to go down, even though they were designed for having multiple players. Developers decided to redesign servers as a result.

The game became popular because of YouTube creators making videos on it. Many other Twitch streamers and YouTubers who began playing the game included xQc, Pokimane, xChocoBars, Bretman Rock, Ninja, MrBeast, Disguised Toast, Sykkuno, Valkyrae, Corpse Husband, Fuslie, Jacksepticeye and PewDiePie.

The game got popular in some countries like South Korea and Brazil before getting popular worldwide. According to ForteBass, Twitch streamer Sodapoppin first popularized the game worldwide on Twitch in July of 2020.

The game's popularity continued into the following months. The COVID-19 pandemic also raised its popularity. The game popularized the slang word "sus" (a shorter way of saying suspicious).

The game also had many internet memes that were inspired by the game. Some others words such as Sussy, Sussy Baka (baka meaning fool), "When the imposter is sus", and "Amogus" became popular memes. Memes about random or otherwise strange things such as trash cans, fire alarms, and backpacks looking like the Impostor, usually in red also became popular.

AS Val

The AS also referred to as "Val" is a special assault rifle designed (created) by the Soviets. It has a built-in suppresor. The development began in the first half of the late 1980s in the Central Research Institute of Precision Engineering, in the city of Klimovsk part of the Moscow region. The lead designer of the rifle is Pyotr Serdyukov.

TsNIITochMash (Central Institute for Precision Machine Building) developed it in 1987. Since 1987, the Soviet Army and the KGB used it in their arsenal. Russian Spetsnaz special forces and some divisions of the Russian Army also use it.

The AS is expensive and there are not many available. It is not used often according to many Russian Spetsnaz operators. It is used during special operations by either sabotage or reconnaissance units deployed behind enemy lines. 

The AS and VSS are very effective. Some Russian army and special forces units, and Moscow’s intelligence and security forces still use it. Forces used the rifles during the last years of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. They were also important in the Chechen wars and the conflict in Georgia.

Most recently, Russia used the weapon during military operations in Crimea and Syria.

The AS has an effective range of about 300 m. It uses heavy subsonic 9×39mm SP-6 (high-performance armor-piercing) ammunition (which weigh down the bullet). It also uses the SP-5 ball cartridge used by the VSS Vintorez suppressed sniper rifle. It can also use the same 10- or 20-round magazines of the VSS and the 30-round magazine of the SR-3M. Controls are similar to all AK-type rifles. It has a charging handle on the right side, a tangent rear sight, a magazine release button behind the magazine well, and a safety lever above the trigger guard. The fire selector is located within the trigger guard, behind the trigger.

The rifle has two modes of fire: semi-automatic and fully automatic fire. It has a cyclic rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute (RPM). According to its users, the AS is reliable, accurate, and well liked.

The rifle has an AK-type side mount for various optical sights. For example, it has the 4x PSO-1 scope and night sights such as the 1PN51 calibrated for use with the 9×39mm cartridge. The standard open sights are graduated up to 400 m in 25 m increments.

The AS shares 70% of its components with its sister-gun, the VSS Vintorez. The differences are a skeletonized steel stock which folds to the left for storage and transportation (the gun can operate with stock folded, but it cannot have a scope while the stock is folded).

The reliability of the rifle is said to be equivalent to the AKM. This includes functioning in difficult conditions such as dust, dirt, sand, rain, and at a temperature range from -50 °C to +50 °C.

Mosquitofish

The mosquitofish ("Gambusia affinis"), also named the mosquito fish, western mosquitofish, western gambusia, or live-bearing tooth carp, is a fish in the Poeciliidae family. It is from the southern and midwestern United States and east coast of Mexico. Human beings brought it to many other places, for example Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Australia. It has caused problems as an invasive species. Some scientists say that the western mosquitofish has had the largest effect on the environment of any fish in the family Poeciliidae.

The adult male western mosquitofish grows to 4 cm and the female to 7 cm. It has a round tail fin. It eats algae, insects, and other invertebrates. It can eat more than its own body weight every day. It can live in water that is twice as salty as seawater. It can live in water as hot as 43°C. The western mosquitofish usually has 60 eggs at a time, but it can have as many as 300 at a time. The eggs stay inside the female's body until they hatch.

In the early 20th century, human beings caught western mosquitofish and took them to other places. They did this because they thought the western mosquitofish would eat mosquitoes and their young. This did not work. Sometimes there were more mosquitoes than before: The western mosquitofish killed other fish that were eating mosquitoes. It did this by either eating the other fish, killing them without eating them, or eating so much of the food that the other fish died. The western mosquitofish sometimes killed fish that were better at killing mosquitoes than it was. It also ate some of the insects that had been eating the mosquitoes and mosquito young. It also ate zooplankton, which left more food for the mosquito young to eat themselves.

The western mosquitofish can kill larger fish by biting their fins and eating their eggs and babies. It kills and eats smaller fish. It kills frogs by eating their eggs and tadpoles. After people put western mosquitofish in a body of water, there may be an algal bloom because the western mosquitofish kills all the fish that usually eat algae. The western mosquitofish is one reason why many other species are endangered. Some of the important ones are the Gila topminnow ("Poeciliopsis occidentalis"), and the damselfly in Hawaii.

The western mosquitofish "G. affinis" and eastern mosquitofish "G. holbrooki" used to both be called "G. affinis" because people thought they were the same species. They are not. According to the IUCN Global Invasive Species Database, most records in Australia that say ""G. affinis"" really mean "G. holbrooki".

Oxygen-16

Oxygen-16 (O) is a stable isotope of oxygen, having 8 neutrons and 8 protons in its nucleus. 

Spetsnaz

Spetsnaz is an umbrella term (used for many different things) for special forces in Russian language and is used in numerous post-Soviet states.

Historically, the term meant a special operations units controlled by the main military intelligence service GRU (Spetsnaz GRU). It also describes task forces of other ministries (such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs' ODON and Ministry of Emergency Situations' special rescue unit) in post-Soviet countries. Russian special forces wear different berets depending on the branch of the armed forces they belong to.

As Spetsnaz is a Russian term, it mostly means the special forces of Russia, but other post-Soviet states often refer to their special forces units by the name as well, since these nations also got their special purpose units from the old Soviet security agencies.

During the Second World War, it Soviet forces needed intelligence on German troop positions in northern Norway and Finland. On 5 July 1941 Admiral Arseniy Golovko of the Northern Fleet authorized the formation of a ground spy troop. This unit, the 4th Special Volunteer Detachment, was to be recruited from the fleet's sports-men and had about 65 to 70 personnel. Later the unit was renamed the 181st Special Reconnaissance Detachment.

The most prominent of these new recruits was Viktor Leonov, who joined the Soviet Navy in 1937. He was assigned to a submarine training detachment and then moved to a repair station in the Northern Fleet at Polyarnyy. Leonov had trained as a scuba diver, after which he joined 4th Special Volunteer Detachment, where he conducted numerous secret operations and twice being awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

Initially the unit was confined to performing small scale reconnaissance missions, platoon sized missions by sea and on occasion on land into Finland and later Norway. They began conducting sabotage missions and raids to snatch prisoners for interrogation. They would also destroy German ammunition and supply posts, communication centers, and harass enemy troop concentrations along the Finnish and Russian coasts.

When the European conflict ended, the Naval Scouts were sent to fight the Japanese. Leonov along with Capt. Kulebyakin and 140 men, landed on a Japanese airfield at Port Vonsan, not realizing they were opposed by over 3,500 enemy soldiers. A tense standoff ensued, until the commanding officers of the unit managed to bluff the Japanese forces into surrendering.

"For further details about the Soviet conflict during Afghanistan War see here."

Soviet Spetsnaz forces took part in the Soviet–Afghan War of 1979–1989 in Afghanistan, usually fighting battles using helicopters. Their most famous operation, Operation Storm-333, was carried out on 27 December 1979 when Soviet special forces stormed the Tajbeg Palace in Afghanistan and killing Afghan President Hafizullah Amin and his 200 personal guards. The Soviets then installed Babrak Karmal as Amin's successor.

The operation involved approximately 660 Soviet operators dressed in Afghan uniforms, including 50 KGB and GRU officers from the "Alpha Group" and "Zenith Group". The Soviet forces occupied major governmental, military and media buildings in Kabul, including their primary target – the Tajbeg Palace.

In the first one and a half years of the war, Spetsnaz units in the form of the 459th special forces company, were exclusively responsible for recon missions and intelligence gathering for the 40th Army. Aside from reconnaissance, the 459th was also tasked with capturing prisoners, destroying the leaders and field commanders of the Mujahideen.

By 1985, the GRU had expanded its special forces footprint to two spetsnaz brigades in Afghanistan, comprising just under 5,000 troops.

Lamborghini LM001

The Lamborghini LM001 is an off-road vehicle made by Lamborghini in 1981. It was first revealed at the 1981 Geneva Auto Show along with the new-at-the-time Lamborghini Jalpa. 

The LM001 was made for military use, but only one prototype was ever made. This was because the rear-engine design made the car handle poorly.

Even though the previously made Lamborghini Cheetah was a failure, Lamborghini still wanted to make an off-road military vehicle. The Cheetah concept was redesigned into the LM001. Unlike the Cheetah's Chrysler engine, the LM001 prototype had a 134 kW 5.9-litre AMC-built V8. The V12 from the Countach was supposed to be used for production models.

A12 autoroute

Sanmiguelia

Sanmiguelia is a genus of fossil plants. It may be among the earliest angiosperms. It was identified by imprints of palm-shaped leaves originating from the Triassic geological period (251 to 199.6 million years ago). They were found in rocks from Colorado . 

The leaves were ellipsoidal and wrinkled, up to 40 cm long and 25 cm wide, and were at the apex of a tapered or spindle-shaped stem. 
According to these data, it belonged to a possible family flowering plants " Sanmigueliaceae ", unknown order, in class Magnoliopsida, division Tracheophyta.


Incitatus

Incitatus was Emperor Caligula's favorite horse. He lived in Ancient Rome around 40 CE. His name means "fast-moving" in Latin.

There is a story that Caligula made his horse a senator, but it is probably not true. According to historian Mary Beard, no ancient historian who was alive at the same time as Caligula ever said Caligula really made Incitatus a senator, and it is likely that he only told a joke about doing it.

Ancient historians do say Caligula gave his horse many gifts. In 121 c.e., in his book "The Twelve Caesars", the historian Suetonius says of Incitatus: "Besides a stall of marble, a manger of ivory, purple blankets and a collar of precious stones, he even gave this horse a house, a troop of slaves and furniture, for the more elegant entertainment of the guests invited in his name; and it is also said that he planned to make him consul."

In Robert Graves' 1934 book "I, Claudius", the fictional Caligula does make the fictional Incitatus a senator and gives him an ivory trough to eat out of. This is one of the ways Graves shows that Caligula has become mentally unstable. After Caligula dies, Claudius treats Incitatus like a normal horse again.

A talking version of Incitatus appears as a villain in Rick Riordan's 2018 young adult novel "The Burning Maze".

Lamborghini Cheetah

The Lamborghini Cheetah is an off-road prototype that was made by Lamborghini in 1977.
The Lamborghini Cheetah was the first off-road vehicle made by Lamborghini. It was designed to be used by the military. The design of the Cheetah was largely a copy of Food Machinery Corporation (FMC)'s XR311 prototype, which was developed for the military in 1970. This resulted in legal action from FMC against Lamborghini in 1977.

The Cheetah was built in San Jose, California. After it was built, the prototype was sent to Sant'Agata Bolognese so Lamborghini could put on the finishing touches. The Cheetah was powered by a large, waterproofed 180 bhp 5.9L Chrysler engine, rear mounted, with a 3 speed automatic transmission. The mounting of the engine in the rear gave the Cheetah very poor steering, and the engine was not powerful enough for the Cheetah. This resulted in poor performance overall.

The only finished prototype was never tested by the US military. It was later sold to Teledyne Continental Motors, and it still exists today. 

Lamborghini eventually developed the Lamborghini LM002. The LM002 had a similar design to the Cheetah, but it had a 12-cylinder motor from the Lamborghini Countach mounted in the front.

Lamborghini 350 GT

The Lamborghini 350 GT is a sports car made by Lamborghini from 1964 to 1966. It is the first road car made by Lamborghini. The 350 GT was based off the Lamborghini 350GTV prototype. Both cars used a 3.5-liter V12 engine. 

The Lamborghini 400 GT was the successor to the 350 GT.
After testing his Lamborghini engine in May 1963, Giotto Bizzarrini, who was the head engineer at Lamborghini, left the company. The following month Ferruccio Lamborghini told engineer Gian Paolo Dallara to build a road-car version of Bizzarrini's 350GTV. Dallara was helped in this project by engineer Paolo Stanzani and test driver Bob Wallace.

Dallara and Stanzani quickly realized that the 350 GTV was not made well for mass production. They decided to build the 350 GT as a road-car version. First, they began de-tuning the original Bizzarrini engine and redesigning the original Bizzarrini chassis for street use. They then started getting the 350 GTV ready for its late-October 1963 Turin Auto Show debut. Lamborghini hoped its debut would raise interest in the 350 GT. The 350 GT was released in 1964. It was Lamborghini’s first road car.

The 350 GT was powered by a V12 engine. Each engine was tested for 24 hours on a Schenk Walge dynamometer. In the tests, it was run for the first 12 hours under electric power, and then with gasoline at increasing speeds. The test revealed that the engine produced at 6500 rpm and of torque at 4500 rpm.

The engine was paired to a five-speed manual transmission which was made by ZF.
The 350 GT had a kerb weight of . With its V12 engine, it could accelerate from in 6.8 seconds, and from in 16.3 seconds. It also had a top speed of .

The Lamborghini 350 GTS was a convertible version of the 350 GT. That meant it had a roof that was able to open. The 350 GTS was first shown at the 1965 Turin Auto Show. Two of them were built by Carrozzeria Touring in 1965. The convertible top was designed to be concealed (hidden) in the storage area behind the two seats when it was folded down.

The Blank Slate

The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature is a popular 2002 book by the psychologist Steven Pinker. The author makes a case against tabula rasa (the idea that people are born with no mental content). The book was voted for the 2003 Aventis Prizes. It was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

Pinker says that modern science has challenged three linked ideas that make up the main view of human nature in intelligent life:


Much of the book is looking at fears of the social and political consequences of his view of human nature:


Pinker says that the blank slate view of human nature would actually be more of a threat if it were true. He says that political equality does not require similarity, but policies that treat people as individuals with rights. Moral progress doesn't need the human mind to be naturally free of selfish actions, only morals to counteract them are needed. Responsibility doesn't need behavior to be uncaused, only that it answers to praise and blame. Grounding ideals in claims about a blank slate opens them to the possibility of being overturned by future discoveries. A blank slate is not in-sequence with opposition to many social evils since a blank slate could be conditioned to enjoy slavery.

Evolutionary and genetic inequality statements do not have to support right-wing policies. If everyone is equal regarding abilities it can be argued that it is only necessary to give everyone equal opportunity. If some people have less ability, then redistribution policies should favor those with less ability. Economics is built upon an assumption of an actor, while evolutionary psychology suggests that people have many different goals and behaviors that do not fit the actor theory. "A rising tide lifts all boats" is often used as an argument that inequality need not be reduced as long as there is growth. Evolutionary psychology suggests that low status itself, apart from material considerations, is highly stressful towards the brain and may cause dangerous behaviors, which suggests that inequalities should be reduced. Evolutionary explanations may also help the left create policies with greater public support, suggesting that people's sense of fairness (caused by mechanisms such as reciprocal altruism) rather than greed is a primary cause of opposition to welfare.


Avanti West Coast

Avanti West Coast is a British train operating company. It operates the West Coast Partnership franchise and has done since 8 December 2019, where it took over from Virgin Trains. 

The company is owned by Scottish-based company FirstGroup and Italian company Trenitalia.

"Avanti" means "Forward" in Italian.

It currently operates services mainly up the West Coast Main Line. These services are between London and various other towns and cities around Great Britain. These include direct trains to Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Wolverhampton, Shrewsbury, Chester and Blackpool. They also operate services between London and Holyhead, Wrexham or Bangor in North Wales.

There were plans for future services to Walsall, Llandudno Junction and the village of Gobowen in Shropshire from 2022.

Journeys with Avanti were very popular with commuters as the trains do not call at every station and only stop at some stations along their route. However, due to this, tickets for travel with them can be expensive. They were badly affected by the 2022–2023 United Kingdom railway strikes. There was often only one train an hour when there should have been three. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham said he would ask the then Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, to take the contract off Avanti West Coast.

Burmese amber

Burmese amber, or Burmite or Kachin amber, is amber from the Hukawng Valley in northern Myanmar. It is important for its fossils from the earliest part of the Upper Cretaceous, in the Cenomanian age, 99 million years ago. The amber has been commercially exploited since the first century AD. Research on the deposit may fund internal conflict in Myanmar. 

The amber has flora and fauna especially arthropods such as insects and arachnids. There are also also birds, lizards, snakes, frogs and fragments of dinosaur remains. 

The fossils arachnids in the amber include:
15 families of myriapods are in the amber

8 families of Entognatha are known

29 orders of insects are known, including:
And 16 more smaller families.

Other groups of invertebrates include:

There are some vertebrates:


Peron's tree frog

Peron's tree frog or emerald-spotted tree frog ("Litoria peronii") is a frog from Australia. It lives in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, but people have also seen it in a few other places.

The adult frog can be as big as 65 mm long from nose to rear end. It lives in forests, grasslands and swamps. It has sometimes been seen in northwestern Australia, far from its natural range. Citizen scientists from Frogwatch SA think this is because people keep Peron's tree frogs as pets and then they either escape or are set free. This frog is usually gray-green during the day. It turns red-brown with green spots at night. It has black and yellow colouring on its legs. It looks very similar to Tyler's tree frog. Scientists tell them apart because their voices sound different.

This frog lays eggs in temporary bodies of water. The tadpoles are yellow with stripes.

Reassortment

Reassortment is mixing of the genetic material of a species into new combinations in different individuals. 

There are several ways this happens. The term is used when two similar viruses infecting the same cell exchange genetic material. In particular, reassortment occurs among influenza viruses. Their genomes have eight segments of RNA. These segments act like mini-chromosomes: each time a flu virus is assembled, it needs one copy of each segment.

A single host (a human, a chicken, or other animal) may be infected by two different strains of the influenza virus. Then it is possible that new assembled viral particles will be made from segments whose origin is mixed, some coming from one strain and some coming from another. The new reassorted strain will share properties from both parental lineages.

Reassortment is responsible for some of the major changes in the history of the influenza virus. The 1957 and 1968 pandemic flu strains were caused by reassortment between an avian virus and a human virus. The H1N1 virus responsible for the 2009 swine flu pandemic has an unusual mix of swine, avian and human influenza genetic sequences.

There are other examples, but this is enough to indicate why reassortment causes such dangerous illness. 

If any of a virus’s genome segments is damaged in such a way as to prevent replication or expression of an essential gene, the virus is inviable when it, alone, infects a host cell (single infection). However when two or more damaged viruses infect the same cell (multiple infection), the infection may succeed due to reassortment of segments. Each of the eight genome segments may be present in at least one undamaged copy.

Cleon

Cleon (; "Kleon", ; died 422 BCE) was an Athenian politician and general known for his support of the Peloponnesian War. The historian Thucydides writes that Cleon was a demagogue and that he once ordered the Athenians to massacre an entire city for rebelling against Athens.

Cleon also dragged Aristophanes to court to prosecute him for his play The Babylonians. Aristophanes at the beginning of his next play The Acharnians said he would have revenge on Cleon. Aristophanes also wrote a comedy called The Knights to try and convince the people not to re-elect Cleon and another called The Wasps about Cleon being a populist.

According to Aristotle, Cleon was the first one who would shout down anyone who disagreed with him and accuse any and all opponents of being essentially traitors to ‘the people’ and who did everything he could to convince the people that the only way for them to have power was to let him do what he wanted even if it were against the Constitution.

Vomitorium

A vomitorium is a hallway or alcove found in ancient Roman buildings. It is called a vomitorium because it can allow many, many people to enter or leave the building at the same time. The word in Latin means "place from which things spew forth," or "place that things come out of quickly."

Romans built vomitoria in theaters and stadiums. One building could have many vomitoria on each floor. Some modern theaters and stadiums also have vomitoria. In the 1980s, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival added vomitoria to its Allen Elizabethan Theatre so they could do more things with entrances and exits.

Because the name sounds like "vomit" in English, people in the 1800s and 1900s thought a vomitorium was a special room that ancient Romans would go to during feasts. They would throw up in that room to empty their stomachs so they could return to the feast and eat more. But this is not true. Ancient Romans did not build special rooms to vomit in.

Battle of Gaugamela

The Battle of Gaugamela (also called The Battle of Arbela) was a battle fought between Alexander the Great and the first Persian empire. The battle was fought in 331 BC. It was in Gaugamela, a village on the banks of the river Bumodus, north of Arbela (modern-day Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan). It led to the fall of the Achaemenid Empire and of Darius III.

Before this Darius had lost the Battle of Issus where his wife, his mother and his two daughters were captured. 

Alexander's small army, about 47,000, had marched through Mesopotamia. The Persian army was certainly bigger, though there is no agreement about how big it was. They had 15 Indian elephants and some scythed chariots - war chariots with scythe blades mounted on each side. These didnt make much difference. 

After the battle Darius was murdered by Bessus, the Satrap of Bactria.

Oka Crisis

The Oka Crisis was a time in Canadian history when there was a disagreement between a group of Mohawk people and the town of Oka in Quebec, Canada over land. It lasted 78 days and led to the death of one person. The Oka Crisis is a well-known example of violent conflict between a First Nations group and the Canadian government.

The Mohawk people were in the Montreal area starting from the 1700s. In 1717, some land in the Montreal region was given to the Roman Catholic Church to use as a seminary. Part of this land included a Mohawk burial site. In 1868, Joseph Onasakenrat, a leader of the Mohawk, wrote a letter to the seminary that said that part of the land was meant for the Mohawk people to use. A year later, he and some other Mohawk attacked the seminary but were unable to get the land in the end.

In 1936, the seminary sold off the land the Mohawk claimed was theirs.

In 1959, the town of Oka let a golf course be built on part of the disputed land. The Mohawk filed a lawsuit but it didn't go through.

In 1977, a group of Mohawk called the Kanehsatà:ke band filed a land claim with the Office of Native Claims. By filing a land claim, they wanted to be accepted as the owners of the land. They were unable to successfully file a claim.

In 1989, the golf club said they wanted to expand the golf course. The Mohawk people protested and took the club to court.

In 1990, the court approved of the expansion of the golf course.

The Mohawk set up barricades so that no one could get to the golf course. The mayor of Oka, Jean Ouellette, told them to get off but they refused.

On July 11, Mayor Ouellette called the Quebec provincial police to the town.

Although the Mohawk did not get the land, the golf course was not expanded.

Killing of Vanessa Guillen

Vanessa Guillen was an American soldier. On April 22, 2020, she went missing from an army base called Fort Hood, which is in the state of Texas. She was later found dead not far from Fort Hood.

Her family believes that her disappearance is a result of crime because of previous instances where she said that she was being sexually harassed. They also believe that the US Army is not doing a good job in solving her case.

On July 3, 2020, the main suspect in the case, another soldier named Aaron David Robinson, killed himself. Another suspect, Cecily Anne Aguilar, is in jail as of July 6, 2020.


Fort Hood has a big problem with soldiers disappearing. Also, there is a big problem with sexual harassment in the armed forces of the United States.





Vanessa's family is not happy with the investigation. They say that the US Army has not been investigating Vanessa's disappearance seriously.

Natalie Khawam, who is the lawyer representing the Guillen family, criticized the Army for not doing more to ensure Vanessa's safety.

Many Americans are sad and angry because of Vanessa's disappearance. They are also concerned about the amount of sexual harassment occurring in army ranks. Many past soldiers have used the hashtag #IAmVanessaGuillen to tell their stories about being harassed and assaulted.

There have been many protests demanding that Vanessa be found and brought back to her family. In addition, many celebrities and politicians are talking about Vanessa's case and how to reduce sexual harassment in the armed forces.

The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), which represents the interests of Hispanic Americans, told Latina women to not join the US military so that they can avoid the same fate as Vanessa Guillen. They said that the military does not do a good job of protecting women, especially women of color.

2020 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection

This article listed possible candidates for the Democratic nomination for Vice President of the United States in the 2020 election.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee for President of the United States, will choose his running mate at some point before the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

Biden promised to select a woman, which make it the third time in United States history that the vice presidential nominee of a major party has been a woman, after Geraldine Ferraro (1984) and Sarah Palin (2008).

On August 11, 2020 Biden picked U.S. Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate.

Vetting is the process of beginning to search and or hire a person for an important job. In this case, vetting is the process of Biden's campaign looking for a running mate. The Biden campaign was reported to have begun the vetting process of potential running mates in May 2020. In July 2020, Biden said that "I am not committed to naming any but the people I've named, and among them are four Black women".

At first, Biden hoped to announce his running mate the week of August 5, 2020, however his campaign has pushed the announcement date to before the DNC Convention would start, which would be August 16 or before. "The New York Times" reported on August 10, that an announcement of who Biden picked as his running mate will happen either August 11 or August 12.

His running mate vetting process has been criticized for Biden's campaign alleged "blatant disrespectful" treatment towards black women and sexism.

On June 26, 2020, CNN and "The Washington Post" reported that the following five individuals were the leading candidates for the nomination. On July 29, just a week before Biden's planned announcement, "The Hill" reported that Karen Bass, Harris, Rice, and Warren had emerged as the "top tier" of candidates. On August 2, CNN reported that Tammy Duckworth and Gretchen Whitmer were also still under consideration. 
The following six individuals were originally cited to have begun undergoing vetting by the Biden campaign in May or June 2020, but it is uncertain whether they have moved on to further stages in subsequent months or not. 
Following the George Floyd protests, Amy Klobuchar was criticized for her lack of prosecution of police misconduct during her tenure, including a case involving the officer accused of murdering Floyd. On June 18, she announced that she had removed herself from consideration and urged for Biden to select a woman of color. 
The following individuals publicly confirmed that they had declined to be vetted by the Biden campaign.

Pinocchio frog

The Pinocchio frog or northern Pinocchio treefrog ("Litoria pinocchio") is a frog from the island of New Guinea. It lives in the Foja Mountains in Indonesia.

This frog is green, brown and yellow in color. The male frog has a point on the end of its nose. The point can get bigger or smaller at different times, but scientists do not know exactly why.

Scientists saw that the point on the male frog's nose becomes bigger while the male frog is singing, so they think it might be part of impressing female frogs. Other scientists think it makes it easier for Pinocchio frogs to recognize other Pinocchio frogs and tell them apart from other frogs that look similar and live in the same place.

The Pinocchio frog is named after the fictional character Pinocchio, a puppet whose nose becomes bigger whenever he tells a lie. Scientists have known the Pinocchio frog existed since at least 2008. It was first formally described, meaning scientists wrote the first scientific paper about it, in 2019.

Vomitoxin

Vomitoxin is a group name for many natural poisons made by fungi from the genus "Fusarium". These fungi grow on grains, such as wheat, rice, barley, and corn. The vomitoxin can stay in the grain. Things made out of the grain, such as flour, beer, or other food, may have vomitoxin in them. If humans or other animals eat the food, they can become sick with vomiting, dizziness, pain, and other problems. These problems usually stop after some time.

There are more than 140 different vomitoxins. The three most common are deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, and T-2 toxin.

Deoxynivalenol does not break apart when it gets hot. It can be cooked at 350°C and still stay a poison. Some forms of cooking, like boiling, do help against deoxynivalenol. This is because the deoxynivalenol moves out of the grain into the water, and the water is thrown away.

Scientists believe that deoxynivalenol does not cause cancer.

Animals that eat grain or other food with vomitoxin in it usually do not die, but they do usually eat less. That makes them grow less.

Animals that eat grain that has vomitoxin in it can have the vomitoxin stay in their bodies. Chickens fed vomitoxin lay eggs with vomitoxin in them. Pigs fed vomitoxin have meat with vomitoxin in it. Cows fed vomitoxin give milk with vomitoxin in it. However, there is usually less vomitoxin in the animal product than in the grain that the animal ate.

Vomitoxin and the fungi that make it cost farmers money. According to Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development, "Fusifarum" in wheat and other crops cost C$50 million to $300 million each year in Canada alone from 1994 to 2014.

Farmers can do several things to prevent vomitoxin from getting into food. They can use crop rotation, plant seeds that have been checked to have no "Fusarium" in them, plant types of crops that are strong against "Fusarium", and put fungicide on the crops to kill the fungus. Because fungal infections make the crop plants smaller and lighter, sometimes farmers can use combine harvesters to blow air on the crops so that the infected wheat blows away leaving the heavier healthy wheat behind.

Murder of Pamela Buckley and James Freund

James Paul Freund (September 16, 1946 – August 9, 1976) and Pamela Mae Buckley (December 16, 1951 – August 9, 1976), formerly called the Sumter County Does and Jock Doe and Jane Doe were two people who died by homicide – a man and a woman. They were killed on a small dirt road in a rural part of Sumter County, South Carolina on August 9, 1976. They were named as Pamela Buckley and James Freund on January 21, 2021, at a press conference. They were both shot three times in the same way. Twice in the chest, and once in the back. They were shot with a .357 caliber revolver.

The male victim, James, was aged 29. It was guessed he was between 18 and 30 before his name was known. One dentist said he thought he could have been older than 27. His skin was an olive white colour and he had brown eyes and brown hair down to his shoulders. He was over tall and weighed around . He had a lot of work done to his teeth that was probably done outside the United States. He also had many scars on his back and shoulders, meaning he might have played contact sport. He was wearing faded Levi jeans and a red T-shirt. The shirt had the words "Coors — America's Light Beer" on the front and "Camel Challenger GT Sebring '75" on the back. It also had a Snoopy design. The shirt came from the Sebring Races being held at the time in Sebring, Florida, meaning he may have been there. He was wearing no underwear and had a pack of matches in his pocket from a "Grant's Truck Stop". This truck stop is thought to be in the Midwestern United States. He also had a ring on with the letters "JPF" written on the inside. This could refer to his initials James Paul Freund.

The female victim, Pamela Buckley, was thought to be younger than the male one, aged between 18 and 25 years old before her name was known. It was later found out that Buckley was 24 years old.

Nikolai Kapustin

Nikolai Girshevich Kapustin (Russian: Никола́й Ги́ршевич Капу́стин; November 22, 1937 – July 2, 2020) was a Ukrainian composer and pianist. He was born in Horlivka, Ukrainian SSR. His works are 20 piano sonatas, six piano concerti, other instrumental concert, sets of piano variations, and concert studies.

Kapustin died on July 2, 2020 in Moscow at the age of 82.

At the age of seven, he learned piano with Professor Avreliana Hryhorovycha Rubbakha (1895—1975), a student of Felix Blumenfeld, who also taught Symona Barera and Volodymyra Horovytsya. Rubbakha was the first serious teacher for Kapustin, and together they worked hard for 11 years. While he was learning, Kapustin fully went through the path of becoming a pianist of the classical type, playing works by Bach, Clementi, Scarletti, Liszt, Beethoven, and passing various scales, arpeggios, etc. on technical tests.

When he was 18 years old he went into the Moscow Conservatory on piano in the class of Holʹdenveyzera Oleksandra Borysovycha. Kapustin remembered that the relationship with such a famous person affected him and his development as a pianist. Borysovycha was 82 years old at the time, and he could not to provide adequate technical teaching to his student. During the work, the teacher remembered the past a lot, sharing interesting facts and his thoughts on composers. Borysovycha was touched at how full of motion the music of Mykoly Hirshovycha was, what he could do with the piano, deeply respected and loved his student.

For some time, Kapustin dreamed of becoming a super good pianist and performing classic pieces, but not on big stages, but in a more cozy place or recording in studios. But at about the age of 20, the pianist started to like in jazz.

In 1957, the Orchestra of the Central House of Artists and Kapustin played at the VI International Festival of Youth and Students, which was in Moscow. At that time, the festival had 34,000 people in it who stood for 131 countries. The festival was the biggest ever. And it was here, on the world stage, that Kapustin had his work played for the first time, the Concertino for piano and orchestra (which he wrote in the same year). It was then that the composer found his style in the natural mix of classical structure mixed with jazz improvisations (making up things you play), harmonies, rhythms, chords, etc.

Not only did he learn at the big school, Kapustin played with a small jazz band in high types of restaurants for people who were not Ukrainians. One of these light concerts was recorded and later on the radio "Voice of America" began to play it again.

In 1961 Kapustin left the Moscow Conservatory.

Between the years 1961–1972, he worked together with Oleha Lundstrema's orchestra. During his work with the orchestra, it turned out that Kapustin was very good pianist who practiced a lot and a very great composer, writing a number of new works.

In 1972–1977, he was pianist of the Blue Screen Orchestra. He also played in the State Symphony Orchestra of Cinematography of Ukraine.

The end of the 70's was Kapustin's change from playing to writing different types and lots of music. He wrote many works of many different forms for orchestra and piano alone.

His works were published with the help of Stivena Osborna and Mykola Petrov. Kapustin's piano pieces were added in the set of works and recorded by Mark-Andre Amlen, Mykola Petrov and others. And so was why Kapustin's music all around the world. The composer himself has again and again recorded very good playing his own works.

On December 11, 2007, a concert for the composer's work was held in Moscow. Kapustin was there. March 8, 2009 in the Chamber Hall of the Moscow Conservatory was a concert of his works, which he also went to, who answered many questions from fans of his work.

Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)

Henderson Island is an uninhabited island in the south Pacific Ocean. The island was also called San Juan Bautista and Elizabeth Island in the past. With Pitcairn, Oeno and Ducie Islands it forms the Pitcairn Island Group.

It is one of the world's last two raised coral atolls whose ecosystems remain relatively unaffected by human contact. A 2017 survey found a large amount of plastic debris on its beaches. Ten of its 51 flowering plants, all four of its land birds and about a third of the identified insects and gastropods are endemic – a remarkable diversity given the island's size.

The island is small: it measures by . It has an area of . It is located northeast of Pitcairn Island. It has poor soil and little fresh water. This makes it unsuitable for agriculture. There are three beaches on the northern end. The rest of the coast is made of steep cliffs up to in height.

In 1902 Henderson was added to the Pitcairn Islands colony. The Pitcairn Islands are a South Pacific British Overseas Territory. United Nations made it a World Heritage Site in 1988. 

Archaeological evidence suggests that a small permanent Polynesian settlement existed on Henderson at some time between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. The reasons, why the group disappeared from the island are unknown. At about the same time, Polynesians also left Pitcairn Island. The group on Henderson would have depended on the group on Pitcairn for many things of daily life; there's no stone suitable for making tools on Henderson. The Pitcairn Polynesians may in turn have disappeared because of the decline of nearby Mangareva; Henderson was at the end of a chain of small, dependent colonies of Mangareva.

On 29 January 1606, Portuguese captain Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, was the first European to see the island, and named it "San Juan Bautista". He was leading a Spanish expedition at the time. Captain Henderson of the British East India Company ship "Hercules" rediscovered the island on 17 January 1819. Thomas Raine (1793-1860), master of the ship "Surry" of London, had called it ""Henderson's Island"" as it appeared to him from the conversation he had with James Henderson at Valparaiso to be his discovery on his last voyage to India from that port in the ship "Hercules". On 2 March 1819, Captain Henry King, in the "Elizabeth", landed on the island to find the king's colors already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship into a tree.

A sperm whale rammed and sank the Nantucket whaleship Essex on 20 November 1820. The crew arrived at Henderson on 20 December in three small whaleboats. They found the island's only known drinkable water-source – a brackish spring on the north shore, exposed at half tide – and ate fish, birds, eggs, crabs and peppergrass, but they had largely exhausted the available food within a week. On 27 December the three boats set sail for South America, leaving behind Thomas Chappel, Seth Weeks, and William Wright, who chose to stay. They survived until their rescue on 9 April 1821. In his account of the ordeal, Chappel reported having seen human skeletons in a cave. The report of sperm whale ramming the ship may have inspired Herman Melville to write "Moby-Dick"

In August 1851, visitors from Pitcairn Island also found skeletons in a cave and wreckage on the beach next to the cave. After a party of Pitcairn Islanders collecting miro wood rediscovered the skeletons in March 1958, a medical examination determined that the bones were of Caucasian origin, and they were then buried in a shallow grave inside the cave. An American survey team examined the bones in 1966 and buried them in five coffins in the left-hand corner of the cave, tightly jamming a large cross between the ceiling and the rock floor at the entrance. They concluded the remains were of five or six people, one of whom was between three and five years of age. It was presumed they were the survivors of a shipwreck who died of dehydration.
A final examination in the context of a scientific expedition in 1991 concluded that the human remains on Henderson Island were prehistoric Polynesians.

In 1902, Henderson Island, along with Oeno and Ducie islands, was formally annexed to the British Empire by Captain G. F. Jones, who visited the islands in a cutter with a crew of Pitcairn Islanders. In August 1937, HMS Leander, on a journey from Europe to New Zealand, carried out an aerial survey of Henderson, Oeno and Ducie, and on each island, a British flag was planted and an inscription was nailed up proclaiming: "This island belongs to H.B.M. King George VI." 

In 1957, a 27-year-old American, Robert Tomarchin, lived the life of a castaway on the island for approximately 2 months, accompanied by a pet chimpanzee, apparently as a publicity stunt, until people from Pitcairn rescued him in two longboats.

In the early 1980s, conservative American businessman Arthur "Smiley" Ratliff expressed interest in establishing a mansion for himself on the island, with an airstrip. The Pitcairn Island Council approved his plans but, after environmentalists lobbied to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office overrode the decision and vetoed the proposed development. Henderson Island was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1988.

Since the introduction of aluminum-hulled long-boats in the 20th century, Pitcairners have made regular trips to Henderson to harvest the wood of "miro" and tou trees. Usually, they go to Henderson once per year, but they may make up to three trips if the weather is favourable. Pitcairners carve the wood into curios for tourists, from which they get much of their income.

Henderson Island is a raised coral atoll. With Pitcairn, Ducie and Oeno islands, forms the Pitcairn Island Group. The nearest major landmass is more than away. This coral limestone island sits atop a conical (presumed volcanic) mound, rising from a depth of roughly . Its surface is mostly reef-rubble and dissected limestone. Except for the north end, the island is encircled by steep limestone cliffs up to high.

There are three main beaches, on the northwest, north, and northeast shores. The north and northwest beaches are on the border of reefs. The depression at the island's center is thought to be a raised lagoon. There is only one known source of drinking water on the island: a brackish spring on the north shore exposed at half tide, rising from a crevice in flat rock, large surfaces of which compose the face of the beach. The surrounding ocean tidal range is about one meter at spring tide.

Apart from five species bordering the beaches, including coconut palms, the vegetation is undisturbed. Henderson Island is covered by 5–10 m tall tangled scrub forest. There is less forest in the central depression. It has 51 native species of flowering plants, ten of which are unique to the island (endemic). Dominant tree species include coconut palms, "Pandanus tectorius"," Thespesia populnea" (miro), "Tournefortia argentea", "Cordia subcordata" (tou), "Guettarda speciosa", "Pisonia grandis", "Geniostoma hendersonense", "Nesoluma st.-johnianum", "Hernandia stokesii", "Myrsine hosakae", and "Celtis sp."

The island is presently home to four endemic land bird species – the Henderson fruit dove, Henderson lorikeet, Henderson reed warbler and the flightless Henderson crake. Three species of the family Columbidae were formerly endemic to the island. They became extinct when the Polynesians arrived around 1000 CE. Of the fifteen non-endemic seabird species found, nine or more probably breed on the island. Breeding colonies of the globally endangered Henderson petrel formerly existed on Ducie but were wiped out by invasive rats by 1922. It is believed to now nest uniquely on Henderson island.

Bones of birds have been found near the prehistoric settlements. These settlements existed 500 to 800 years ago. The bones found include those of two species of bird that still visit the island, but do not nest there: The Christmas shearwater and red-footed booby. There are alos bones of four bird species that can no longer be found on the island at all. Polynesian settlers may have driven these bird species, along with six terrestrial snail species to extinction on the island. This loss of a ready and regular food supply may have contributed to the Polynesians' disappearance. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area for its endemic landbirds and breeding seabirds.

The invertebrate species are largely unknown but a third of the island's known non-marine gastropods and insects are endemic. There are no native mammals but the Pacific rat, introduced by Polynesians 800 years ago, abounds. A skink and the green sea turtle have been identified, and an unidentified gecko has been reported. There are also crabs.

Land bird populations appear to be relatively stable. The big problem is that when yachts land on the island without authorization, they introduce new predators, disease vectors or diseases. Introduction of the Eurasian black rat or the domestic cat would be likely to cause almost immediate extinction of the ground-dwelling Henderson crake and possibly other species. The endemic birds may have no immunity to the fatal avian pox which is transmitted by biting flies.

Between July and November 2011 a partnership of the Pitcairn Islands Government and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds started a program to eradicate the Pacific rat using poison. The program was very successful. Before the program, between 50.000 and 100.000 rats lived on the island. The poison killed almost all of them. Between 60 and 80 rats survived and the population has now fully recovered.

Research published in April 2017 looked at debris on several beaches, and reported "the highest density of plastic rubbish anywhere in the world" as a result of the South Pacific Gyre. The beaches contain an estimated 37.7 million items of debris. There weight is estimated at 17.6 tonnes. When a study was done on North Beach, each day 17 to 268 new items washed up on a 10-meter section of the beach. The study noted that purple hermit crabs make their homes in plastic containers washed up on beaches; the debris may reduce shoreline gastropod diversity, may contribute to a reduction in the number of sea turtle laying attempts and may increase the risk of entanglement for coastal-nesting seabirds.

Prosperity theology

Prosperity theology is a religious belief that if the believer is wealthy and in good health, this is always the will of God. It is most common among certain groups of Protestant Christians. It is also known as prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, the gospel of success, or seed faith. These groups also believe that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology sees the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.

The doctrine says that it is God's will for his people to be blessed. The atonement is interpreted to include the healing of sickness and lessening of poverty. Both are curses that can be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.

Groups in favor of prosperity theology started in the United States in the 1950s. The origins may go back to a movement callled New Thought, which started in the 19th century. The basic ideas were important for another movement, called Word of Faith. In the 1980s televangelism was sometimes successful because of these ideas. In the 1990s and 2000s, prosperity theology was adopted by influential leaders in the Pentecostal Movement and Charismatic Movement in the United States and has spread throughout the world. Prominent leaders in the development of prosperity theology include E. W. Kenyon, Oral Roberts, A. A. Allen, Robert Tilton, T. L. Osborn, Joel Osteen, Creflo Dollar,[8] Kenneth Copeland, Reverend Ike, and Kenneth Hagin. 

Leaders from other Christian novements have critiziced prosperity theology: They say that it is irresponsible, promotes idolatry, and is contrary to scripture. Secular as well as some Christian observers have also criticized prosperity theology: They say it exploits the poor. The practices of some preachers have attracted scandal and some have been charged with financial fraud.

Notable works that advocate prosperity theology include:[8]

Tongva means “people of the earth.”

The word Tongva comes from the word "Toviscangna", which is a Tongva village located near Mission San Gabriel. However, the Tongva call themselves Kizh (keech).

The Tongva were forced onto Spanish missionaries to learn about Christianity and the European lifestyle. The Tongva lived in shelters called "kiches". The "kiche" was dome-shaped. The frame was made of willow branches and was covered with mats made with reeds, grasses, or animal hides. The Tongva lived in villages with as many as 400–500 "kiches". A chief lived in the largest "kiche" and had almost total authority over the village. The position was passed down through the chief’s family.

The Tongva hunted, fished, and gathered food. They liked to eat acorns. They would mash the acorns and then process it so that it would taste better. They also hunted deer and small animals such as birds, rabbits, and rodents.

The Tongva once spoke the Tongva language but most of them now speak English and Spanish. However, they are trying to use the Tongva language more. One way they are doing this is by having Tongva classes.

The Tongva language was the source of many place names in the Los Angeles region. Some of these places are: Topanga, Tujunga, Cucamonga, etc.

There are two groups of Kumeyaay, the Ipai and the Tipai. Ipai land is in what is now the United States while Tipai land is mostly in what is now Mexico.

The word Kumeyaay is pronouned KOOM-yai. The KOOM part rhymes with loom and the yai part rhymes with pie. Some people pronounce Kumeyaay in three syllables and add an extra "uh" between KOOM and yai.

The Kumeyaay were also called Diegueño, which is a Spanish word that comes from Mission San Diego. However, this is not the name they call themselves.

The two different groups of Kumeyaay are called Ipai (EE-pie) and Tipai (TEE-pie). They both mean "human" in the Ipai and Tipai languages.

The Kumeyaay speak three languages. They are Tipai, Ipai, and Kumeyaay. Now, most of them speak English and Spanish.

In the 1760s, the Spanish came onto Kumeyaay land. They wanted to teach the Kumeyaay about the Christian religion and the European lifestyle. To do that, they built the Mission San Diego, which was a church, a school, and a village.all in one. However, the Kumeyaay did not like being told what to do. In 1775, the Kumeyaay fought the Spanish at Mission San Diego. They set some buildings on fire and killed a priest.

When the Kumeyaay land became part of Mexico, there was no one to send money to the missions to keep them running so the Kumeyaay left.

When part of Kumeyaay land became part of the United States, the Kumeyaay were sent to live on certain pieces of land called reservations. Many of these reservations now have casinos so that the Kumeyaay people can make money.

Most Kumeyaay are now Catholic. Many parts of their old religion were forgotten when they became Catholic. However, they still remember some parts.

In the traditional Kumeyaay religion, a dead person's soul must cross a deep gorge in order to get to heaven.

Navajo language

The Navajo language (Navajo: "Diné Bizaad") is a Southern Athabaskan language that is spoken in the United States, specifically in the Navajo Nation (in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah). It is the most widely spoken Native American language in the US and the most spoken Indigenous language in the Americas north of the US-Mexico border. In 2011, almost 170,000 Americans spoke Navajo at home. Navajo is famous for being used by the Navajo Code Talkers during World War II (Pacific Theater).

Compared to many other languages, the Navajo language has a lot of sounds, including many that are not found in the English language. Navajo is also a tonal language, like Chinese, which means that pitch is used to make words different from each other. English is not a tonal language. For these reasons and many more, many English speakers find it difficult to learn Navajo.

In Navajo, new words are made by adding prefixes and suffixes to a part of a word called the stem. These prefixes and suffixes add meaning, such as tense, who is doing the action, and so on. In Navajo, sentences are arranged as subject-object-verb although they can be arranged in other ways too.

Navajo does not have a lot of loanwords from other languages.

The Navajo language is written with the Latin alphabet, just like English. The current alphabet was developed in the 1930s. Before this, the Navajo did not have their own alphabet.

The Navajo do not call themselves or their language "Navajo." The word "Navajo" is from the Tewa word "Navahu", which means "large field" ("nava" "field" + "hu" "valley"). The Tewa are another group of Native Americans and speak their own language. That Tewa word eventually made it into the Spanish language, where it referred to an area in New Mexico. That Spanish word then was used in English to refer to the Navajo people, who live in New Mexico.

The Navajo call themselves "Diné", which means "people." They call their language "Diné bizaad" ("people's language). They also call their language "Naabeehó bizaad," which is based on the word "Navajo."

Navajo is part of the Athabaskan language family. A language family is a group of languages that are related to each other and come from a common ancestor language. For example, English is part of the Indo-European language family because it has a lot of similarities with languages spoken in Europe, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Navajo is one of the most southernmost Athabaskan languages. Other Athabaskan languages are spoken in Alaska and on the Pacific coast.

Like many other Athabaskan languages, Navajo has tones. However, the tones evolved independently in different languages. For example, what is a "high" tone in Navajo is a "low" tone in other Athabaskan languages and vice versa.

The Western Apache language is the language that is most closely related to Navajo. They share a lot of the same tones and a lot of words. Navajo is similar to other Apachean language.

The ancestors of the Navajo are thought to have come from the northern US and Canada, because other Athabaskan languages are spoken in those places. Archaeologists think that the Navajo came to the Southwest by 1500.

Starting in the 1800s, the Spanish colonized the Navajo territory as part of Mexico. Then the US took over the area after the Mexican-American war. After that, American settlers came and set up schools to teach the Navajo about English and Christianity. They did not allow the Navajo to use their language in order to make them learn English. Children were forced to wash out their mouths with soap if teachers found them speaking Navajo. Because of this, many parents were afraid to teach their children the language.

Robert W. Young and William Morgan (Navajo) were two men who worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. They created a single alphabet for the Navajo language. Before then, there were many alphabets used to write down the Navajo language.

A white American man who lived with the Navajo recommended that the language be used as a code language during World War II. Back then, there were no Navajo dictionaries and very few non-Navajo spoke the language. Also, the Navajo language is very different from German and Japanese, the languages of the enemies at the time. The military started to recruit Navajo men to become code talkers. These code talkers sent code messages in Navajo. The code talkers used very specific words for military words (such as "iron fish" for submarine) so that even other Navajo would have a hard time understanding if they didn't learn the meanings of those terms. The Japanese found out they were speaking Navajo because a professor who studied Native American languages recognized it, but they could not understand the words of the code. There were other code talkers in other Native American and non-Native American languages, but the Navajo Code Talkers were the most famous.

After World War II, the Navajo language began to decline. More roads were built into Navajo land, which exposed them more to English. However, things began to change in the 1960s. President Johnson signed a law that said that kids who don't speak English are allowed to have bilingual education. That was when the Navajo began to open up schools that taught in both English and Navajo.

Today, Navajo is considered to be a language in trouble because more and more of the Navajo now speak English only. However, people are working to change it by speaking and writing in Navajo and teaching the language to other people.

In Navajo, new words are created by putting prefixes in front of other words.

Navajo is called a subject-object-verb language. This means that the subject is first and the verb is last ("I you love"). This is different from English, which is a subject-verb-object language ("I love you").

Verbs (action words) are the most important part of Navajo grammar. Every sentence needs a verb. Each verb is composed of a root, with additional prefixes and suffixes attached to form a word.

Nouns are people, places, and things. They are not as important in Navajo. Many nouns are created by adding certain prefixes and suffixes to verbs. 

Unlike in some other languages, Navajo nouns do not have grammatical gender. They also do not change in the plural (unlike English, which usually adds the suffix -s to indicate plural nouns). 

Navajo nouns are organized as animate (people, plants, and animals) or inanimate (everything else).

In the Navajo language, possession is not indicated by 's or words such as my. Instead, prefixes are added to the beginning of words. (Example: chidí 'car' - shichidí 'my car')

Navajo does not have adjectives. Verbs play the role of adjectives.

The Navajo words for million (miiltsoh), billion (binyóón), and other large numbers are based on English.

The Navajo borrowed the 7-day week from the Spanish. The first day of the week is Sunday, which is "Damóo". This comes from the Spanish word for Sunday, "Domingo".

The Navajo language uses the ABCs, just like English. Before, the Navajo language had no writing system. As missionaries came, they made up their own alphabets. However, some linguists came up with a single alphabet that represented the sounds of Navajo well. This alphabet has lots of extra letters and marks so that all the sounds of the Navajo language can be written correctly.

Below is a chart of all the Navajo letters.

The hooks underneath the letters are called ogoneks and represent nasal vowels. Nasal vowels are not found in English, but they are found in languages like French and Portuguese.

High tones are represented with a mark called an acute accent, such as á.

Chuck E. Cheese (character)

Charles Entertainment "Chuck E." Cheese is the anthropomorphic rat mascot of the Chuck E. Cheese chain of family entertainment centers. In 2012, the rat mascot was rebranded into a mouse.

The character was first created as the mascot for a restaurant made by Nolan Bushnell (founder of Atari) in 1977. Bushnell went to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) conference in Orlando and saw walk-around character costumes being sold. In them, Bushnell found one that looked like a coyote, so he bought it for his planned Coyote Pizza restaurant. When the costume arrived at Atari, the costume was actually a rat, with a long pink rat tail. Bushnell decided to change the restaurant's name to Rick Rat's Pizza. However, Bushnell's planning group thought that a rat for the name of a restaurant would not be appropriate. Finally, Bushnell's group decided on the name Chuck E. Cheese for the mascot and changed the restaurant's name to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre. The first Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre opened in San Jose, California, in the same year Chuck E. Cheese was made, 1977.

In 1995, the mascot was given a more child-friendly makeover, with wider cheeks, a less pointy, shorter snout, longer eyes and smaller ears. This one was added to the restaurants in 2001.

In July 2012, the mascot was changed into a much smaller kind of the character, who played electric guitar. Voice actor Duncan Brannan, who for 19 years had made Chuck E. Cheese a wise-cracking mouse from New Jersey, was replaced with Jaret Reddick, the frontman and guitarist for the pop punk band Bowling for Soup.

Edward N. Lorenz

Edward Norton Lorenz (May 23, 1917 – April 16, 2008) was an American mathematician and meteorologist. He was one of the first to work in the field of Chaos theory. He was the first to use the term Butterfly effect for dynamic systems that are very sensitive to starting conditions. In the 1960s, he used a simple model for weather prediction, which he simialated on a computer. With this setup, he discovered that only a slight change of the values he used for the model could lead to totally different results. This is known as Butterfly effect. In numerical weather predicion, values are often rounded, so that in each step, a small error is added.

He also discovered and developed the mathematical foundations. For his simulations he used a system of equations, which is now named after him.

Love Thy Neighbour

Love Thy Neighbour is a British TV comedy series that first aired on UK TV between April, 1972 - January, 1976. It centres on a white working class couple (Eddie and Joan Booth) and their black, Conservative-voting neighbours (Bill and Barbie Reynolds). The programme spans eight series and 53 episodes, including a pilot episode. 

The ongoing racial conflict between the husbands of the two couples is the main underlying theme of the programme, with the white husband perceived as more bigoted and ignorant. Their wives are seen as more tolerant. A spin-off film with the same name was made in 1973 and later a sequel series was set in Australia, featuring only the Eddie Booth character. The series was produced by Thames TV for the ITV network.

Eddie Booth (Jack Smethhurst) is a working-class white socialist. His world changes when Bill and Barbie Reynolds move in next door. He is a bigoted person and his racial slurs are aimed mainly at Bill. He often describes Bill as a "nig nog", "Sambo" and '"King Kong". He also has a tendency to call Chinese, Pakistanis or Indians names like "Fu Manchu", "Gunga Din" and "Ali Baba". He often asserts that all blacks (and Bill in particular) are cannibals and claims that "the white man always takes precedence over the black man".

Joan Booth (Kate Williams) is Eddie's wife. She is more tolerant towards her neighbours. In fact, she gets very on well with Barbie, Bill's wife, and they are often seen together discussing the animosities between their husbands.

Bill Reynolds (Rudolph Walker) is a supporter of West Ham United. Whenever Eddie tries to outdo him, Bill usually ends up having the last laugh and rarely gets his comeuppance. He tends to have a very short temper, especially where Eddie's concerned and has threatened him with a clenched fist several times. Although more sophisticated and educated compared to Eddie, Bill is also stubborn and is more than capable of using insulting phrases as he occasionally refers to Eddie as a "white honky" and "snowflake", and does not like catching Eddie staring at his wife. He also has a very high-pitched laugh. Bill was promoted to foreman at the end of the episode "Clarky Leaves". His catchphrases include "Hey, honky!", "Cobblers!" and "You talking to me, snowflake?".

Barbie Reynolds (Nina Baden-Semper) is Bill's wife. Barbie and her next-door neighbour, Joan Booth, instantly strike up a friendship that carries on throughout the series, and the two women are often seen drinking tea or eating or getting caught up in their antagonistic husbands' latest row. Eddie is sometimes fascinated by her, as in the pilot episode when she bends over while wearing hot pants. She and Joan both become pregnant at the end of Series 3, with Barbie giving birth to a son, Terry. Unlike other characters, she does not have any catchphrases.

Other main cast members are Jacko Robinson (Keith Marsh) and Arthur Thomas (Tommy Godfrey) who are often seen with Eddie and Bill in their local bar. Jacko's catchphrase "I'll 'ave half", meaning a half of bitter, became a popular catchphrase.

Revealed frog

The revealed frog, orange-thighed tree frog or whirring tree frog ("Litoria revelata") is a frog from Australia. It is related to the brown tree frog. It lives in three different places in Queensland and New South Wales, but scientists think the frogs living in different places might be different species.

The male frog is 26 to 28 mm long from nose to rear end. The female is 30 to 36 mm long.

This frog can live in swamps near the coast up to rainforests in the mountains. Scientists say people can tell whether a frog is a revealed frog by looking at it because it has much larger discs at the ends of its toes than other frogs do and because it sometimes has black spots on its middle. People can tell it apart from other frogs by listening to it because its voice is around 4 Hz. It has long legs and a stripe from its nose to each armpit. It is cream-brown or red-brown in colour. It may have orange on its legs.

Scientists knew this frog existed in at least the 1960s, but it was first formally described, meaning scientists wrote the first formal paper about it, in 1982.

It lays its eggs in still water.

This frog is not endangered but people do damage its habitat by removing trees and bringing cows there to eat the grass.

M1 carbine

The M1 carbine is a short, lightweight semi-automatic rifle, or a carbine, used in the United States military from World War II until late in the Vietnam War. It was made to arm soldiers with less of a combat role and more of a support role, such as medics and radiomen. The kind of weapon the military wanted was a gun that would be more powerful and accurate than the M1911, but shorter and lighter than the M1 Garand. The M1 Garand was too long and heavy for support troops to carry, especially since combat was not their main job.

Even though the M1 carbine looks similar to the M1 Garand, the two guns are actually very different. First, the M1 carbines bullets, the .30 Carbine, are much smaller and lighter than the Garand's .30-06 bullets. Second, the gun itself is much lighter, smaller, and shorter range than the Garand. The M1 carbine weighs less than half of the Garand. Third, the M1 carbine is loaded with box magazines that holds 15 bullets, while the M1 Garand is loaded with clips that hold 8 bullets.

Even though it is not used by the military anymore, it is still popular with civilians.

The M2 carbine is a selective fire version of the M1, which means it can switch between semi-automatic and full automatic fire.

Iriomote cat

The Iriomote cat ("Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis") is a wildcat that lives only on Iriomote Island in Japan. It is a subspecies of the leopard cat ("Prionailurus bengalensis"). In Japanese, people call it "yamaneko", or "mountain cat."

This cat is a little larger than a domestic cat, with rounder ears and spots where a tabby cat would have stripes.

These cats live in forests and on hills with streams. They have been seen on beaches. They can climb trees and swim. There are almost no small mammals on Iriomote Island, so the cats cannot eat mice or other rodents the way wildcats in other places do. They eat many different kinds of things, for example insects, lizards, fish, and shrimp.

The females give birth to 1-4 kittens at a time in dens in trees or in crevices in rocks. People have seen kittens as young as three months living on their own. Scientists think it takes 10-12 months for them to become adults.

Ecologist Masako Izawa of the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa said she thinks there are fewer than 1000 Iromote cats in the wild. There may be only 100. This cat is endangered because of habitat loss, meaning that human beings build things in the places where they live. Some cats are hit by cars when they come to the road to eat dead frogs, dead lizards, and other animals that have been killed by cars. They are also endangered because domestic cats mate with them. Veterinarians have taught people on Iriomote Island to spay and neuter their pet cats to prevent this, the local government has tried to stop people from driving too fast and the government of Japan has made part of Iriomote Island a wildlife protection area.

For a time in the 1970s, the people who lived on Iriomote Island said the government of Japan thought the cats were more important than they were. One German scientist had asked the government of Japan to make all the human beings leave the island to protect the cat. Other scientists showed, however, that the cat can live next to humans and is not afraid to look for food near farms and rice paddies. In 2019, many Iriomote islanders said they were proud of their rare wildcat, though they worried that too many tourists would come to their island and damage it.

The courts of the United States have used the discovery doctrine to say that Native Americans were not allowed to own land. The reasoning behind this thinking is that they were just occupants of the land and did not really own it before Europeans came. Therefore, the land was not theirs but belongs to European governments or their successors (in this case, the United States and Americans would be the land owner since the country was formed after independence from Great Britain).

Many people now think that the discovery doctrine is not fair and racist. They think indigenous peoples should have the right to own land because the land is part of who they are as a people group and owning land allows them to have more legal benefits.

Some churches that have supported the discovery doctrine in the past now repudiate it. That means that they do not believe anymore and that they are sorry for all the hurt it has caused. Many of the churches that repudiated the discovery doctrine are Protestant churches in North America, specifically the United States. 

The Catholic Church has not made a statement against the discovery doctrine. Many of the rulers who used the doctrine discovery were Catholics.

The Catholic Church officially repudiated the Doctrine of Discovery in March of 2023.

Between early-2011 and June 30, 2012, the Obama campaign and supporters spent about $400 million, according to the Federal Election Commission.

Dukakis won 10 states and the District of Columbia, receiving a total of 111 electoral votes compared to Bush's 426 (Dukakis would have received 112, but one faithless elector who was pledged to him voted for Bentsen for president and Dukakis for vice president instead out of protest). Dukakis received 46% of the popular vote to Bush's 54%.

Many commentators blamed Dukakis' loss on the embarrassing photograph of him in a tank taken on September 13, 1988. Much of the blame was also laid on Dukakis' campaign, which was criticized for being poorly managed despite being well funded.

Lamborghini Espada

The Lamborghini Espada is a station wagon made by Lamborghini. It was made from 1968 to 1978. There were three generations of the Espada. These generations were known as Series I, Series II, and Series III.

The Lamborghini Espada was designed by Marcello Gandini in 1967.

The Espada is a four-seater grand-touring car. It was initially sold at the same time as the Islero and the mid-engine Miura. The Espada and the Islero both replaced the 400 GT.

Three different series of the Espada were made. These were the S1 (1968–1970), the S2 (1970–1972) and the S3 (1972–1978). Each series was an update from the last, with changes such as more horsepower and a redesigned interior. Overall, 1,217 Espadas were made.

The Espada was launched at the 1968 Geneva Motor Show, alongside the Islero. The Espada was equipped with a Lamborghini V12 engine, which was based off the one used in the 400 GT 2+2. The engine was rated at in the series I cars. 186 Series I Espadas were made before January 1970.

At the 1970 Brussels Motor Show, Lamborghini revealed the Series II version of the Espada. The power output of the Espada increased to due to a higher 10.7:1 compression ratio. The brakes were changed to vented Girling discs instead of solid discs. CV joints were now used on the rear half-shafts. Lamborghini made 575 of the Series II Espadas, which was the most of any series of Espada.

The Series III Espada was launched in 1972. It was fitted with wider Pirelli Cinturato 215/70WR15 CN12 tyres. The front grille now had a square instead of hexagonal mesh. A sunroof was also made an option for the Series III.

The engine was carried over from the Series II Espada. Power steering by ZF and air conditioning were now standard. In 1974, a Chrysler Torqueflite 3 speed automatic transmission became available as an option.

From 1975, large impact bumpers had to be installed to meet United States safety requirements. Other changes had to be made for the car to meet US laws. Some people consider these later US-spec cars to be a separate fourth series of the Espada.

The Espada used an updated version of the 400 GT’s 4.0 liter V12 engine. The engine produced horsepower in the Series I Espada, and in the Series II and III Espadas. The engine was paired to a five-speed manual transmission, with a three-speed Chrysler-built automatic transmission as an option for the Series III Espada.

Serial comma

The serial comma or Oxford comma is a comma used directly after the second-to-last item in a list of three or more items. For example, a list of three people may be shown as "Alice, Bob, and Charlie" (with the comma) or "Alice, Bob and Charlie" (without the comma).

Some style guides prefer using the comma, while others advise against it. It may sometimes be useful to add the comma to avoid confusion. For example, a sentence such as "Please bring Marcus, a musician and a skater to the dinner event today" may confuse anyone reading that sentence. Without the Oxford comma, they might think that Marcus is a musician and a skater, so they would need to bring Marcus instead of three people to that dinner event today.

When following a style guide that opposes the comma, one can rearrange the terms to avoid confusion. For example, saying "a musician, a skater and Marcus" does not change the intended meaning, but it avoids the confusion.

Burmese alphabet

The Burmese alphabet is an alphabet that is used to write some languages, including the Burmese language. It is also used to write down the religious languages of Sanskrit and Pali. It is very different from the ABCs. It is known for having a lot of round letters that look like circles.

Some people in Burma use the Burmese alphabet to write their own languages, but add extra letters to represent the sounds unique to their own languages.

Burmese is written from left to right.

Monks would write on palm leaves. They had to make the letters round because straight lines would split the leaf and ruin it. Eventually, these round letters became the Burmese alphabet as we know it today.

The Burmese alphabet has 33 basic consonants. Extra marks are added to indicate vowels and tones.

There are 33 consonants in the Burmese alphabet. When they are alone, they have an "ah" sound, although people use the "uh" sound when another syllable follows it.

The Burmese alphabet is not organized the same way as the ABCs. Instead, consonants are organized by the parts of the mouth they are made in. For example, the first row of consonants are all sounds that are made when the tongue is against the back of the mouth.

Some letters are written different in different cases to avoid confusion with other letters. For example, ဝ + ာ is written as ဝါ (wah) to avoid confusion with တ (t).

There are letters that are used in words from Pali. They are: ဃ (gh), ဈ (jh), ဋ (ṭ), ဌ (ṭh), ဍ (ḍ), ဎ (ḍh), ဏ (ṇ), ဓ (dh), and ဠ (ḷ).

Two letters, ၐ ("ś") and ၑ ("ṣ"), are only used in words that are from Sanskrit. They are pronounced the same as သ.

To make more consonants, special marks are written around or below consonants. These marks are: ျ, ြ, ွ, and ှ. They change the consonant sound. For example, ရ makes a y sound (like you) but ရ + ှ makes ရှ which makes a sh sound (like shoe). There are rules about which consonants can be changed this way.

Every letter has a "ah" sound when it's alone. For example, က is pronounced as "kah." When a lone letter is followed by another syllable, it is pronounced with a "uh" sound.

Special marks are written around the letters to show other vowels.

Burmese is a tonal language. That means that the meaning of a word can change by how fast or slow someone let air out of their throats. In written Burmese, tones are indicated by special marks.

These marks are း (high tone) and ့ (creaky tone, but can only be used when an ending consonants is written down too).

Burmese words cannot end in a consonant sound. For example, "cat" would not be a word in Burmese because it has a "t" sound at the end. However, words are written with consonants to indicate special vowel sounds that are allowed at the end of Burmese words. These consonants have a special mark on them (်) called asat. When these consonants are combined with the vowels that are already written, they are called syllable rhymes.

Some of these special consonants indicate that the word needs to end with a puff of air, like in "uh-oh" between the uh and the oh. They are: က်, စ်, တ်, ပ်.

Other special sounds indicate that the vowels is nasal. Nasal vowels are not found in English, but are found in other languages like French and Portuguese. They are: င်, ည် ဉ်, န်, မ်.

In Burmese writing, consonants can be written on top of each other. There are very specific rules on which consonants can be stacked on top of which.

Kongonaphon

Kongonaphon is an early member of the dinosaur–pterosaur clade Ornithodira. It is a small reptile-type fossil found in the 
Middle to Late Triassic of Madagascar. It was probably an insectivore, based on the shape and texture of its teeth.

"Kongonaphon" is notable for its tiny size, even compared to other small early avemetatarsalia. The femur was only about 4 cm (1.6 inches) long, and the total height of the animal was about 10 cm (3.9 inches). 

It has long been thought that early members of the group were small. If they were as small as this, then a miniaturization event occurred near the base of the avian stem lineage. Also the small size explains the origin of body covering ("integument", hair on the body of dinosaurs and feathers on birds). Tiny creatures are most vulnerable to changes in external temperature.

Knuckle-walk

Knuckle-walking is a way some land animals move. Knuckle-walking animals curl fingers or front toes like a fist and touch the ground using the bony part of the front foot, the knuckle. Gorillas, chimpanzees, anteaters and platypuses knuckle-walk. In general, animals knuckle walk if their hands or front paws have special shapes for doing something very different from walking. Apes use their hands to hold food and use tools, so they have fingers. They curl up their fingers when they knuckle-walk. Anteaters use their front paws to dig for ants, so they curl up their digging claws when they knuckle-walk. Platypuses use their front paws to swim, so they curl up their webbed toes when they knuckle-walk.

Large anteaters that walk on the ground, for example the giant anteater, knuckle-walk. Smaller anteaters that live in trees do not. Platypuses walk on their knuckles so that the webbing on their front feet will not get in the way.

Gorillas from the genus "Gorilla" and chimpanzees from the genus "Pan" both walk on their knuckles but not in the same way. Chimpanzees spend more time in trees than gorillas do, so they turn their wrists in many different ways. Gorillas usually keep their wrists straight when they knuckle-walk. Gorillas and chimpanzees knuckle-walk when they move on the ground because their bodies are adapted to move around in trees: their arms are longer than their legs, and their middles are cone-shaped. The bones in their arms are good for knuckle-walking: the radius can lock into one of the bones in the wrist so the two bones together can hold the animal's weight. Human arm and wrist bones do not do this.

Some fictional cavemen knuckle-walk or drag the knuckles of their long arms on the ground, but scientists do not agree on whether human beings evolved from ancestors who really knuckle-walked on the ground the way gorillas do. One team of scientists said humans evolved from a tree-living ancestor, like chimpanzees did, because of the way our wrist bones are. Another team of scientists wrote that "Australopithecus anamensis" and "Australopithecus afarensis", extinct relatives of humans, probably knuckle-walked.

The name is taken from the two most important islands in the reserve. Saluja Island, which means (waterfall) in Nubian language, while the name Ghazal Island seems to refer to one of the ancient plants that were growing on these islands.

The region declared a nature reserve by decision of the Prime Minister of Egypt in 1986. With the aim of preserving the biological diversity of endangered animals, plants and mammals.

The reserve contains a variety of living creatures from the animal and plant kingdoms despite the small size of the reserve and its presence in the middle of the Nile. Among the most famous animals in the reserve are camels, goats, wild donkeys, hyenas, and the red fox (the Egyptian fox) which, although it does not live mainly in the islands of the reserve but lives in the West Bank of the Nile and crosses the river by swimming to build a hole on the islands of the reserve. Sixty species of resident and migratory birds live in the reserve as well, some of which are threatened with extinction. The most famous of these rare birds is the black ibis, which became the symbol of the reserve. The plant life in the reserve is more varied and clear, as there are more than 90 different types of plants. The reserve is characterized by stunning landscapes that combine the often quiet vegetation with the water surface of the Nile, which made it an important tourist attraction.

Joseph James DeAngelo

Joseph James DeAngelo Jr. (born November 8, 1945) is an American serial killer, serial rapist, burglar, and former police officer. He murdered about thirteen people, raped 50 women, and did over 100 burglaries in California between 1974 and 1986.

He was responsible for at least three crime sprees throughout California. 

DeAngelo killed many people in southern California, where he was known as the Night Stalker and later the Original Night Stalker (because serial killer Richard Ramirez had also been called the "Night Stalker"). He is believed to have threatened both victims and police.

During the decades-long investigation, several suspects were cleared through DNA evidence, alibi, or other investigative methods. 

In 2001, after DNA testing indicated that the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker were the same person, the name EARONS started to be used. He was nicknamed Golden State Killer in early 2013 to raise awareness that he was not caught. 

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and local law-enforcement agencies held a news conference on June 15, 2016, to announce a renewed nationwide effort. On April 24, 2018, authorities charged 72-year-old DeAngelo with eight counts of first-degree murder, based upon DNA evidence; investigators had identified members of DeAngelo's family through forensic genetic genealogy. 

DeAngelo cannot be charged with 1970s rapes, but he was charged in August 2018 with 13 related kidnapping and kidnapping attempts. On June 29, 2020, DeAngelo pled guilty to multiple counts of murder and kidnapping. 

As part of the plea bargain, DeAngelo was also required to admit to many crimes he had not been formally charged with, including rapes.

Litoria viranula

Litoria viranula is a frog from Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. It is related to "Litoria bicolor".

The male adult frog is about 23.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the females is about 26.4 mm long. Its head is longer than it is wide and its pupils open up and down. The front feet usually have almost no webbing and the back feet have lots of webbing. It is bright green with a bronze stripe on its back. It has darker patches on its legs and middle.

It lives in forests near the Digul River and Fly River.

They lay eggs in flowing water and in temporarily flooded places.

The Latin name of this species "viranula" is a combination of "viridis" and "ranula" for "green" and "frog".

Ghana Football Association

In October 2019, a new president Kurt Okraku was elected. Mr Mark Addo was elected vice president in November 2019.

In an exclusive interview with TV3, Anas indicated that Mr. Nyantakyi appeared experienced in scamming and rather gave him, Anas, tutorials on how to scam people including the institution Nyantakyi headed.

The embattled GFA boss was caught on camera scheming with the undercover journalist to defraud the Ghana Football Association and to also bribe their way through several contracts to eventually “take over” the country.

One of the scientists who saw the frog, Paul Oliver of the Queensland Museum, said, "It's a big green frog with lots of webbing on its toes. They live high in the forest canopy and if they want to move they will just jump into the air and they spread their fingers and toes, and then they can control their descent."

As of 2019, scientists only saw the parachuting frog once. They found it in the Muller mountain range, 515 meters above sea level. The scientists used DNA barcoding to examine the parachuting frog and its relatives, the Pinocchio frog and montane Pinocchio frog.

It has a hunger for human flesh that can not be satisfied.

The word Wendigo can be spelled in many ways.

The creature is called Wìdjigò in the Algonquin language and wīhtikōw in the Cree language.

Many Wendigo are called Windigoag.

The wendigo is said to be ugly. It also likes to eat human flesh.

People who are possessed by wendigo spirits can become cannibals. That means they kill and eat other people.

Saying the word Wendigo is believed to make it appear, so people do not say it aloud or they censor it so that the full word is not written out (like wend*go)

The word wendigo is also used to describe greedy people who are never satisfied with what they have and just consume more and more. Therefore, it has been used to describe European colonization and its effects on Native people and the land.

Rest in power

Rest in power is a saying that is used to replace "rest in peace," which is said after someone dies. The phrase "rest in power" is used for people who have dedicated their lives to activism or those who have died due to oppression, such as racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. Using the term "rest in power" instead of "rest in peace" sends a message that the dead person cannot rest in peace until change occurs. "Rest in power" also means that the dead person is making changes in society despite being dead.

The phrase "rest in power" is used in progressive groups.

"Rest in power" is a newer phrase. An early example of the phrase was published in an LA Weekly article about Latino gangs in East L.A. in 1989. 

Another use appeared in 2000 in honor of a graffiti artist in Oakland, California who was shot and killed.

By the mid-2000s, the phrase began to appear in print, again linked to young people's premature, violent deaths. In March 2003, under the headline "Rest In Power, Rachel Corrie", "In These Times" eulogised the death of activist Rachel Corrie at the hands of the Israeli military in Gaza. In a 2005 opinion piece in the "San Francisco Chronicle", Meredith Maran reflected on 19-year-old Meleia Willis-Starbuck, a Dartmouth College scholarship student who was home in Berkeley for the summer when she was shot and killed by an unknown assailant outside her apartment. Writing of the makeshift public altar set up to mourn Willis-Starbuck, Maran wrote, "I've never seen 'Rest in Power' written as a substitute for 'Rest in Peace.'"

A September 29, 2005 article in the "Ottawa Citizen", a Canadian newspaper, described a public graffiti memorial for teenage Ottawa murder victim Jennifer Teague that portrayed "a smiling Ms. Teague beneath the words, 'Rest in power'" and framed by "two black angels."

People who are part of Black Lives Matter use "Rest in power" to remember all Black people who died because of racism. Even though the phrase wasn't used yet during the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, people still say "rest in power" when talking about people who died because of racism back then or were involved in the movement. For example, Emmett Till died in 1955, but people still say "rest in power" when they're talking about him.

When Trayvon Martin died, his parents used the phrase to honor him. They wrote a book called "Rest in Power" about his life.

An American trans girl named Leelah Alcorn committed suicide in 2014, citing her inability to continue living with her parents' transphobia. After her death, her parents continued to refuse to recognize or respect her identity, and instead chose to use her deadname instead of her preferred name. People in queer online communities used "rest in power" to honor Leelah and her struggle for recognition and acceptance.

Deadnaming

Deadnaming is using a name (called a "deadname") that a transgender person used before transitioning without their permission. It is called that because the person who that name belongs to is considered "dead" and is now a brand-new person. 

Sometimes, people deadname another person by accident. They may know the other person before they transitioned. Other times, people deadname other people on purpose. Using a person's deadname is considered to be very disrespectful because it ignores a person's gender identity and is a type of transphobia if it happens on purpose. Some people think that deadnaming is a form of violence.

It is very hard for people to change their names on forms because there is a lot of paperwork involved. That means that they are more likely to experience deadnaming.

Hexokinase

A hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates (adds phosphyryl groups) hexoses (six-carbon sugars). It takes in a substrate (usually glucose in most organisms) and adds a phosphate (usually from ATP) to form hexose phosphate as the product. When the substrate is glucose, the product is glucose-6-phosphate.

Suicide of Leelah Alcorn

Leelah Alcorn was a transgender American girl. On December 28, 2014, she killed herself because her parents did not respect her gender identity. They made her learn lessons at home and forced her to go to conversion therapy in order to force her to accept her birth gender. After Alcorn died, many laws were made in order to stop discrimination against trans people.

Leelah Alcorn was born into a conservative Christian family. They lived in the U.S. state of Ohio.

In the United States, many conservative Christians do not like anything related to LGBT causes. They believe that boys will always be boys and girls will always be girls because they think that God made them that way. They also think that transgender people are "confused" and need to learn how to appreciate their birth gender. One way they do that is through conversion therapy. However, many studies have shown that this type of therapy does not work and hurts the people it is supposed to help.

Ever since she was 4, Alcorn felt like a "girl trapped in a boy's body." When she was 14, she identified as transgender. She told her mom that she was transgender. Her mom said that it was a "phase" and that she could never be a woman. This made her depressed, so her mom sent her to Christian therapists who also told her that she was a man and that she should "look to God for help." When Alcorn was still alive, conversion therapy was still legal in Ohio. Going to these therapists did not make her feel better.

When Alcorn was 16, she told other kids at school that she liked boys. Other kids at school accepted that she liked boys and were happy for her. However, her parents were not happy. They thought she was making the family name look bad. They made her go to an online school that taught Christian values. They did not allow her to use social media or a cell phone. Because of these rules, Alcorn felt very alone.

Before she died, Alcorn wrote a post on Tumblr. It said:

Alcorn asked for her belongings to be sold so that the money could go to support groups that work for trans rights. She signed the note as "(Leelah) Alcorn." "Josh" was the name her parents gave her at birth.

She also wrote another note and left it in her bedroom. It said, "I've had enough." Her parents threw it away after the police made a copy.

Alcorn walked onto a highway near her house and was hit by a truck.

The note got a lot of attention on Tumblr. However, her Tumblr blog disappeared after her parents asked Tumblr to delete it.

Alcorn's family had a private funeral. Her body was said to have been cremated.

In 2015, the Ohio State Patrol said that Alcorn's death was a suicide.

Many people were sad that Leelah Alcorn died and that she was treated badly by her parents. They thought that she was a victim of her parent's transphobia.

Alcorn's parents were sad that she died. However, they refused to recognize her as transgender. In a Facebook post, Alcorn's mother Carla called her by her deadname, A lot of people thought that was disrespectful because "Josh" was not the name Alcorn wanted to be called. Some people sent mean messages to her mom on Facebook. Others said that her parents should go to jail and lose custody of their other kids. Carla Alcorn deleted the post.

Carla Alcorn went onto CNN and said that "we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy." Some people said that their love was not "unconditional" because of their hostile reaction to Leelah when she told them she was trans.

Many people around the world talked about Alcorn's death. They made art and lit candles to honor her.

Many LGBT rights groups said that transgender suicide happened a lot because trans people are being treated badly, just like how Leelah was treated wrong. Besides the problem of suicide, trans people are often killed and treated wrong in other ways.

Some people tried to raise money to buy a gravestone with the name Leelah Alcorn on it to replace the gravestone with her birth name on it. However, this did not happen. Instead, a group bought a bench, tree, and plaque.

A petition was made to ban conversion therapy in the United States. President Barack Obama said that he supported laws banning conversion therapy. 

In December of 2015, Cincinnati banned conversion therapy. As of July 2020, five cities in Ohio have banned conversion therapy and two others had banned it on minors.

Eat the Rich

Eat the Rich is a phrase. Attributed to French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau The direct phrase in his original language is: ""Quand les pauvres n'auront plus rien à manger, ils mangeront les riches!"" (When the poor have nothing more to eat, they will eat the rich!).

This saying is used by people who are anti-capitalist to show their disapproval of Capitalism whos wealth is built on the exploitation of the people - literally to starvation. It is a warning to the rich who would build their wealth at the expense of everyone else, as the poor will unite in arms to take their heads ("eat" here not being used literally to mean cannibalism). Today it is a battlecry or slogan to rally the working class against those that would exploit them. This phrase was used more at the beginning of the 21st century because of increasing income inequality.

The phrase Eat the Rich is used in pop culture. It expresses rebellion against the wealthy and powerful.

Skin-walker

A skin-walker (Navajo: yee naaldlooshii) is a fictional shape shifting creature that usually takes the form of a wolf or coyote. It is said that in order to become one you must kill a close friend or a family member.

The concept of the skin-walker is unique to the Navajo people. In their language, the word "yee naaldlooshii" means, "with it [the animal skin], he goes on all fours."

A skin-walker may be a man or a woman. Skin-walkers are usually associated with trickster animals like the coyote or with animals that represent death and bad luck. They can turn into any animal they want by wearing its skin. Because of this, the Navajo will not wear the skin of a predator animal. Also, skin-walkers are really fast. People can be possessed by a skin-walker by looking them in the eye.

A skin-walker knows about the same rituals and spells like other Navajo medicine men. Unlike medicine men, they use their knowledge to do evil. A person becomes a skin-walker by killing someone in their family, which is a really evil thing to do according to the Navajo.

The Navajo agree that skin-walkers are hard to kill. According to them, the best way to kill a skin-walker is to get a shaman who knows about good magic to do certain spells and rituals that can return a skin-walker's evil back to them. Others think that skin-walkers can be killed by bullets dipped in white ash. However, these bullets won't work unless they hit the skin-walker in the head or neck.

The skin-walker represents everything evil in the Navajo culture. To them, there is nothing good about the skin-walker. People who are skin-walkers use black magic to kill others.

They really do not like talking about skin-walkers, especially to people who are not Navajo. Some even do not want to say the word and will take great pains to hide it, such as by typing sk*nw*lker. They believe that saying its name or mentioning it will make it appear.

The Navajo tell stories about the skin-walker in order to teach their children about right and wrong. They believe that children who learn how to do the right thing and lead moral lives are less likely to become evil, which is what the skin-walker is.

When non-Native people talk about the skin-walker, they usually use it in horror movies and stories. But when Native people tell horror stories, they use another scary character to replace the skin-walker.

Big Five

Big Five is the name colloquially given to the five largest banks that dominate the banking industry of Canada. All five banks are operationally based in Toronto. All five banks are classified as Schedule I banks that are domestic banks operating in Canada under government charter. The banks' shares are widely held, with any entity allowed to hold a maximum of twenty percent.

The Big Five are among the world's strongest banks, with Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal & Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at 11th, 15th, 21st, 28th & 29th place, respectively.

In modern history, Royal Bank has always been the largest by a significant margin, although TD Bank has overtaken RBC in recent years. Up to the late 1990s, CIBC was the second largest, followed by Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, and TD Bank. During the late 1990s and beyond, this ranking changed due to several reorganizations. Royal Bank acquired Royal Trust in 1993, while Scotiabank purchased National Trust in 1997. As Scotiabank found no merger partners among the other banks in the big five group, it instead expanded its international operations and passed the Bank of Montreal in size. TD Bank merged with Canada Trust, which was for a long time the largest trust in Canada, thus vaulting TD into the number one spot. There has been no major changes to Bank of Montreal. CIBC's first unsuccessful foray into the US market led it to shed its assets there, dropping it to the number five spot.

Four Pillars

The four pillars policy is an Australian government policy to maintain the separation of the four largest banks in Australia by rejecting any merger or acquisition between the four major banks.

The policy, originally "six pillars" (it initially included AMP and National Mutual), was adopted in 1990 by then Labor Treasurer Paul Keating. It covered the big four banks (Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, NAB, ANZ) and two insurers (AMP and National Mutual). It was essentially designed to block the merger between ANZ and National Mutual at the time. Keating believed this arrangement would ensure a competitive banking market.

In 1997, leading business figure Stan Wallis (Businessweek bio) produced a report of his inquiry into Australia's financial system (the Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry, commonly referred to as "the Wallis report.") which recommended that the "Four Pillars" model be dismantled, to leave the banks subject to the same merger competition tests as other businesses. In response, then Coalition Treasurer Peter Costello's removed the pillar status of the two insurers (National Mutual had by that time already been acquired by France's AXA), but the ban on mergers of the remaining four banks was retained, with the rider that none of them were considered immune from foreign takeover. With the change of government, new Treasurer Wayne Swan has stated in 2008, that the Labor government has no plans to dismantle the four pillars policy.

The four pillars policy does not prevent the four major banks from acquiring smaller competitors. For example, in 2000, CBA acquired the Colonial group, which had emerged as a major bank–insurance combine in the 1990s, after the Colonial Mutual insurance group took over State Bank of NSW in 1994. The Commonwealth Bank also acquired the State Bank of Victoria in 1990 and BankWest in 2008. Westpac acquired the Challenge Bank in 1995, the Bank of Melbourne in 1997, and St.George Bank in 2008.

The policy has been criticised for being anti-competitive by ensuring that the four major banks are immune from takeover by the most likely suitors. At the same time, it is credited with insulating the banks from the global financial crisis of 2007–08. The major banks have criticised the policy on the basis that limiting the size of Australian banks makes them less internationally competitive.

Jargon File

The Jargon File is a glossary and usage dictionary of slang used by computer programmers. The original Jargon File was a collection of terms from technical cultures such as the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI Lab (SAIL) and others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities. It included Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Carnegie Mellon University, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. It was published in paperback form in 1983 as The Hacker's Dictionary (edited by Guy Steele), revised in 1991 as The New Hacker's Dictionary (ed. Eric S. Raymond; third edition published 1996).

The concept of the file began with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) that came out of early PDP-1 and TX-0 hackers in the 1950s, where the term hacker emerged and the ethic, philosophies and some of the nomenclature emerged.

Crimean Tatar language

The Crimean Tatar language (which is often simply called Crimean) is spoken by Crimean Tatars who live mostly in the Crimean peninsula. It is one of the Kipchak languages, (which are also called Northwestern Turkic languages), and is unrelated to the Tatar language: Speakers of one language cannot understand people who speak the other. There are about 500,000 native speakers of Crimean. About half of them live on the Crimean peninsula, about 200,000 in Uzbekistan, about 30,000 in Russia, 2,500 in Romania and 600 in Bulgaria.

Nyctimystes

Nyctimystes is a genus of tree frogs in the family Pelodryadidae. Most of them are from Papua New Guinea but some live on the Moluccas islands. Some scientists think "Nyctimystes" should be considered part of "Litoria", another genus of frogs from New Guinea. Other scientists think that it is right to say "Nyctimystes" is its own genus.

All frogs in "Nyctimystes" have marks on their lower eyelids: lines, veins, or dots. Scientists think this helps the frog harder to see so it can hide from larger animals that want to eat it. Scientists tell "Nyctimystes" frogs apart from "Litoria" frogs because "Nyctimystes" frogs have vertical (up and down) pupils in their eyes and "Litoria" frogs have horizontal (side to side) pupils in their eyes.

These frogs live in tropical or subtropical rainforests on mountains. Their eggs are large and scientists have seen many of them laying eggs on underwater objects in fast-flowing creeks and streams, enough that they think all "Nyctimystes" frogs do this. The tadpoles have large sucker-mouths and streamlined bodies with large, muscular tails. All "Nyctimystes frogs" have webbed feet and large discs on their toes for climbing.

Scientists say most "Nyctimystes" frogs became separate species during the Miocene era, about 10 to 22 million years ago.

The name comes from the Greek "nycktos" for "night" and "myst" meaning "mist." Together they refer to "mysteries of the night."

Many of these frogs are few in number in the wild, and scientists do not know much about most of them. Scientists often write papers saying a frog species should be renamed and moved from "Nyctimystes" into "Litoria" or "Ranoidea", so the list below may change:

It is about 1.5 miles from Manchester city centre. It plays in the Women's Super League (WSL). This is the highest level of English women's football. United were promoted from the Championship at the end of the 2018–19 season. They train at Leigh Sports Village. However, the team will move to The Cliff when redevelopment work is done.

A team called Manchester United Supporters Club Ladies started playing in the late 1970s. It was unofficially known as the club's first women's team. They helped start the North West Women's Regional Football League in 1989. The team played better and better in the 90s at different levels of the FA Women's National League, until 2001.

In 2001, the team started an official partnership with Manchester United. However, the club finished mid-table in the third division for a few years. The team stopped playing four years later, in 2005. This was soon after Malcolm Glazer's bought the club. He did not believe the women's team was going to make him any money. A media spokesman for Manchester United also said that the club wanted to focus on its women's academy instead of its senior team.

In March 2018, Manchester United announced they wanted to start a new women's football team. Manchester United Women Football Club started again on 28 May 2018. This was after the team asked to join the new 2018–19 FA Women's Championship. This was thirteen years after the club stopped playing in 2005. The club's academy had continued through the Manchester United Foundation. For example, Izzy Christiansen and Katie Zelem went through United's Centre of Excellence academy. Casey Stoney was the club's first head coach. She became coach on 8 June. They announced the first 21-player team about a month later.

The team's first game back was on 19 August 2018. They won 1–0 in an away game against Liverpool in the FA Women's League Cup. Lizzie Arnot scored their first competitive goal in thirteen years. Three weeks later, they played their first Championship match. They won 12–0 against Aston Villa. On 17 April 2019, United won promotion to the FA Women's Super League after a 5–0 win against the same team. They won the FA Women's Championship title three days later.

The 2019–20 season was the team's first FA WSL campaign. The season's first game was a Manchester derby. It was at the City of Manchester stadium. Manchester City won the match 1–0 in front of a league record attendance of 31,213. United's first division campaign ended early because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The team ended in fourth place on a points per game basis. They won their last game 3–2 against Everton on 23 February 2020. Leah Galton scored twice and Ella Toone scoring once for Manchester United. This was the first game at Everton's new Walton Hall Park stadium. In the FA Cup, Manchester United lost 3–2 to Manchester City in the fourth round. This was the first time they had lost in the first knockout round of a competition. However, they got to the semi-finals in the League Cup for the second time. They lost 1–0 to Chelsea. Chelsea also won in the final.

When the club joined in the 2018–19 FA Women's Championship, they announced they would be located in Broughton, Salford at The Cliff training ground, when it was ready. Until then, United will play their games at Leigh Sports Village. Moss Lane is the venue when the Sports Village is not available. The club also sometimes play at Ewen Fields. United played an FA Cup fifth round match there against London Bees in February 2019.

Manchester United had a girls academy up to under 16's level even when the senior team did not play between 2005 and 2018. This was because of FA rules. The club's partner charity is The Manchester United Foundation. Its work includes coaching girls at all ages across Greater Manchester. Before the 2019–20 season, Manchester United started a full-time U21 team. It played in the FA WSL Academy League for the first time. Charlotte Healy is the manager.

School discipline

When a student or group of students show behaviour that disrupts the current activity, or that goes against rules of the school, a teacher or the school can take action. This action is usually called school discipline. Discipline can guide the children's behaviour or set limits to help them learn to take better care of themselves, other people and the world around them.

Every school has a set of rules and if students break these rules they are subject to discipline. For example, these rules may say that pupils (students) need to wear a school uniform, and what the school uniform must look like. They usually also say that school starts at a given time, and that pupils must be present at the school, at that time. If pupils do not follow the rules, they will be punished. The term "discipline" is applied to the punishment that is the consequence of breaking the rules. The aim of discipline is to set limits restricting certain behaviors or attitudes that are seen as harmful or against the school policies, educational norms, school traditions, etc. In the early days of schools, it was common to punish people if they did not follow the rules set by the school. In more recent times, other approaches have also been tried, such as rewarding good behavior. 

It is important to create an environment, where it is safe and fun for children to learn. Many people confuse discipline with classroom management; discipline is one dimension of classroom management and classroom management is a general term. Discipline can also have a positive effect on both the individual as well as classroom environment. The right form of punishment can give the pupil a chance to reflect and learn about consequences. It can also give collective values, and encourage behavior that is acceptable for the classroom. Recognition of the diversity of values within communities can increase understanding and tolerance of different disciplinary techniques.

Coproal punishment was the most common means of maintaining discipline. When a child was at school, the teacher acted as a substitue parent. Many forms of punishment and rewards were open to the teacher. Hitting children with a cane or a stick was a common punishment if the child did something wrong. 

Corporal punishment in schools has now disappeared from most Western countries, including all European countries. In the United States, corporal punishment is not used in public schools in 34 states, banned in 31, permitted in 19, of which only 16 actually have school districts actively administering corporal punishment. Every U.S. state except New Jersey and Iowa permits corporal punishment in private schools. Many private schools have abandoned the practice, though, especially Catholic schools, nearly all of which now ban. Thirty-one U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia have banned it from public schools, most recently New Mexico in 2011. The other 19 states (mostly in the South) still allow corporal punishment in public schools. Of the 19 which permit the practice, three – Arizona, Colorado, and Wyoming have no public schools that actually use corporal punishment as of 2016. Paddling is still used to a significant (though declining) degree in some public schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Private schools in these and most other states may also use it, though many choose not to do so.

Official corporal punishment, often by caning, remains commonplace in schools in some Asian, African and Caribbean countries.

Most mainstream schools in most other countries still have punishment for misbehavior, but it usually takes non-corporal forms such as detention and suspension.

In China, school corporal punishment was completely banned under the Article 29 of the Compulsory Education Act of the People's Republic of China, but in practice, beating by schoolteachers is still common, especially in rural areas.

In Australia, school corporal punishment has been banned in public schools in all states, but as of 2019, it is still permitted in private schools in Queensland and the Northern Territory.

Detention is one of the most common punishments in schools. A pupil needs to report to a designated area of the school, at a specified time. The pupil will then have to stay at that area, for a given time.

Failure to attend detention without a valid excuse can sometimes result in another longer detention, or a more severe punishment

Counseling is also provided when students will have to see a school counselor (guidance counselor) for misbehavior. The purpose of counseling is to help the student recognize their mistakes and find ways to avoid them. Counseling can also help the student clarify the school's expectations, as well as understand the consequences of failing to meet those standards.

Suspension means that a student must not attend classes, for a given time. In some cases, the student must still come to school, but will not see classmates or teachers during that day. Students who have been suspended are also not allowed to attend out-of-school events (such as sporting events, or proms). 

Usually, schools are required to tell the student's parents why the student was suspended. 

Suspension usually means that students still need to do homework, assignments and exams.

Expulsion is the most severe form of punishment. It terminates the student's education at the given school. This is the last resort, when all other methods of discipline have failed. However, in extreme situations, it may also be used for a single offense, such as setting fires on campus, the activation of false alarms,or assault and battery against faculty and staff members,or school administrators. In some cases, there are special schools for the pupuls that have been excluded from other schools. 

Usually, the parents can appeal against the decision to expel a student.



Palm syrup

Palm syrup is made from the sap of a number of edible palms. It is common on the Canary Islands, and on the coasts of South America. It is often called Miel de palma, which translates to palm honey.

Miel de palma is used to accompany many pastries and desserts, such as pancakes and ice cream. The syrup is widely used in Southeast Asian cooking, in particular in West Bengal, where jhola gur, as it is known, is only obtainable in winter. Its sweetness tempers the flavours of spicy curries, adding its rich, molasses-like flavour to the food. It is also widely used as an ingredient in desserts, or drizzled over prepared foods.

Palm sap is a refreshing drink, and fermented palm syrup is distilled to produce various alcohols such as arrack, a spirit similar to rum. On La Gomera it is mixed with 'Parra' (similar to grappa) to produce Gomeron.

Palm syrup is also traditionally used on La Gomera for general medicinal purposes.

Faithful Word Baptist Church

Faithful Word Baptist is a fundamentalist Independent Baptist church. It is located in Tempe, Arizona and was started by a man named Steven L. Anderson.

The church has received a lot of negative attention. In 2009, Anderson said that he was praying for Barack Obama to die. Obama was the president of the United States back then. It is also homophobic and anti-Semitic. As a result of his beliefs, Anderson has been banned from many countries.

Faithful Word Baptist Church only uses the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. They believe all other Bible versions have errors in them and that the people who wrote them put in their own thoughts and ideas rather than what God wanted.

The church also believes that:

Faithful Word Baptist Church is against abortion and all forms of birth control. They believe that babies should be made naturally because processes like IVF result in a lot of embryos being thrown away. As of July 2020, Steven Anderson has 11 kids.

The church teaches that gay people are going to hell and there is nothing that they can do about it because they belong to a group of people called "reprobates." According to the church, reprobates can never be saved because they rejected Jesus too many times so God allowed them to become reprobates.

The church was started in 2005.

In August of 2009, Anderson gave a sermon called "Why I Hate Barack Obama." In it, he said that he hated Obama for supporting abortion rights and that he prayed for Obama to die.

The day after the sermon, a member of Faithful Word Baptist Church brought weapons to an event Obama was at. He did it as part of a stunt.

Anderson calls gay people "sodomites," which is a really offensive and outdated term for gays. He says that they "recruit" children through rape. He also said that killing gay people would get rid of AIDS and that he prayed for Caitlyn Jenner's heart to explode. Because of these comments, the church has been listed as a hate group by civil rights organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center.

In 2016, 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Anderson called the dead people "pedophiles" and said they were all in hell.

Anderson says that the Holocaust never happened and made a video about it.

Canadian Indian residential school system

Until 1996, Indigenous children in Canada were forced to go to boarding schools in order to make them assimilate into white Canadian society. The Indian residential school system refers to the group of these schools for First Nations children. These schools were run by Christian churches and got money from the Canadian government. These schools existed for over 100 years and more than 150,000 children were in them. Of these children, at least 3,200 died.

Many residential schools were started when the Indian Act was passed in 1876. In 1896, a change was made to the Act so that all First Nations children had to go to school. A lot of their communities were located far away from schools, so they had to go to residential schools and live there for the school year. These schools were usually very far away from their families in order to encourage them to assimilate. There were residential schools in every province and territory except for New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

At these schools, these children were forced to give up their cultures. They were given new names and were not allowed to speak their mother tongues or visit their families. They were abused at these schools and were not treated well. When these children graduated from these schools, they did not fit into their Indigenous communities or into mainstream Canadian society. They did not learn the skills needed to survive off the land. At the same time, these schools did not teach them how to skills on how to live in cities or stop the students from becoming victims of racism. Studies have shown that these students and their children and grandchildren are more likely to have problems such as PTSD, alcoholism, drug use, and suicide than kids who did not go to residential schools.

In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized to the survivors of the residential schools on behalf of the Canadian government. The government also set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in order to learn the truth about what happened at these schools. Many survivors came and talked about their experiences. In 2015, the TRC published a report that said the residential school system was cultural genocide.

Ever since Europeans arrived in North America, they have been trying to teach the native peoples there about European ways. The discovery doctrine that Europeans believed said that it was OK to colonize the land because the people they found were not Christian and were "uncivilized." They thought it was their duty to teach others about Christianity and civilization.

French missionaries started schools for Indigenous people in the 17th century. However, they stopped because making Indigenous people unhappy was not good for the fur trade.

In the 1820s, English missionaries started schools in what is now Manitoba and Ontario. Unlike the French schools, they taught Protestantism.

The Canadian government became interested in starting schools for Indigenous people because they were no longer allies in war. Instead, they were seen as nuisances because many of them moved around as nomads and didn't practice agriculture. The Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) partnered up with the churches to start putting more Indigenous children into the residential schools and "kill the Indian in the child" by converting them to Christianity and bringing them into European-Canadian society. The government provided the buildings and money while the church provided the teachers and staff.

Of the schools run by churches, most of them were run by the Catholic Church. Other schools were run by the Anglican Church, the United Church of Canada, and the Presbyterian Church.

The students at the schools were treated bad by the teachers and staff. They were beaten up and sexually abused. The teachers believed that beating up the students helped to save their souls and stop them from running away. It was bad for a school if students ran away because they were responsible if a student died while running away. Students were malnourished. The schools were crowded, dirty, cold, and didn't have good medical care. That meant that a lot of students ended up getting tuberculosis.

In the residential schools, students learned the same way that European kids were taught. This was very different from how First Nations people taught their kids. The Indigenous people used a "look, listen, learn" method of education that did not involve classrooms or books. Instead, they taught their kids through games, stories, and ceremonies. The kids struggled with book-learning because that was not how their parents taught them. They were also forced to speak English and French. Sometimes, they were beaten up if they spoke in their native languages.

The residential schools didn't meet their goal in extinguishing Indigenous cultures. In some cases, students burned down the schools.

A lot of students died at the schools from disease.

Many Indigenous communities began to take over the schools. They thought that the schools were not doing a good job in teaching their kids.

Some schools became normal day schools, and some schools were burned down or torn down by former students. And still others are now abandoned.

The residential school survivors lost a lot of their culture. They felt powerless. To cope with their feelings, they hurt themselves and others around them.

Many of the survivors now have mental health problems because of their experiences at the schools.

In 1986, the United Church of Canada said sorry for its part in colonization. In 1996, it apologized for running residential schools.

In 1993, the Anglican Church apologized. The next year, the Presbyterian Church apologized too.

In 2004, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) apologized for forcing children into the schools.

In 2009, Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized to the survivors of the residential schools. His apology was broadcast nationwide.

In 2009, the Vatican made a statement that expressed sorrow at how the Church was involved in oppressing Indigenous Canadians. 

In 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked Pope Francis for an apology to the survivors instead of just an expression of sorrow.

During a visit to Canada in July 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Church's role in the Canadian Indian residential school system.

Unconventional warfare

Unconventional warfare is any kind of war that does not fit the traditional war between nations or groups. It includes foreign resistance movements and guerilla groups, who fight against an occupying force or their own government. 

In conventional warfare, the fighters usually wear uniforms, which identifies them as fighters in an army, under the laws of war. With unconventional warfare, this is not the case. Those engaging in unconventional warfare need to hide before they can launch an attack. This means that in most cases they do not wear specific uniforms which identify them as fighters. Struggles of this type are going on at present in parts of Africa.

An unconventional war is rarely announced as a war. No declaration of war is made. Usually, the only feature which is noticed is the presence in a country of organised fighters. The fighters come from a neighbouring country or from parts of the existing country. There are no set rules. 

This kind of warfare has been quite common since 1900. Terrorism is the intimidation of the native civilian population by armed fighters or insurgents, often known as "guerrillas". Warfare inside a state by citizens who wish to overthrow the state, also generally called terrorism by the government, has also been common.

Struggle between regular forces (armies in uniforms) may happen without a formal declaration of war. Red versus white after the end of royal rule in Russia (Russian Civil War) is a good example. It was a semi-formal war, fought with regular troops on both sides. So was the seizing of Manchuria (Manchukuo) by Japan in the early 1930s. Regular Japanese army forces were used.

After World War I and World War II unconventional forces were used to drive out colonial powers or to try and do so. The struggle against colonialism was usually by irregular forces supported by weapons and men from powers interested in removing the colonies (usually Russia or China).

The dividing line between conventional and unconventional warfare is not clear-cut. In general conventional war is fought between regular armies, navies, air forces. Unconventional warfare is usually fought on the ground with at least one side not in uniform, usually against forces of the established government. It is an attempt to overthrow a government or to replace in it some part of the country.


The USA Department of Defense defines unconventional warfare as activities conducted to enable a resistance movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla force in a denied area. Also called UW.

R (programming language)

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistics. R is a language built for a specific purpose. It is strictly designed for statistical analysis. The algorithms for many statistical models are devised in R. Precisely R is the language of Statistical Analyzers. It’s an open source and the best suite for the statisticians to develop statistical softwares. 

The R language was originally made for statistics. But today, it is also used in many scientific fields including ecology.
A list of changes in R releases is maintained in various "news" files at CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Some highlights are listed below for several major releases.

R has local communities worldwide for users to share ideas and learn.

There are a growing number of R events bringing its users together, such as conferences (e.g. useR!, WhyR?, conectaR, SatRdays) and other meetups.
The official annual gathering of R users is called "useR!". The first such event was useR! 2004 in May 2004, Vienna, Austria. After skipping 2005, the useR! conference has been held annually. Subsequent conferences have included:

Future conferences planned are as follows:

"The R Journal" is the open access refereed journal of the R project. It features articles on the use and development of the R language.

Mali War

The Mali War has been ongoing since 2012. The war has three sides. One side is Mali, who are supported by many other countries. Another, many of whom are Tuareg people, are separatists who want northern Mali - which they call Azawad - to become a separate country. Northern Mali is hot desert and is in the southern part of the Sahara. The third side is Islamist groups - including Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al-Qaeda - who want Mali to be part of an Islamist caliphate.

The United Nations has reported many human rights violations, both by the forces close to the government, and by the different rebel groups. Allegedly, there have been amputations, floggings, and extrajudicial executions. A couple was stoned in 2012, for allegedly having an extramarital affair. Based on these reports, the International Criminal Court started investigations into war crimes and human rights abuses. According to the BBC, about 250,000 people have left because of the fighting. They are now refugees and internally displaced people. Another problem is that World Heritage Sites are threatened by the war. There are mosques built of mud, in Timbuktu, which are threatened. In September 2021, a contract was signed between the Malian state and a private Russian military company linked to the Russian military group Wagner. The document provides for the deployment of mercenaries in the country, in liaison with the Malian army, and the protection of senior figures.

The Lord's Resistance Army insurgency is a current guerrilla movement. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency started in 1987. As of 2020, the LRA is somewhat active in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Joseph Kony leads the movement. He says he is "spokesperson" of God and a spirit medium. The movement does not want Yoweri Museveni and his government in Uganda. They want to start a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments and Acholi tradition.

The conflict is one of the longest in Africa. It has started a humanitarian crisis. The International Criminal Court says that the LRA has violated human rights. This includes mutilation, torture, slavery, rape, the abduction (kidnapping) of civilians, the use of child soldiers, and a number of massacres. By 2004, the LRA had abducted more than 20,000 children. 1.5 million civilians had to move. The LRA killed about 100,000 civilians.

In January 1986, the National Resistance Army (NRA) of south-west Uganda born Yoweri Museveni overthrew President Tito Okello, an ethnic Acholi. This started a period of unrest. When they tried to liberate the whole country, the NRA were responsible of many atrocities on the people of Acholi. This made some Acholis want to fight against these acts. Reports sometimes say that the Acholi were afraid to lose their traditional (usual) control of the national military. They were also very worried that the NRA would want retribution for the violent counterinsurgency, especially the actions of the army in the Luwero triangle. By August 1986, a complete popular insurgency had started in northern regions that the new government soldiers occupied.

Chanie Wenjack

Chanie "Charlie" Wenjack (January 19, 1954 – October 23, 1966) was an Ojibwe boy who was famous for running away from a residential school. He died while trying to walk 600 km back home. After Wenjack's death, the Canadian government started to investigate residential schools.

Chanie Wenjack was born at Ogoki Post on the Marten Falls Reserve.

When Wenjack was 9, he and his two sisters were sent to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in Kenora, Ontario. He was known for being funny and for being the first one to understand jokes.

On October 16, 1966, Wenjack ran away from the school with two friends, Ralph and Jackie MacDonald. They stayed with the MacDonalds' uncle, Charley Kelley, at Redditt, which is 31 km from Kenora. Wenjack decided to go back to Ogoki Post by following railroad tracks.

Wenjack walked for 36 hours. He was wearing a windbreaker. The temperature was −6 °C. Bruises on Wenjack's body showed that he fell several times.

A CN railway engineer found Wenjack's body on October 23 at 11:20AM and called the Ontario Provincial Police. The coroner determined the cause of death to be hunger and exposure.

Wenjack was buried at the reserve on October 27, 1966.

The Canadian government started an investigation into Wenjack's death. It concluded the investigation, saying that:

Chanie Wenjack is a symbol of how students at these schools stood up to the abuses and suffering they experienced there. A lecture at Trent University was named after Wenjack after Indigenous students asked for a building to be named in his honor.

In 2016, a video was made about Wenjack's life. His sister Pearl was featured in it. 

The Canadian artist Gord Downie released an album with songs about Wenjack.
