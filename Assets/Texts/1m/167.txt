On March 10, 1993, anti-abortion protesters had been demonstrating in front of Gunn's Pensacola Women's Medical Services clinic. Griffin waited outside, then ambushed Gunn by shooting him three times in the back with a shotgun, shouting "Don't kill any more babies" before opening fire. Griffin did not deny his actions after shooting Gunn and told police "We need an ambulance."

Griffin claimed to be acting on behalf of God. During his trial, Griffin's lead defense attorney, Robert Kerrigan, argued that anti-abortion activist John Burt had brainwashed Griffin and drove him to commit murder. At the time, Burt was the Northwest Florida regional director of the national pro-life group Rescue America. Burt was also a former member of the Ku Klux Klan and self-professed "spiritual adviser" to a group of activists who bombed three abortion clinics in 1984. A jury deliberated three hours before finding Griffin guilty on March 4, 1994.

The murder was one of reasons why in 1994 of the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act was passed. From March 1993 through May 2009, Gunn was the first of a total of four doctors murdered by anti-abortion extremists. Others killed were doctors Barnett Slepian, John Britton and George Tiller. Gunn's murder helped lead to the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Gunn's murder also prompted Paul Jennings Hill to issue the Defensive Action Statement, signed by 30 anti-abortion leaders, which stated their belief that the killing of doctors who perform abortions was justified. Hill went on to murder physician John Britton and Britton's bodyguard in 1994.

Wet nurse

A wet nurse is a woman who breastfeeds and cares for someone elses child. In ancient times this was very common, partly because many women died in childbirth. Many babies died so women were available to do this. Wealthy people would pay women to do this.

Since infant formula was invented this has become much less common.

Verklärte Nacht

Verklärte Nacht (Transfigured Night), Op. 4, is a string sextet in one movement composed by Arnold Schoenberg in 1899. Composed in just three weeks, it is considered his earliest important work. It was inspired by Richard Dehmel's poem of the same name, combined with the influence of Schoenberg's strong feelings upon meeting the sister of his teacher, Alexander von Zemlinsky (1877–1923), whom he married in 1901. The movement can be divided into five distinct sections which refer to the five stanzas of Dehmel's poem;

History of nursing

Nursing in ancient times seems to have developed from wet nursing. Nursing was a job for women, and it still is dominated by women in the 21st century. More than 85% of American nurses are women. Nursing was seen as part of Christianity. Medieval hospitals in Europe were religious communities, with care provided by monks and nuns. 

The Crimean War was important in nursing history. The English nurse Florence Nightingale started professional nursing with the her book "Notes on Nursing". She understood how important hygiene was. Money was collected to support her - £44,039 (worth more than £2 million today). She used it to start the first nurses training school at St Thomas' Hospital. The first nurses trained there used to be called 'Nightingales'. 

Nurses were often expected to live in nurses homes. If they married they lost their job. 

Nurses in psychiatric hospitals were mostly men, because the hospitals had mostly developed from prisons. 

Children's hospital

A children's hospital is a type of hospital. It is generally for people under the age of 18. Some children's hospitals also do maternity and childbirth. 

Before the 19th century there were no children's hospitals as we now know them. Sick children were looked after by their mothers. There were orphanages, and foundling hospitals for children with no mothers. The Foundling Hospital, set up in London in 1739, is one of the most well known. Dispensaries, funded by donations were opened to provide medicine and medical attention to families who could not afford private care. 

Children's hospitals were started in the 19th century. They were mostly quite small. They did not usually care for babies. They were mostly funded by donations. In the 20th century doctors and nurses began to specialize in the care of children. The death rate of children improved. The Hôpital des Enfants Malades was the first in Europe, started in 1801.
Great Ormond Street Hospital was the first in Britain, started in 1852. 

Until the 1970s most children's hospitals restricted adult visitors.

The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life

The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life is a 1956 sociological book by Erving Goffman. In the book, he uses imagery of theatre to show the importance of human social interaction. This became known as Goffman's dramaturgical analysis. It was first published in Scotland in 1956, and the United States in 1959. It was Goffman's first book, and won him the American Sociological Association's MacIver award in 1961. In 1998, the International Sociological Association listed the work as the tenth most important sociological book of the 20th century.

"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life" was the first sociological book to study face-to-face interaction. Goffman uses examples from theatrical performances and shows how they are like everyday conversations. He believed that people would try to change what others thought of them whenever they spoke to somebody else. At the same time, the other person does the same. Another thing that is in the book many times is the idea that making sure everyone in a room has the same definition of the situation is important for interactions.


Thomas theorem

The Thomas theorem is a theory of sociology that was created by William Isaac Thomas and Dorothy Swaine Thomas in 1928. It says:

This means that how a situation is seen will cause the future actions, not the actual truth. In Erving Goffman's 1956 sociological book "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life", he talks a lot about what he calls the definition of the situation, and how it is important that all people see a situation the same. This was based on W. I. Thomas saying, in 1923, that how a person saw situations ("the definition of the situation") would later become part of their personality as they would change how they live their life to be similar to other people.

The Uplift Mofo Party Plan

The Uplift Mofo Party Plan is the third studio album by Red Hot Chili Peppers. Red Hot Chili Peppers is an American rock band. The album was released by Manhattan Records on September 29, 1987. "The Uplift Mofo Party Plan" is the band's only album that has the founding members on every song. These people are singer Anthony Kiedis, bass guitar player Flea, guitar player Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. This is the last Red Hot Chili Peppers album with Slovak on it. This is because he died from a drug overdose in 1988. The album had one single. It is named "Fight Like a Brave". In 1992, "Behind the Sun" was released as a single as well. This was because it was on "What Hits!?", a greatest hits album.

The album was much more successful than the band's first two albums. It was the band's first album to go on the "Billboard" 200 music chart. "The Uplift Mofo Party Plan" was certified gold by the RIAA. The band went on tour to make the album more popular. Slovak died after the tour. Because of this, Irons left the band.

Red Hot Chili Peppers joined EMI in 1983. After the band did this, Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons left the band. They did this so they could focus on their other band, What Is This?. The other members of the Chili Peppers, Anthony Kiedis and Flea, got new members to join. They hired Jack Sherman and Cliff Martinez. The band made an album in 1984 named "The Red Hot Chili Peppers". Kiedis and Flea did not like how the album sounded. They replaced Sherman with Slovak, because Slovak left What Is This? a few weeks earlier. "Freaky Styley" (1985) was the band's first album with Slovak on it. In early 1986, the band started working on their next album. EMI gave the Chili Peppers $5,000 to make a demo tape. The band worked with Keith Levene, one of the original members of the Clash, to make the album. Levene and Slovak saved $2,000 dollars from the money to spend on drugs. They did not tell this to the rest of the band. This made the other members mad. Kiedis and Flea fired Martinez. After this, they hired Jack Irons again.

Kiedis and Slovak were addicted to heroin. Their addictions got worse as the band was making "The Uplift Mofo Party Plan". Kiedis was not helping the band make much music because of his addiction. He was asked to leave the band to go to a treatment place. While he was there, the band won the "LA Weekly" Band of the Year Award. Because of this, Kiedis decided to stop using heroin. He visited his mother in Michigan, and she took him to another treatment place owned by the Salvation Army. He lived with his mother after being treated for 20 days. It was the first time he was not using drugs since he was 11 years old. After he was done, Kiedis felt much better. He wrote the lyrics to "Fight Like a Brave" while on an airplane going back to Los Angeles. He joined the band again to record the album.

While Kiedis was getting treated, the band wanted to get a new producer. Michael Beinhorn was looking for work at EMI after he had produced other music. None of it was very successful. A man from EMI talked to Beinhorn, and asked him to work with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Beinhorn liked the band's music and how they acted. He wanted to meet the band. They told him to meet them at a club in New Orleans named Tipitina's. Beinhorn decided to work with the band. Kiedis talked to Beinhorn about how the album was going to be made. Kiedis wanted to record the album in ten days, and write the songs during this time.

The album was recorded in Capitol Studios Studio B in Hollywood. Kiedis was having withdrawal while making the album, and did not make as much music as he did before. After not doing drugs for fifty days, he decided to take drugs again because he made new music. This made him addicted to drugs again. Making the album was difficult, because Kiedis left many times to find drugs. Beinhorn said that he "really thought the record wasn't gonna get made." Kiedis felt bad whenever he was not recording music with the band, so he tried to write music and find drugs at the same time. The band was not happy that he was using drugs and did not show up to make music. However, they were impressed with how much music he wrote.

The band had fun recording the album. They were inspired by Jack Irons being in the band again. Beinhorn wanted the band to do different things with the music on the album. Although the band wanted to make the same type of music they already made, they later thought Beinhorn was helping them make better music. Slovak helped Kiedis record his singing on the album. In between recording songs, Slovak ran around and said "This is the most beautiful thing we've ever done." During a jam session, Slovak made a guitar riff that sounded different from the band's music. Slovak almost stopped using the riff because it was very different from the music the band had already made. However, Beinhorn helped him make it into a full song. Every member of the band started making music for it. The song became one of the album's singles. It was named "Behind the Sun".

While the album was being made, Beinhorn told Kiedis to rap less, and sing more. At the time, Kiedis did not like his singing voice. He also thought the new style was too cliché. On "The Uplift Mofo Party Plan", Slovak played music that was different from funk, such as reggae and extreme metal. Slovak used a talk box on the song "Funky Crime". He sang into a tube to use the talk box. This let him make different sounds while playing the guitar. Flea used a different style of playing the bass guitar on the album. He would slap the strings to make different sounds. This was something he did on many of the band's other albums. The album has a cover version of "Subterranean Homesick Blues" by Bob Dylan. It is in a Red Hot Chili Peppers style.

Many of the lyrics on the album were about the band members, sex, and life in Los Angeles. Many of the lyrics were inspired by Slovak, Kiedis, Flea and Irons being in the band again. They were happy that they could make music together again. Kiedis was also inspired by his own life when writing music. While the band was making "Freaky Styley", Kiedis and Slovak used cocaine a lot. When Slovak was high, he would wear brightly colored clothes and dance in a weird way. This inspired the song "Skinny Sweaty Man". The song "No Chump Love Sucker" was also inspired by Slovak. While the album was being made, Slovak's girlfriend left him. She started dating someone who had "more money and more drugs". The band made the song about this.

"Funky Crime" was inspired by a conversation between the band and George Clinton. Clinton was the producer for "Freaky Styley". Kiedis said that the song was a description of the conversation. It is about how music is "color-blind" but it separated by the media based on what it thinks about musicians. Kiedis wrote "Me and My Friends" while driving home from San Francisco with his friend Joe Walters. "Backwoods" is about the history of rock and roll. Kiedis said that "Love Trilogy" is one of the band's favorite songs. It is about loving things that are not perfect.

EMI did not want to release the album unless the band changed the name of the song "Party on your Pussy". The band renamed the song to "Special Secret Song Inside". "The Uplift Mofo Party Plan" was released on September 29, 1987. It got to number 148 on the "Billboard" 200. This was much more successful than the band's other albums. It was the band's first album on the "Billboard" 200. The album has been certified gold in the United States. The band made a music video for the song "Fight Like a Brave". This was the album's main single. It did not go on any "Billboard" charts. "Behind the Sun" was released as a single in 1992. It was released for a compilation album named "What Hits!?". It got to number 7 on the "Billboard" Alternative Songs chart.

The album also helped Red Hot Chili Peppers get more fans in Los Angeles. One of these fans was John Frusciante. He later joined the band to play the guitar after Slovak died. Frusciante's way of playing the guitar was inspired by Slovak.

The band went on a long concert tour for the album. They went to many different countries for it. The band noticed that there were more people at their concerts. Kiedis said that the fans had more energy as well. Flea said that "We were in love with those songs and how much fun we were having playing them."

The band was happy that they had more fans. However, Kiedis and Slovak were still addicted to drugs. Both of them stopped using heroin before the tour. They helped each other not use the drug. During the tour, both of them had drug withdrawal. Slovak had much worse symptoms than Kiedis. He was worse at playing the guitar because of his withdrawal. At one concert, Slovak had a mental breakdown and did not play the guitar. The band played the concert without Slovak. They did not have anyone playing the guitar. Slovak got better, but the band did not want it to happen again. They hired DeWayne McKnight to play guitar at a few concerts. After a few days playing with McKnight, the band wanted to let Slovak play again. He played with the band at many concerts in Europe. Kiedis tried to get a counselor for Slovak to help him. However, Slovak did not think his addiction was bad enough to need treatment.

When the band came back to Los Angeles, Slovak stayed away from the other members of the band. When he was not getting support from his friends, Slovak had trouble avoiding drugs. A few weeks after the band got to Los Angeles, they tried to find Slovak. They could not find him for many days. Slovak was found dead by police in his apartment on June 27, 1988. He died because of a heroin overdose. Irons left the band because of Slovak's death. He said he did not want to be in a group his friends were dying in. Kiedis and Flea did not know if they should keep making music. They decided to make more music to continue what Slovak "helped build". The two hired John Frusciante. Frusciante was a fan of the Chili Peppers, and liked how Slovak played the guitar. The group also needed a new drummer, because Irons left. They hired Chad Smith.

Wishing to show the New Thought movement in a simple nature, Morrissey wrote the book "New Thought: A Practical Spirituality." Published by Penguin in 2002, the book was made of short essays from 40 New Thought leaders. The book was used for academic work: in the book "Alternative Psychotherapies" Jean Mercer referred to it as a key book for understanding the "engagement with the spiritual world." In Jones & Bartlett's 2009 book, "Spirituality, Health, and Healing", authors Young and Koopsen wrote that Morrissey's "New Thought" was important for understanding the difference between the New Thought movement and New Age, writing that "New Thought is not New Age".

Sellafield

Sellafield, formerly known as Windscale, is a large nuclear site on the coast of Cumbria, England. Now it mostly does nuclear waste processing and storage and nuclear decommissioning. It used to be a nuclear power plant from 1956 to 2003, and nuclear fuel reprocessing from 1952 to 2022. It is a big place, 265 hectares (650 acres), and has more than 200 nuclear facilities and more than 1,000 buildings.

In December 2023, media wrote about a leak from a silo of radioactive waste.

The leak has been known since 2019, according to a middle manager at Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority; Furthermore, some radioactive water is leaking thru a crack in the silo; Furthermore, she says (in 2023) that the leak is not dangerous for Norway, and it has no consequence for Norway. 
The silo in question is the Magnox swarf storage silo.

Mobile discotheques in UK

Silver Sounds Mobile Discotheque

One of the earliest mobile discotheques in Britain started out in Brighton, Sussex in 1967. At that time the Brighton Pavilion Young Conservatives held a weekly dance every Friday evening when, apart from a live group, vinyl was the only form of entertainment available.

Based on the success of these Friday get-togethers one of the members, Roger Wheeler, conceived the idea of setting up a mobile form of entertainment based on the Friday evening format initially using the Young Conservative's equipment for the first few events. He was joined in this venture by Paul Dennis, another Young Conservative, with the shows hosted by Wheeler and Dennis usually as a pair but sometimes with just one as the DJ.

The partnership continued their venture until Dennis left in January 1970 to travel to and work in Australia and the Far East.

As the original equipment belonged to the Brighton Pavilion Young Conservatives it could not continue to be used by the new venture and an uncle of Roger's was able to construct a system consisting of an amplifier, speakers, a mixer and two Garrard floating decks with the latter used to create stability wherever used.

Steady progress in the early years led to expansion of the areas covered to North Sussex, South Surrey and Kent.

Whilst sounding primitive by modern day standards it was a successful addition to musical entertainment in this era especially as the start-up had been greeted with so much scepticism by many at the time but copied by so many since.

Catholic Church sexual abuse cases

There have been cases where priests, monks, nuns, or other educators of the Catholic Church have sexually abused other people. Most were children, but some were adults. Most priests, monks and nuns have given a vow of celibacy. This means that they said they would not have sex with anyone.

There have been rules of the church how to deal with cases of abuse. Despite this, many of these cases have long been ignored by the church. Since the 1990s, media attention about the subject has increased. Many victims came forward and reported cases of abuse. Some cases happened decades earlier. Most likely, many cases are not reported at all. 

In the last few years, there had been scandals involving sexual abuse in Ireland, the United States, and other countries.

A study that looked at cases of sexual abuse in the church in the United States, between 1950 and the early 2000s found that 81% of the victims were male. Two years later, the same team published another report, with more detailed findings.

The abused are mostly boys but some are girls, some as young as three years old; most are 11 to 14 years old. The accusations of abuse and cover-ups began to receive public attention during the late 1980s. Cases have also been brought against members of the Catholic hierarchy who covered up sex abuse allegations and moved abusive priests to other parishes, where abuse continued.

By the 1990s, the cases began to receive a lot of media and public attention in countries such as Canada, United States, Chile, Australia and Ireland, and in much of Europe and South America. In 2002, an investigation by "The Boston Globe" led to widespread media coverage of the issue in the United States. Widespread abuse has been exposed in Europe, Australia, Chile, and the United States, reflecting worldwide patterns of long-term abuse as well as the Church hierarchy's pattern of regularly covering up reports of abuse.

From 2001 to 2010, the Holy See examined sex abuse cases involving about 3,000 priests, some of which dated back fifty years. Diocesan officials and academics knowledgeable about the Catholic Church say that sexual abuse by clergy is generally not discussed, and therefore difficult to measure. Members of the Church's hierarchy have argued that media coverage was excessive and disproportionate, and that such abuse also takes place in other religions and institutions. This annoyed critics who saw it as a device to avoid resolving the abuse problem within the Church.

In a 2001 apology, John Paul II called sexual abuse within the Church "a profound contradiction of the teaching and witness of Jesus Christ". Benedict XVI apologised, met with victims, and spoke of his "shame" at the evil of abuse, calling for perpetrators to be brought to justice, and denouncing mishandling by church authorities. In January 2018, referring to a particular case in Chile, Pope Francis accused victims of fabricating allegations; by April, he was apologizing for his "tragic error", and by August was expressing "shame and sorrow" for the tragic history. He convened a four-day summit meeting with the participation of the presidents of all the episcopal conferences of the world, which was held in Vatican City from 21 to 24 February 2019, to discuss preventing sexual abuse by Catholic Church clergy. In December 2019, Pope Francis made sweeping changes that allow for greater transparency. In June 2021, a team of U.N. special rapporteurs for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights criticized the Vatican, pointing to persistent allegations that the Catholic Church had obstructed and failed to cooperate with domestic judicial proceedings in order to prevent accountability for abusers and compensation for victims.

Some Christian media and institutions have criticized the reporting media for anti-Catholic bias. A report issued by Christian Ministry Resources in 2002 said that contrary to popular opinion, there are more allegations of child sexual abuse in Protestant congregations than Catholic ones, and that sexual violence is most often committed by volunteers rather than by priests themselves. The report also criticized the way the media reported sexual crimes, stating that the Australian media reported on sexual abuse allegations against Catholic clergy but ignored such allegations against Protestant churches. Stephen Joseph Rossetti, a Catholic priest, reported that the frequency of pedophilia amongst the Catholic clergy is no higher than among general population, and a Catholic priest is no more likely to be a pedophile than an average male.

Eugene Talmadge

Eugene Talmadge (September 23, 1884 – December 21, 1946) was an American attorney and politician. He was the 55th governor of Grorgia. He was elected to be governor three times but only served two time. He served from 1933 until 1937 and from 1941 until 1943. Talmadge died before he could be sworn in for the third time. He died of a liver problem. His death caused the three governors controversy. 

Kishore Kumar

Kishore Kumar (born Abhas Kumar Ganguly; ; 4 August 1929 – 13 October 1987) was an Indian playback singer and actor. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest, most influential and dynamic singers in the history of Indian music.
He was one of the most popular singers in the Indian subcontinent, notable for his yodeling and ability to sing songs in different voices. He used to sing in different genres but some of his rare compositions, considered classics, were lost in time. According to his brother and legendary actor Ashok Kumar, Kishore Kumar was successful as a singer because his "voice hits the mike, straight, at its most sensitive point".

Besides Hindi, he sang in many other Indian languages, including Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Malayalam, Odia and Urdu. He also released a few non-film albums in multiple languages, especially in Bengali, which are noted as all-time classics.

He won 8 Filmfare Awards for Best Male Playback Singer and holds the record for winning the most Filmfare Awards in that category. He was awarded the Lata Mangeshkar Award by the Madhya Pradesh government in 1985.

In 1997, the Madhya Pradesh Government initiated an award called the "Kishore Kumar Award" for contributions to Hindi cinema. In 2012, his unreleased last song sold for 15.6 lakh at the Osian's Cinefan Auction in New Delhi.

Shocker (character)

Shocker is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Stan Lee and John Romita Sr, and debuted in "The Amazing Spider-Man" #46 in March 1967. He is mainly an antagonist in the Spider-Man comic book series. At least two men, Herman Schultz and Jackson Bruce, have assumed the identity of the said supervillain.

Schultz was originally a self-taught engineer and renowned safe cracker who invented a pair of gauntlets capable of producing powerful vibrational shock waves. He incorporated these gauntlets into a protective battlesuit and became a mercenary for hire. As the Shocker, Schultz quickly rose in New York City's criminal underworld and has been employed by various crime lords, which has often put him into conflict with Spider-Man. One notable trait that differentiates the Shocker from most other Spider-Man villains is his pursuit of wealth and a comfortable life rather than revenge or chaos. As a result, he has sometimes put aside his differences with Spider-Man and has helped him or other heroes when it was in his best interest.

The character has been adapted from the comics into various forms of media, having been voiced by Jim Cummings in , Jeff Bennett in "The Spectacular Spider-Man", and David B. Mitchell in the video game "Spider-Man". Two iterations of the character were featured in the 2017 Marvel Cinematic Universe movie "", with Herman Schultz portrayed by Bokeem Woodbine and Jackson Price portrayed by Logan Marshall-Green.

Wings of Fire

Wings of Fire is a series of children's epic dragon fantasy novels written by Tui T. Sutherland. It has sold 14 million copies around the world.

The "Wings of Fire" series focuses on the adventures and endeavors of young dragons ("dragonets") to fulfill or stop prophecies and make their world a better place. There are two continents filled with dragons in the world of "Wings of Fire", and these dragons are split into ten tribes based on their biological characteristics - on Pyrrhia, there are the MudWings, SandWings, SkyWings, SeaWings, RainWings, IceWings and NightWings, and on Pantala, there are the SilkWings, HiveWings and LeafWings. With a few exceptions to each rule, the dragon tribes live separately from one another in a habitat suited to their needs, and are ruled by a queen. There are also humans in the world, usually called "scavengers" by the Pyrrhian dragons and "reading monkeys" by some Pantalan dragons, though humans are usually eaten and considered inferior animals. Despite this, at times the books explore the relationship between humans and dragons.

The books are written by Tui T. Sutherland and edited by Amanda Maciel, and they are published by Scholastic Inc. The cover art is drawn by Joy Ang, and the maps were made by Mike Schley.

There are five books in the first arc: "The Dragonet Prophecy" (2012), "The Lost Heir" (2013), "The Hidden Kingdom" (2013), "The Dark Secret" (2013), and "The Brightest Night" (2014). These respectively star the dragonets Clay, Tsunami, Glory, Starflight and Sunny as the protagonists. The five heroes are collectively called the "Dragonets of Destiny", a group of young dragons predicted by a mysterious prophecy to be the saviors of Pyrrhia who will end the twenty-year-long War of SandWing Succession by choosing the next queen of the SandWings.

There are five books in the second arc: "Moon Rising" (2014), "Winter Turning" (2015), "Escaping Peril" (2015), "Talons of Power" (2016), and "Darkness of Dragons" (2017). These respectively star the dragonets Moonwatcher, Winter, Peril, Turtle and Qibli as the protagonists. The books take place on Pyrrhia six months after the War of SandWing Succession has ended, at the newly-founded Jade Mountain Academy where dragons from all tribes can learn together; the protagonists are students at the school who are faced with a sinister new prophecy that threatens not only the school but possibly the entire world.

There are five books in the third arc: "The Lost Continent" (2018), "The Hive Queen" (2018), "The Poison Jungle" (2019), "The Dangerous Gift" (2021), and "The Flames of Hope" (2022). These respectively star Blue, Cricket, Sundew, Snowfall and Luna as the protagonists. It takes place on Pantala, where another prophecy predicts the destruction of the world if mind-controlling tyrant Queen Wasp is not stopped.

Two special edition books called "Legends" have also been written: "Darkstalker" (2016), which tells the "true story" of the legendary historical figures Darkstalker, Clearsight and Fathom, and "Dragonslayer" (2020), about three humans during the end of the War of SandWing Succession.

Four short stories called "Winglets" have been written: "Prisoner" (2015), "Assassin" (2015), "Deserter" (2016) and "Runaway" (2016). These tell stories from the view of secondary characters from the main books (Fierceteeth, Deathbringer, Six-Claws, Arctic, Foeslayer, Snowflake). These short stories have been published in print several times, most notably altogether in "The Winglets Quartet" (2020).

Several companion books to "Wings of Fire" have also been written: "Forge Your Dragon World" and an "Official Coloring Book" (both 2022). There will soon be two additional companion books: "A Guide to the Dragon World" and "How to Draw" (both 2023). The main books are also being adapted into graphic novel format.

The "Wings of Fire" series has sold 14 million copies, making it a commercial success, and it has received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics. It has developed a significant fan following.

The books' themes have also been noted. Sutherland works with several big themes in each arc, and writes the books with big emphasis on character interaction. Themes include freedom versus fate, parenting, expectations, nature versus nurture, giftedness, and the meaning of responsibility. She also explores mind-reading, prophecy and the role of magic in fantasy literature with her concept of "animus magic" - magic that comes at the cost of a dragon's soul. Additionally, Sutherland's unique religious and multicultural upbringing (being exposed to many different ideas and cultures because she's lived and traveled all over the world) has been noted.

First Mexican Republic

The First Mexican Republic, known also as the First Federal Republic (), was a federated republic, established by the Constitution of 1824, the first constitution of independent Mexico. It was officially named the United Mexican States (, ). The First Mexican Republic lasted from 1824 to 1835, when conservatives under Antonio López de Santa Anna changed it into a unitary state, the Centralist Republic of Mexico.

The republic was announced on November 1, 1823 by the Supreme Executive Power, months after the fall of the Mexican Empire ruled emperor Agustin I, a former royalist military officer-turned-insurgent for independence. The federation was formally and legally established on October 4, 1824, when the Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States came into force.

The First Republic was badly harmed and bothered through its whole twelve-year existence by extreme financial and by not having a steady, trustworthy goverment. Political controversies, ever since the drafting of the constitution tended to center around whether Mexico should be a federal or a centralist state, with wider liberal and conservative causes attaching themselves to each group of people involved in a battle respectively. With the exception of the inaugural office holder, Guadalupe Victoria, every single administration (management) during the First Republic was permanently ended by military coup d'état.

The First Republic would finally collapse after the permanent end of the liberal president Valentín Gómez Farías, through a rebellion led by his former vice-president, General Antonio López de Santa Anna who had switched sides. Once in power, the conservatives, who had long been critical of the federal system and blamed it for the nation's instability, repealed the Constitution of 1824 on October 23, 1835, and the Federal Republic became a unitary state, the Centralist Republic. The unitary regime was formally established on December 30, 1836, with the doing of the seven constitutional laws.

The Spanish Empire fell apart after Napoleon's invasion of Spain and the permanent end of the Spanish Bourbons in 1808. Throughout Spain and her colonies there was a widespread refusal to recognize Napoleon's brother Joseph II as the new French-backed king of Spain. The cleric Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who had long been part of a circle of smart people who tried to reform the colonial system triggered the Mexican War of Independence in 1810 by accusing the Spanish ruling classes of seeking to recognize Joseph Bonaparte, while announcing loyalty to the imprisoned Ferdinand VII. The subsequent uprising would go on to seriously threaten the capital yet it was ultimately defeated within a year and Hidalgo was captured and executed.

The war would continue and be organized under Jose Maria Morelos who would gain control over much of southern New Spain. At the Congress of Chilpancingo in 1813 he rejected loyalty to Ferdinand and explained a plan for an independent, Republican Mexico. The Constitution of Apatzingán was approved on October 22, 1814, but it would never come into effect. The tide of war began to turn against the insurgents, and Morelos was captured and executed in 1815.

Meanwhile, in Spain, the Spanish government in exile, the liberal ruled Cortes of Cádiz had included representatives from the colonies, and taken into account many of the colonial complaints which were leading to independence. The resulting liberal Constitution of 1812, was announced and taught during the Morelos insurgency. It established a system of ‘provincial group of representatives’ which granted more autonomy to local governments in the colonies while also providing for freedom of speech. The newly freed Mexican press however simply made worse anti-Spanish feeling, Morelos' rebellion continued, and on the fake reason of need for controlling the rebels, the constitution was suspended in New Spain the same year it was announced, making Mexican liberals lose hope of reaching reform within the colonial system, while not forgetting the local provincial independence that they had temporarily been granted.

Independence was finally gained in 1821 under Agustín de Iturbide's Plan of Iguala which was a conservative reaction against the outbreak of the Trienio Liberal in Spain, but also an agreement with those Mexican liberals who searched for equality before the law. Mexico was to have its independence under a commonwealth system with constitutional monarchy maintaining ties to Spain and government workers in charge were sent to Spain to offer the throne to a Spanish prince. The Spanish government refused the offer and a popular demonstration led to Iturbide himself assuming the throne. The Emperor immediately however began to disagree with the government and showed himself determined to have supreme authority over the government, even shutting congress down and replacing it with a body of loyalists. Iturbide struggled to pay the army, and eventually Santa Anna said in favor of a Federal Republic in his Plan of Casa Mata. After being unable to hold back the rebellion Iturbide met again congress and offered his giving up after which he was permanently removed from the nation. He would attempt to return the following year while Mexico was under a temporary government only to be captured and executed.

Mary Ann Nichols

Mary Ann Nichols, known as Polly Nichols (née Walker; 26 August 184531 August 1888), was the first canonical victim of the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper is believed to have murdered and mutilated at least five women in and around the Whitechapel district of London from late August to early November 1888.

A person known as the Whitechapel murderer killed two more women, before Nichols was killed. Jack the Ripper most likely did not commit these murders. The murder of Mary Ann Nichols was origininally linked to this series as well. This increased both press and public interest into the criminal activity and general living conditions of the people of the East End of London.

Annie Chapman

Annie Chapman (born Eliza Ann Smith; 25 September 1840 – 8 September 1888) was the second victim of the unidentified serial killer Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper is believed to have killed and mutilated at least five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London between late August and early November 1888.

There are previous murders, linked to a person called the Whitechapel murderer. Jack the Ripper likely did not commit them, though. Because of these murders, there had been considerable press and public attention. When Annie Chapman was killed, this generated a state of panic in the East End of London. Police were put under more and more pressure to find the murderer.

Mary Jane Kelly

Mary Jane Kelly ( – 9 November 1888), also known as Marie Jeanette Kelly, Fair Emma, Ginger, Dark Mary and Black Mary, is widely believed to have been the last victim of the unidentified serial killer Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper murdered at least five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London between late August and early November 1888. When she was killed, Kelly was about 25 years old, working as a prostitute and living in relative poverty.

The other four victims were different: they had been killed outside. Their mutilations could have been done within minutes. Kelly was murdered inside, in the room that she rented at 13 Miller's Court. This gave her murderer a lot more time to mutilate her. Her murderer disemboweled her as well. Kelly's body was the most mutilated one of all the confirmed victims. Her murderer needed about two hours to perform these mutilations.

Whitechapel murders

The Whitechapel murders is the name for a number of murders which happened in the Whitechapel district of London, between 1888 and 1891. The district lies in what is called the East End of London. Over time, up to 11 murders have been counted as "Whitechapel murders". They happened between 3 April 1888 and 13 February 1891. None of the murders have been resolved.

Some, or all of the murders have been attributed to an unidentified serial killer called Jack the Ripper. At the time when the murders happened, people living in the area were poor. 

Most, if not all, of the victims—Emma Elizabeth Smith, Martha Tabram, Mary Ann "Polly" Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, Mary Jane Kelly, Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, Frances Coles, and an unidentified woman—were prostitutes. Smith was sexually assaulted and robbed by a gang. Tabram was stabbed 39 times. Nichols, Chapman, Stride, Eddowes, Kelly, McKenzie and Coles had their throats cut. Eddowes and Stride were murdered on the same night, within approximately an hour and less than a mile apart; their murders are known as the "double event". This was a phrase in a postcard sent to the press by someone who claimed to be the Ripper. The bodies of Nichols, Chapman, Eddowes and Kelly had abdominal mutilations. Mylett was strangled. The body of the unidentified woman was dismembered, but the exact cause of her death is unclear.

The Metropolitan Police, City of London Police, and private organisations such as the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee were actively involved in the search for the person or people who committed the murders. There were several enquiries, and several people were arrested. In the end, the people who committed the crimes were not found. The murders were never solved. The Whitechapel murders drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End slums, which were improved later. The enduring mystery of who committed the crimes has captured public imagination to the present day.

In the late Victorian era, Whitechapel was known as an area where many poor people lived. There was also a lot of crime in the area. The area around Flower and Dean Street was described as "perhaps the foulest and most dangerous street in the whole metropolis"; Dorset Street was called "the worst street in London". Assistant Police Commissioner Robert Anderson recommended Whitechapel to "those who take an interest in the dangerous classes" as one of London's prime criminal "show places". Robbery, violence and alcohol dependency were common. There was extreme poverty, sub-standard housing, poor sanitation, homelessness, drunkenness and prostitution. 

There were 233 common lodging-houses within Whitechapel, in which approximately 8,500 people slept on a nightly basis. They provided cheap communal lodgings for the desperate, the destitute and the transient, among whom were the Whitechapel murder victims. The nightly price of a single bed was 4d () and the cost of sleeping upon a "lean-to" rope stretched across the bedrooms was 2d for adults or children.

All the identified victims of the Whitechapel murders lived within the heart of the rookery in Spitalfields, including three in George Street (later named Lolesworth Street), two in Dorset Street, two in Flower and Dean Street and one in Thrawl Street.

Police work and criminal prosecutions at the time relied heavily on confessions, witness testimony, and catching people in the act of committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. Forensic techniques, such as fingerprint analysis, were not in use, and blood typing had not been invented. Policing in London was—and still is—divided between two forces: the Metropolitan Police with jurisdiction over most of the urban area, and the City of London Police with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9 km) of the city centre. The Home Secretary, a senior minister of the British government, controlled the Metropolitan Police, whereas the City Police were responsible to the Corporation of London. Beat constables walked regular, timed routes.

Jitterbug

Jitterbug is a basic name used to describe swing dancing. It is most related with the lindy hop dance but might add things from the jive, east coast swing, collegiate shag, charleston, balboa and other swing dances.

Swing dancing origins come from the African-American groups of New York City in the early 20th century. a lot of nightclubs had a whites-only or blacks-only policy due to racial segregation, though the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem had a rule which allowed whites and blacks to dance together and it was there that the lindy hop dance thrived, started by dancers such as George Snowden and Frank Manning. The term jitterbug was originally an insult used by african-americans to describe white people who started to dance the lindy hop, as they were dancing faster and jumpier than was intended, like "jittering bugs", although it quickly lost its bad reputation as the more fluid version caught on. Both the lindy hop and the "jitterbug" became popular outside New York City when the dance was featured in Hollywood movies.

Common lodging-house

In Victorian era England, a common lodging-house was a kind of cheap hotel. There were a number of common rooms, which people used for either eating or sleeping. This meant that people who were not part of the same family ate and slept together. Today, the closest equivalent to this would probably be a hostel. 

Very often, criminals and prostitutes lived in such houses. In the mid-19th century, the common lodging houses in London were in a very bad condition. This prompted the Common Lodging Houses Acts 1851 and 1853. These regulations, however proved ineffectual and the requirement that residents leave between 10 a.m. and late afternoon hit poor and sick residents hard, as they were obliged to walk the streets during this time, in all weathers.

Even tighter control was imposed when regulation of common lodging houses was transferred from the police to the London County Council in 1894. This led to higher standards and regular inspection by council officials. The new regulations required the landlords to limewash the walls and ceilings twice a year and the mixed sex accommodation, which was frequently a cover for a brothel, was abolished. Proper beds and bedding had also to be provided instead of mattresses on the floor and worse.

Elizabeth Stride

Elizabeth "Long Liz" Stride ( Gustafsdotter; 27 November 1843 – 30 September 1888) was probably the third victim of the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper killed and mutilated at least five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London between late August and early November 1888.

Unlike the other four Ripper victims, Stride had not been mutilated after her murder. For this reason, some historians think Stride had not actually been murdered by Jack the Ripper. However, Stride's murder occurred less than one hour before the murder of the Ripper's fourth victim, Catherine Eddowes. The murder occured within walking distance. It is thought that the murderer was disturbed by someone entering the crime scene on a two-wheeled cart. In addition, both women had been murdered by slash wounds to the throat. For these reasons, most authors and researchers consider Stride to be the third of the Ripper's five victims.

Stride was nicknamed "Long Liz". Several explanations have been given for this pseudonym; some believe it sources from her married surname (a stride being a reference to a long step), while others believe this is a reference to either her height, or her general facial structure.

Catherine Eddowes

Catherine Eddowes (14 April 1842 – 30 September 1888) was the fourth of the five victims of the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper is believed to have killed and mutilated at least five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London between late August and early November 1888.

Eddowes was murdered in the early hours of Sunday 30 September within the City of London. She was the second woman killed within an hour. Elizabeth Stride had already been killed, the same night, likely by the same person. These two murders are commonly referred to as the "double event"; a term which originates from the content of the "Saucy Jacky" postcard received at the Central News Agency on 1 October.

Part of a left human kidney, accompanied by a letter addressed "From Hell" and postmarked 15 October, was later sent to the chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, George Lusk. The author of this letter claimed the section of kidney was from Eddowes, whose left kidney had been removed, and that he had fried and eaten the other half. Most experts, however, do not believe this kidney actually originated from Eddowes's body.

Kulturzentrum Bremgarten

Kulturzentrum Bremgarten (KuZeB) is a Swiss community place where events can be held. It began in 1992 as a result of a squat (illegally taken over building). It is located at Zürcherstrasse 2 in Bremgarten. It is an important place for autonomous people in the canton of Aargau and for people who are interested in social, cultural and political issues. There are many events there such as concerts, readings, discussions, information and advice. The buildings are from a former clothing factory that was built in 1893.

It consists of a house and two factory buildings.

The Biedermeier home is located on Obertorplatz in Bremgarten. It was built in 1838 by a builder called Fidel Leimbacher. It housed many famous people before it went to the brothers Max and Simon Meyer. They started a business there in 1893, making clothes for men and for people who work for a job. The factory grew bigger and better. It is a typical example of a small factory and an important example of New Building (this is a special type of building). The core building (main part) is a two-storey Biedermeier house with an attic (a special room under the roof). There are also other parts that were added to the back in 1880, 1911/1912 and 1928/1929.

The "Meyer & Co." factory building was built in 1928/1929. The architect's name is Johann Emil Ganz. It is made of concrete, has a lot of windows and is flat on the top. It follows the ideas of the New Building Movement (a group of people who wanted buildings to look a certain way). There are two big rooms in the building, which measure 12 x 19.6 metres. They are very bright. It is an example of factory architecture of pre-modernism. It shows the rich history of the clothing factory.

Today, the building complex does not look the same. It is included (listed) in the "Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites (ISOS)" (a list of places that are important to Swiss history and culture) because this place is important for Bremgarten.

In June 1990, some young people took control of the buildings. That had not been used for a long time. A Spanish club and a single person lived in the living part of the building. The squatters turned the building into an "autonomous space" (a place where they could do whatever they wanted). They built a half pipe (a U-shaped ramp for skateboarding) and two band rooms (places for musical groups to practice) in the basement. Max Meyer, one of the owners, knew they were using the building, but he did nothing. That's why the authorities couldn't do anything. So the factory project ran until New Year's Day 1991.

In spring 1991, the squatters started the . They wanted to talk about a rent with the owners. But the discussions did not work. In April 1991, the city had said they must leave.

But parties were still held in the old buildings. On 7 December 1991, a group of people with extreme right-wing views entered the factory and tried to take over. The owners had to close the buildings by 15 February 1992. At the same time, the electricity company threatened to cut off the power.

The activists started a fresh attempt to form the organization "KuZeB" to keep up. They made a concept of use and gave it to the owners of the property and the authorities. There was a suggestion to close the building. But the activists argued and asked the owners not to and the owners said yes. The people liked it and the city government confirmed that they never said no to renting.

So 18 March 1992 is the day when the "Kulturzentrum Bremgarten" started.

The Whitsun market was very popular (an annual event). In August 1992, the Spanish club moved away and KuZeB took over the place. On 27 August 1992 KuZeB signed a rental contract which was not returned (agreed to by the other side). But the relatives of the previous owner of the factory still get a small rent since 30 years. The rest is 'squatted'. Now the concept for how the building will be used was put in place bit by bit.

Now, KuZeB is the oldest self-governing social centre in Switzerland, it comes without any public money.

On 7 June 2002, the police of Aargau canton searched the Kulturzentrum Bremgarten. They took a banner that was hanging from the house. The banner had a symbol of a swastika crossed out inside a sign that means "no." The search happened because someone was accused of breaking the law against racism. In a statement, the people who run KuZeB described the action as both strange and a form of political satire.

Authorities tried to control the KuZeB. They made a rule which would have put the centre under the rules for providing a place to stay. That would have meant the end of KuZeB. But the government decided that KuZeB should not be thought of as a business and so was not covered by the hospitality law.

On 29 May 2018, a group of police searched the buildings. A young man from Aargau is suspected of having done bad things in Hamburg during the G20 riots. He was not there when the police searched. But they searched his home and the social centre anyway and took many data carriers (things that can store information, like a computer or a phone). Later he was arrested (taken into custody) near Winterthur.

Andreas Glarner is a hardliner of the SVP (Swiss People's Party, a party and politician who holds strong right-wing views). He wants to remove the KuZeB. Max Meyer has people who want to buy the KuZeB, but he doesn't want to sell it. Bremgarten had been in the news in 2013. Asylum seekers (people looking for safety) were forbidden to go to public institutions. Glarner said that he would buy the building to prevent asylum seekers from going to KuZeB. Then unknown persons sprayed paint the meeting place of the SVP general meeting. Now Glarner is even more against the KuZeB.

The KuZeB has many things to offer. There are concerts, readings, film screenings and lectures. It has two stages with bars, a cinema (for watching films), a hackerspace (for people interested in computer technology), a freeshop (a shop where people can get things for free), an infoshop (a shop where people can get information), studios for sewing (using fabric to make clothes), printing and painting. It also has a wood and metal workshop (for making things out of wood or metal), a multi-purpose hall (a room for many different kinds of activities) with a half-pipe (for skateboarding) and a fitness area (for exercising), a room for bands (for rehearsing music) and a large garden. You can do a lot there.

KuZeB wants to find new ways in which everyone has equal rights and responsibilities. These ideas include humanity (being kind and caring), solidarity (working together), freedom of expression (being able to say what you think), trust (believing people), integration (bringing different people together), diversity (having different types of people) and openness (being welcoming). These paths are to show others that there are other possibilities. The association offers young people the chance to try out their ideas.

Index (database)

A database index is any data structure that improves the performance of lookup and sorting compared to a full table scan, for example, or a full DB scan. As well as traditional SQL DBs or Relational DB Management Systems (RDBMS), indexing is also implemented by most noSQL DBs for semi-structured data, such as Document DBs and Graph DBs. 

There are many different data structures used for indexes, partly depending on the type of database. In an RDBMS, for example, this could be thought of as making the chosen index column faster to search than an unindexed version of the column, thereby finding that whole row faster. 

Different types of database also have different limitations regarding indices. Some Document DBs, for example, will not return any data to a query if that data is not indexed.

The benefits of indexing is not without cost. There are trade-offs involving lookup performance, index size, and index-update performance. As so often with design, this means that the best way to set up your indexing depends on your intended usage and resources.

Language poetry

Language poetry is a different way of thinking about poetry that began in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. It was a reaction to the usual ways of writing poetry in America. It came from poets in San Francisco and New York City. The poems were printed in "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E" and other magazines.

Language poems made readers think about how words (spoken or written) could come before meanings. Meanings are made by language. "By breaking up poetic language, the poet is requiring the reader to find a new way to approach the text."

Some poets who are connected to this way of writing are Charles Bernstein, Bruce Andrews, Barrett Watten, Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman, and Rae Armantrout.

Emma Elizabeth Smith

Emma Elizabeth Smith ( 1843 – 4 April 1888) was a prostitute and murder victim of mysterious origins in late-19th century London. Her killing was the first of the Whitechapel murders. It is possible she was a victim of the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, though this is considered unlikely by most modern authors.

Smith's life before her murder in 1888 remains mysterious. Police files were gathered during the investigation, but most of these are missing, apparently taken, mislaid or discarded from the Metropolitan Police archive before the transfer of papers to the Public Record Office. In the surviving records, Inspector Edmund Reid notes a "son and daughter living in Finsbury Park area". Walter Dew, a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote:

At the time of her death in 1888, Smith was living in a lodging-house at 18 George Street (since renamed Lolesworth Street), Spitalfields, in the East End of London. She was viciously assaulted at the junction of Osborn Street and Brick Lane, Whitechapel, in the early hours of Tuesday 3 April 1888, the day after the Easter Monday bank holiday. She survived the attack and, although injured, managed to walk back to her lodging house. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she was attacked by two or three men, one of whom was a teenager. Mrs Russell and one of the other lodgers, Annie Lee, took Smith to the London Hospital, where she was treated by house surgeon George Haslip. She fell into a coma and died the next day at 9 a.m. Medical investigation by the duty surgeon, Dr G. H. Hillier, revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her peritoneum. The police were not informed of the incident until 6 April when they were told an inquest was to be held the next day. The inquest at the hospital, which was conducted by the coroner for East Middlesex, Wynne Edwin Baxter, was attended by Russell, Hillier, and the local chief inspector of the Metropolitan Police Service, H Division Whitechapel: John West. The inquest jury returned a verdict of murder by person or persons unknown.

Chief Inspector West placed the investigation in the hands of Inspector Edmund Reid of H Division. Reid noted in his report that her clothing was "in such dirty ragged condition that it was impossible to tell if any part of it had been fresh torn". Walter Dew later described the investigation:

Smith had not provided descriptions of the men who had attacked her and no witnesses came forward or were found. The investigation proved fruitless and the murderer or murderers were never caught.

The case was the first of eleven Whitechapel murders in Metropolitan Police files. Although some of the press linked her death to the later murders, which were blamed on a single serial killer known as "Jack the Ripper", her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings. With the exception of Walter Dew, who said he thought that Smith was the first victim of the Ripper, the police suspected it was the unrelated work of a criminal gang. Smith either refused to or could not describe her attackers in any form of detail, possibly because she feared reprisal. Prostitutes were often managed by gangs, and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as part of their intimidation.


Martha Tabram

Martha Tabram (née White; 10 May 1849 – 7 August 1888) was an English woman killed in a spate of violent murders in and around the Whitechapel district of East London between 1888 and 1891. She may have been the first victim of the still-unidentified Jack the Ripper.

The Avengers is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, who are one of the many teams part of Earth's defense, protecting the world from extraterrestrial and supernatural threats. They were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, and made its debut in "The Avengers" #1 (September 1963). Labeled <nowiki>"</nowiki>Earth's Mighties Heroes<nowiki>"</nowiki>, the original Avengers consisted of Iron Man, Ant-Man, Hulk, Thor and the Wasp. Captain America was discovered trapped in ice in issue #4, and joined the group after they revived him.

Other characters have later joined the team, such as Spider-Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Black Panther, Vision, She-Hulk, Hercules, Wolverine, and Captain Marvel.

They also appear in many television series and movies, most of them set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).


Wasp (character)

The Wasp (Janet Van Dyne) is a fictional character and superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, appearing as one of the main characters of the "Avengers" comics. Created by the late Stan Lee, the late Jack Kirby and the late Ernie Hart, the character first appeared in "Tales to Astonish" #44 (June 1963).

The Wasp is the partner of Hank Pym (also known as Ant-Man), and later became his wife. She is usually depicted as having the ability to shrink to a height of several centimeters, fly by means of insectoid wings, and fire bioelectric energy blasts. She is a founding member of the Avengers as well as a longtime leader of the team, and was a member of the Defenders and the Lady Liberators.

The character has appeared in numerous media since her debut, such as in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, making a cameo appearance in the 2015 movie "Ant-Man," and a full appearance in the 2018 movie "Ant-Man and the Wasp", the 2019 movie "", and the 2023 movie "", played by Michelle Pfeiffer and Hayley Lovitt (younger). An original MCU Wasp, Janet's daughter Hope van Dyne (named after Hope Pym), is played in each movie by Evangeline Lilly.


Turkish War of Independence

The Turkish War of Independence (also known as the Turkish War of Liberation) was a military conflict waged by the Turkish National Movement against the Allied Powers after World War I. The war lasted from 1919 to 1923 and resulted in the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923.

After World War I, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned by the victorious Allied Powers. The Treaty of Sèvres, signed in 1920, stripped the Ottoman Empire of its territories and imposed severe restrictions on its sovereignty. In response, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, a former Ottoman military commander, led a national movement to resist foreign occupation and defend Turkish independence.

The Turkish National Movement fought a successful campaign against the Allied Powers and their local proxies, including the Armenian, Greek, and French forces. The conflict was marked by several key battles, including the Battle of Sakarya in 1921 and the Battle of Dumlupınar in 1922.

In 1922, the Turkish National Movement launched a major offensive that pushed the Greek forces out of western Anatolia. This victory paved the way for the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, which recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey and established its modern borders. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk became the first president of Turkey and oversaw a series of sweeping reforms to modernize the country and transform it into a secular, democratic state.

The Turkish War of Independence is a significant event in Turkish history, as it marked the end of the Ottoman Empire and the beginning of a new era in Turkish history, characterized by secularism, modernization, and a strong sense of national identity.

Mirza Sahiban

Mirza Sahiban is a famous tragic love story from Punjab, a region in South Asia. It is a tale of two lovers, Mirza and Sahiban, whose love was doomed due to social conventions and family pressures.

According to the legend, Mirza and Sahiban grew up together in a small village in Punjab. They were childhood friends who eventually fell in love with each other. However, Sahiban's brothers disapproved of their relationship, as Mirza was from a rival tribe. Despite their families' objections, Mirza and Sahiban continued to meet secretly and profess their love for each other.

One day, when Mirza was away from the village on a hunting trip, Sahiban's brothers arranged her marriage to someone else. Sahiban was heartbroken and desperate to escape the arranged marriage. She sent a message to Mirza, asking him to come and rescue her.

Mirza, who was deeply in love with Sahiban, immediately returned to the village to save her. But Sahiban was
nowhere to be seen, a few hours later, the news reached mirza that Sahiban has
been married and the Nikkah and wedding ceremonies had already happened.

After Mirza, whos heart was shattered into peices, was determined to save
his lover; he searched all of Punjab for Sahiban, and he luckily found her, after reuniting with eachother they were filled with joy, a few hours later they were both sleeping together under a tree but while Mirza was asleep, Sahiban snapped Mirza’s arrows so that Mirza wouldn’t kill Sahibans brothers, but unfortunately when she woke up, she was devasted to what she saw, Mirzas dead body was right next to her, soon after she grabbed one of the broken arrows and stabbed herself with it, ending her life.

The story of Mirza Sahiban has been told and retold in various forms of literature, music, and theater. It is often cited as a tragic example of how love can be thwarted by societal norms and family obligations.

University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust

The University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust provides adult district general hospital services for Birmingham as well as specialist treatments for all the West Midlands.

It runs the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Edgbaston, Heartlands Hospital, Solihull Hospital and Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield. In 2004 it was one of the first NHS Foundation Trusts in England. It merged with the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust in 2018. This gave it a turnover of £1.6 billion and 2,700 beds across the four main hospitals

In November 2022, 13.35% of nursing posts at the trust were empty, compared with an England average of 10%. In 2023 many of the staff were found to be worried about the 'toxic atmosphere and bullying at all levels of management'. Two investigations talked about a “medical patriarchy” and regular “misogynistic behaviour”. 

NHS Foundation Trusts

A foundation trust is a part of the National Health Service in England. They have some independence from the Department of Health and Social Care. As of March 2019 there were 151 foundation trusts.

They were started by Alan Milburn in 2002. The plan was that all the NHS trusts should become Foundation Trusts and run independently. This was an important part of the plan to set up a market system in the NHS which was the main idea of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Foundation trusts had members - a bit like shareholders - and the members elected a council of governors - a bit like company directors. In 2014 a report said that on the whole after 10 years, "Foundation Trusts [had]... not deepened in terms of democratic practice and participation".

By 2016, the differences between foundation trusts and other NHS trusts were small. Their independence went when almost all had to rely on money borrowed from the Department of Health, to which strings were attached.

Galaxy morphological classification

Galaxy morphological classification is a system used by astronomers to divide galaxies into groups based on their visual appearance. There are several schemes in use by which galaxies can be classified according to their morphologies, the most famous being the Hubble sequence, figured out by Edwin Hubble and later expanded by Gérard de Vaucouleurs and Allan Sandage. However, galaxy classification and morphology are now mostly done using computational methods and physical morphology.

The Hubble sequence is a morphological classification scheme for galaxies invented by Edwin Hubble in 1926.
It is often known like an everyday expression as the “Hubble tuning-fork” because of the shape in which it is usually represented. Hubble's scheme divides galaxies into three broad classes based on their visual appearance (originally on photographic plates):

These broad classes can be extended to enable finer honors of appearance and to include other types of galaxies, such as irregular galaxies, which have no obvious regular structure (either disk-like or ellipsoidal).

The Hubble sequence is often represented in the form of a two-pronged fork, with the ellipticals on the left (with the degree of ellipticity increasing from left to right) and the barred and unbarred spirals forming the two parallel prongs of the fork. Lenticular galaxies are placed between the ellipticals and the spirals, at the point where the two prongs meet the “handle”.

To this day, the Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in amateur astronomy.
Anyway, in June 2019, citizen scientists through Galaxy Zoo reported that the usual Hubble classification, especially concerning spiral galaxies, may not be supported, and may need updating.

The de Vaucouleurs system for classifying galaxies is a widely used extension to the Hubble sequence, first described by Gérard de Vaucouleurs in 1959. De Vaucouleurs argued that Hubble's two-dimensional classification of spiral galaxies—based on the tightness of the spiral arms and the presence or absence of a bar—did not acceptably describe the full range of watched galaxy morphologies. Especially, he argued that rings and lenses are important structural components of spiral galaxies.

The de Vaucouleurs system keeps Hubble's basic division of galaxies into ellipticals, lenticulars, spirals and irregulars. To make Hubble's scheme complete, de Vaucouleurs introduced a more detailed classification system for spiral galaxies, based on three morphological characteristics:

The different elements of the classification scheme are combined — in the order in which they are listed — to give the complete classification of a galaxy. For example, a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms and a ring is represented SAB(r)c.

Visually, the de Vaucouleurs system can be represented as a three-dimensional version of Hubble's tuning fork, with stage (spiralness) on the "x"-axis, family (barredness) on the "y"-axis, and variety (ringedness) on the "z"-axis.

De Vaucouleurs also selected numerical values to each class of galaxy in his scheme. Values of the numerical Hubble stage "T" run from −6 to +10, with negative numbers going along with early-type galaxies (ellipticals and lenticulars) and positive numbers to late types (spirals and irregulars). So, as a rough rule, lower values of "T" go along with a larger fraction of the stellar mass contained in a spheroid/bulge relative to the disk. The close guess mapping between the spheroid-to-total stellar mass ratio (M/M) and the Hubble stage is M/M=(10−T)/256 based on local galaxies.

Elliptical galaxies are divided into three 'stages': compact ellipticals (cE), normal ellipticals (E) and late types (E). Lenticulars are similarly subdivided into early (S), intermediate (S) and late (S) types. Irregular galaxies can be of type magellanic irregulars ("T" = 10) or 'compact' ("T" = 11).

The use of numerical stages allows for more quantitative studies of galaxy morphology.
The Yerkes scheme was created by American astronomer William Wilson Morgan. Together with Philip Keenan, Morgan also developed the MK system for the classification of stars through their spectra. The Yerkes scheme uses the spectra of stars in the galaxy; the shape, real and apparent; and the degree of the central concentration to classify galaxies.

So, for example, the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as kS5.

Henry Dundas

Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville (28 April, 1742 – 28 May 1811) was a Scottish politician and lieutenant of Prime Minister William Pitt. He was the most powerful politician in Scotland and held various different positions in the British government.

Dundas served as MP of Edinburgh, Lord Advocate of Scotland, Home Secretary, President of the Board of Control, Secretary of State for War and First Lord of the Admiralty during his career.

He was, however, a controversial figure. In 1792, Dundas advocated for the gradual abolition of the Atlantic slave trade over four years. However, abolitionist leaders wanted an immediate end to the slave trade.

There is a statue of him in Edinburgh named the Melville Monument. A street in Canada was named after him but in 2020 Toronto City Council voted to rename the street due to Dundas' actions in delaying the end of the slave trade.

Modern historians are divided over whether Dundas should be held responsible for prolonging the slave trade. Historians of the slave trade and the abolitionist movement, including David Brion Davis, Roger Anstey, Robin Blackburn, and Stephen Tomkins have commented that Dundas' actions delayed rather than facilitated abolition. According to Davis, "By making the abolition of the slave trade dependent on colonial reforms, Dundas suggested possibilities for indefinite delay." Stephen Mullen, a research associate at Glasgow University and historian of slavery and the Atlantic slave trade, has called Dundas "a great delayer" of abolition.

Other historians of British history have argued that delay was inevitable. Angela McCarthy notes that the revolutionary wars with France, and opposition in the House of Lords and in the royal family, presented enormous obstacles. Sir Tom Devine, whose publications include editing "Recovering Scotland's Slavery Past: The Caribbean Connection" (Edinburgh University Press, 2015), has said that blaming Dundas for delay in the abolition of the slave trade is "bad history" and ignores the wider political and economic factors that were the true causes of delay. Brian Young notes that in 1792, the motion for immediate cessation of the slave trade was heading for certain defeat. By inserting the word "gradual" into the motion, Young says Dundas ensured a successful vote for the ultimate abolition of the trade in slaves.

Seborga

Seborga is a small village in Italy, located near the border with France. It is a commune within the Province of Imperia. Seborga's main economic activities are agriculture and tourism. Seborga has an annual festival dedicated to Saint Bernard, the town's patron saint. It has a population of around 300.

In the early 1960s, Giorgio Carbona claimed that Seborga was historically a principality and was not formally included in the 1861 Italian unification. As such, he claimed that the town and its surrounding territory was an independent country from Italy. He was elected as the Prince of Seborga.

There has been no formal recognition of Giorgio Carbone's claims and no country currently recognises Seborga, making it a micronation.

Human developmental periods

The period of human development – a concept derived from psychoanalysis, in which the leading role is given to the conscious actions of the individual under the influence of the environment. Development is understood as an evolutionary process in which an individual achieves an increasingly higher level of integration through psychosocial crises. It is accomplished by solving difficulties related to changes on the levels on which it takes place: biological, psychological and social. Development is therefore the mutual adaptation of the individual and the environment.
The ego is a configuration that includes and controls conscious activities that synthesize and integrate past experiences with tasks currently appearing in the perceptual-cognitive field of the individual.



The driving force behind development is the occurrence of opposing tendencies and aspirations in man. This polarization occurs in two dimensions:






Development occurs in successive phases. Its course depends on the experience previously acquired by the individual. In each phase, a new system of biological, social, psychological obstacles emerge, causing crisis and exacerbating the struggle between the aspirations for progression and regression. To move to the next phase, all obstacles must be overcome. The solution to a psychosocial crisis occurs when the obstacles and pressures that have arisen at a given moment are incorporated into the structure of the ego as elements of a harmonious whole. Then the relative equilibrium is not so much recovered as achieved at a higher level of complexity.

Attachment theory is a theoretical system developed by British physician and psychoanalyst John Bowlby, focusing on the developmental importance of close, intimate, emotionally meaningful relationships. Attachment in this theoretical current has been described as a system of biological impulses necessary to ensure survival in the first years of his life. This trend deals with the effects of the negative impact on development of the loss of significant objects, i.e. biological caregivers as a result of depreciation of attention and involvement.In 1965, Mary Ainsworth created the Strange Situation Procedure as a way of assessing individual differences in attachment behavior through individual stress responses and safe shelter concepts.The theory of attachment is used in therapeutic practice, especially in the field of civil partnerships and in the ethological model of developmental psychology. An early attachment style can affect relationships with people. The attachment style model is established in early childhood and is a relational style in adulthood.

Constructivism is one of the paradigms in psychology that characterizes the concept of intellectual development as a process of active knowledge building. The individual independently creates the meaning of new information – by selecting, organizing and integrating information from other knowledge, often in the context of social interaction. The concept of intellectual development can be realized in an individual or social way. This theory assumes that the integration and building of knowledge is realized through cognitive processes and personal experiences, not through memorizing facts.

Carnage (character)

Carnage is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually as an adversary of Spider-Man and the archenemy of Venom, in particular the Eddie Brock incarnation of the character, although Carnage and Venom would join forces if their goals aligned. Carnage belongs to a race of amorphous parasitic extraterrestrial organisms known as Symbiotes, which form a symbiotic bond with their hosts and give them super-human abilities. Originating as an offspring of Venom, Carnage is much more powerful than its parent symbiote because of the symbiotes' biology, and is in many ways a darker version of him. Like Venom, Carnage has had multiple hosts over the years, but its most infamous one remains its first – killer Cletus Kasady, whose sadistic personality perfectly matches that of the symbiote. Other notable hosts include Ben Reilly, Karl Malus, and Norman Osborn, as well as Gwen Stacy in the alternate Ultimate Marvel continuity. The Carnage symbiote gave birth to its first significant offspring, Toxin, in 2004. 

The character made its first appearance in "The Amazing Spider-Man" #361 (April 1992), and was created by writer David Michelinie and artist Mark Bagley, although the first published artwork of Carnage was penciled by Chris Marrinan. 

Since its original introduction in comics, the character has been adapted into other forms of media, such as television series and video games. Woody Harrelson voiced Carnage in its first live-action appearance in the movie "" (2021), set in Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU), as well as portraying Cletus Kasady, reprising his cameo role from "Venom" (2018). In 2009, the Cletus Kasady version of Carnage was ranked as IGN's 90th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

Notes

List of stars in Sculptor

This is the list of notable stars in the constellation Sculptor, all the stars are sorted by decreasing brightness.

The Treachery of Images

The Treachery of Images is a painting by René Magritte, done in 1929. It shows a pipe, and has the text "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" ("this is not a pipe") below. When he painted it, Magritte was 30 years old. 

There are different interpretations of the work. A common one says that with the painting, Magritte wanted to say that the thing was a painting, and not a pipe which can be smoked. The idea is similar to the word "dog". That word doesn't bark, or wag its tail, either. Michel Foucault also did an interpretation, in 1973. Foucault says that an image of an object is different from the object itself. Also, by showing something that looks like a paradox, Magritte forces the viewer to think about what the "reality" of an object really is.

Straight-tusked elephant

The straight-tusked elephant ("Palaeoloxodon antiquus") is an extinct species of elephant. It lived in Europe and Western Asia during the Middle and Late Pleistocene (781,000–30,000 years ago).

The straight-tusked elephant probably lived in small herds, flourishing in interglacial periods, when its range went as far north as Great Britain. Skeletons found in association with stone tools and wooden spears suggest they were scavenged and hunted by early humans, including Neanderthals. It is the ancestral species of most dwarf elephants that lived on islands in the Mediterranean.

This led to the growth of larger, steam-powered mills in mill towns, like Manchester and Salford which had more than 50 mills by 1802.

The new jobs in the mills pulled people in from country areas and made the towns and cities grow. At first they often employed children. That was stopped by the Factory Acts. Many of the first mills were in Lancashire but they spread to the rest of the world. In 1860, there were 2650 cotton mills in Lancashire, employing 440,000 people.

The later ones limited the millworkers to a ten-hour day. After the 1860s more industries were brought within the Factory Acts.

There wasnt much enforcement until in 1833 a professional Factory Inspectorate was started. Before that it was down to local magistrates. The inspectors had the right to enter any cotton mill at work, and powers to introduce regulations. The inspectors are now part of the Health and Safety Executive.

Georgism

Georgism is a way of thinking about economics and land use. It is based on the ideas of Henry George, an American economist and social philosopher. Georgists believe that people should have equal access to the benefits of land, which is a natural resource. They argue that the value of land comes from the community, and that this value should be shared equally among all members of society.

Georgism proposes a system of taxation that is based on the value of land. This is called a "" or "single tax". The idea is that people should pay a tax on the value of the land they own, but not on any improvements they make to the land. This would discourage land speculation and encourage the efficient use of land. Georgists believe that this would also promote social justice, by reducing inequality and poverty.

Georgism has been influential in many areas of economics and social policy. It has been used to support environmental conservation, urban planning, and social welfare programs. Georgists have also been involved in political movements, such as the Progressive movement in the United States and the Social Credit movement in Canada.

Critics of Georgism argue that it would be difficult to implement in practice, and that it could lead to unintended consequences, such as a reduction in the supply of land for productive use. They also question the idea that the value of land is created solely by the community, and suggest that individuals also play a role in creating value.

Despite its critics, Georgism remains an important idea in economics and social policy. It continues to be studied and debated by scholars and policymakers around the world, as they search for ways to create a more just and equitable society.

Henry George

Henry George was an American economist who lived during the 19th century. He was born in Philadelphia in 1839 and died in New York City in 1897. George is best known for his book "Progress and Poverty", which had a big impact on economic thought and politics in America and around the world.

In "Progress and Poverty", George argued that land should be owned by the community as a whole, rather than by individuals. He believed that if land were treated as a common resource, rather than a commodity to be bought and sold, it would benefit everyone, not just the wealthy.

George's ideas became known as Georgism, and they continue to be influential in modern discussions about economics and social justice. Georgism proposes a tax on the unimproved value of land, which would replace other forms of taxation and create a more equitable society.

Aside from his economic work, George was also involved in politics. He ran for mayor of New York City in 1886 on the United Labor Party ticket, and received over 30% of the vote. His campaign focused on issues of economic inequality and corruption in government.

George's ideas and legacy continue to be debated and studied to this day. His work has influenced figures as diverse as Winston Churchill, Sun Yat-sen, and Martin Luther King Jr.

Gliese 1

Gliese 1 is a red dwarf in the constellation Sculptor, which is found in the southern celestial hemisphere. It is one of the closest stars to the Sun, at a distance of 14.2 light years. Because of its closeness to the Earth it is a frequent object of study and much is known about its physical properties and composition. However, with an apparent magnitude of about 8.6 it is too faint to be seen with the naked eye.

Peak Forest Canal

The Peak Forest Canal is a narrow (7-foot gauge) canal in northern England. It is 14.8 miles (23.8 km) long. There is a flight of 16 locks that raise the canal by 209 feet (64 m) over the course of 1 mile. It was opened in 1800.

It goes from Dukinfield in Tameside, where it joins the Ashton Canal and crosses the River Goyt at Marple where it meets the Macclesfield Canal. It goes on to the Bugsworth Basin in Derbyshire. The Peak Forest Tramway, which was 6 miles (9.7 km) long was used to bring limestone down from the quarries. There is a short branch to the centre of Whaley Bridge.

By the early 1960s it was in a very poor state but it has been restored.

Lock (water navigation)

A lock is a way of raising and lowering boats and ships between stretches of water of different levels on rivers and canals. There is a fixed chamber where the water level can be raised and lowered. 

A pound lock, the most common sort, has a chamber with gates at both ends that control the level of water. They were first used in China during the Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD). On rivers locks were built from turf. Most of them have been rebuilt in brick or stone. 

All pound locks have three elements:

Hormone replacement therapy

Hormone replacement therapy, also known as menopausal hormone therapy or postmenopausal hormone therapy, is a form of hormone therapy used to treat symptoms of the female menopause. Estrogens and progesterones are the main drugs used. Evidence shows that there are health benefits but there can be side effects.


Cosmic time

Cosmic time, or cosmological time, is the time coordinate commonly used in the Big Bang models of physical cosmology. Such time coordinate may be defined for a homogeneous, expanding universe so that the universe has the same density everywhere at each moment in time (the fact that this is possible means that the universe is, by definition, homogeneous). The clocks measuring cosmic time should move along the Hubble flow.

Cosmic time formula_1 is a measure of time by a physical clock with zero peculiar velocity (weird speed) without matter over-/under-densities (to prevent time expanding due to relativistic effects or confusions caused by expansion of the universe). Unlike other measures of time such as temperature, redshift, particle horizon, or Hubble horizon, the cosmic time (similar and combining in a way to make something better to the comoving coordinates) is blind to the expansion of the universe.

There are two main ways for establishing a reference point for the cosmic time. The most easy way is to take the present time as the cosmic reference point (sometimes referred to as the "lookback time").

In a different way, the Big Bang may be taken as reference to define formula_1 as the age of the universe, also known as time since the big bang. The current physical cosmology estimates the present age as 13.8 billion years. The formula_3 doesn't necessarily have to go along with a physical event (such as the cosmological singularity) but rather it refers to the point at which the scale factor would dissappear for a standard cosmological model such as Lambda-CDM model. For instance, in the case of inflation, In other words a non-standard cosmology, the hypothetical moment of big bang is still decided using the test result cosmological models which may happen at the same time as the end of the inflationary epoch. For technical purposes, ideas such as the average temperature of the universe (in units of eV) or the particle horizon are used when the early universe is the goal of a study since understanding the interaction among particles is more important and related than their time coordinate or age.

Cosmic time is the standard time coordinate for specifying the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker solutions of Einstein field equations.

Lactulose

Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide (a special kind of sugar). It can be obtained from Lactose, at high temperatures. When milk is treated using heat, for example with pasteurization, some Lactulose will be result as well. Friedrich Petuely (1922-94) discovered that Lactulose also has properties that are useful for medical treatments: It is beneficial to the gut flora of infants. In larger quantities, in adults, it acts as a laxative. In the gut, Lactrulose favors the growth of bacteria that can process lactose.

Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe

Virginia Eliza Poe (née Clemm; August 15, 1822 January 30, 1847) was an American poetess who was the spouse (wife) of Edgar Allan Poe. She was the poetess of only a single poem. They were first cousins. They first met in 1829. She was seven at the time. 
Virginia Clemm was born in 1822 to parents William Clemm and his spouse (wife) Maria Poe. Virginia's father William died when she was still little. 

In 1829, when Virginia's first cousin Edgar Allan Poe, the infamous American poet, fell into poverty he moved into his aunt's house, where he met Virginia, then seven years old. Over the years, Edgar liked Virginia. He decided that he wanted to marry her in the summer of 1835, when she was 13, and he was 26. (This is only known through letters he wrote to his aunt Maria). Even though it habeen disputed when exactly when Edgar and Virginia got married (due to lack of records), it is known that they were already married shortly before Virginia turned 14. This means Edgar and Virginia got married in either 1835 or 1836.

Virginia's husband Edgar realized she had great talent in singing and encouraged her to sing songs. 

In 1841, Virginia began to cough frequently, especially while she sung songs to her husband and mother. 
Despite that, her husband Edgar, encouraged her to continue singing songs. The coughing continued for a while. 

By the middle of January 1842, while Virginia was singing, she coughed out some of her blood. At first, Edgar was very little concerned, but when the coughing got worse and more blood came out over time, Edgar got really concerned. Virginia was taken to a physician who diagnosed her with having tuberculosis. Upon hearing this, Edgar later moved her to the countryside hoping the nature over there would ease Virginia's pain. Virginia stayed in the countryside for around seven months, only to become weaker and much more ill during this time. On or around the 29th of January 1847, Virginia was so weak and ill that she was starting to die. 

Virginia died the next day on the 30th of January 1847, at the age of 24. 

Her body was buried in the nearby cemetery.

The Sorrows of Young Werther

The Sorrows of Young Werther (German: "Die Leiden des jungen Werthers" )is one of the most famous book of German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

His style that pursuing the joy and sorrow of young people was epochal at the time when there was a lot of French aristocratic literature.It published in 1774.It was based on his experience．

New York City (painting)

New York City is a painting by Piet Mondrian. The painting was completed in 1942. It used to be known as New York City I It is on display in the Musée National d'Art Moderne at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, France.

There is an unfinished version of the work, called New York City I. It has strips of paper tape, which the artist could re-arrange to try what different designs would look like. The unfinished version is shown at the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen in Düsseldorf, Germany. In 2022, people discovered that the artwork had been hanging upside down for years. To avoid damaging the painting, its orientation was not changed.

"The Guardian" states that the painting was first shown at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City in 1945. The Netherlands Institute for Art History has no record of this exhibition, and says that the painting was first shown at the Valentine Gallery in New York City in 1946 for about three weeks. The estate of Piet Mondrian in New York City owned the painting until they sold it to the city's Sidney Janis Gallery in 1958. It was then briefly in the hands of Galerie Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland, in 1980. Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen bought it later that same year.

Art historian Susanne Meyer-Büser announced in October 2022 that the artwork had been displayed upside down at the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen for decades. The other artwork "New York City" has a denser group of lines at the top of the painting, which were said to represent the sky, while "New York City I" was displayed with those lines at the bottom. A picture of the painting in the artist's studio also showed the painting with the denser lines at the top. There is no signature on the canvas. This might have added to the confusion. Mondrian had not signed the work, possibly because it was unfinished.

After the issue was pointed out, a number of people stated that the error was obvious. Because the work is very fragile, the museum decided to keep the painting oriented upside down. Changing the orientation of the painting might have caused parts of it to disintegrate; the adhesive used has deteriorated, some of the tapes are "hanging by a thread".

Online dating

Online dating is using websites or special applivations to find like-minded users to connect and interact with each other. People can find romantic relationships, or partners for sex on such platforms. Most often, people who are single use these platforms.

Commonly, peole create an account, and add details to their profile. The platform then allows them to find other people with similar profiles. When they are searching, people could then filter the results to only include other people who are close, or who are in a certain age range. 

Depending on the site, a user might be able to send a message to another user, or to do a voice call (often using VOIP). 

These sites also have a number of problems:


Sociologists have also pointed out other problems:


Koshi Province (Nepal)

Koshi Province (Nepali: कोशी प्रदेश),is one of the seven federal provinces of Nepal. It was established in 2015 by the current constitution of Nepal. It was originally called Province No. 1. On March 1, 2023, it was renamed after the Kosi River. The capital city is Biratnagar.

The province is bordered by the Tibet of China to the north, the Indian states of Sikkim and West Bengal to the east, and Bihar to the south, and Bagmati Province and Madhesh Province to the west. According to the 2021 Nepal census, there are around 5 million people in the province, with a population density of 190 per square kilometre. As per the 2011 Nepal census the province had around 4.5 million people.

Midcourse Space Experiment

The Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) is a Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) satellite experiment (unmanned space mission) to map bright infrared sources in space. MSX offered the first system demonstration of technology in space to identify and track ballistic missiles during their midcourse flight phase.

On 24 April 1996, the BMDO launched the MSX satellite on a Delta II booster from Vandenberg AFB, California. MSX was placed in a sun-synchronous orbit at 898 km and an inclination of 99.16 degrees. MSX's mission was to gather data in three spectral bands (long wavelength infrared, visible, and ultraviolet).

From 13 May 1998, MSX became a giving sensor to the Space Surveillance Network.

Lottie Williams was exercising in a park in Tulsa on January 22, 1997, when she was hit in the shoulder by a piece of blackened metallic material. U.S., Space Command confirmed that a used Delta II rocket from the April 1996 launch of the Midcourse Space Experiment had crashed into the atmosphere 30 minutes earlier. The object tapped her on the shoulder and fell off harmlessly onto the ground. Williams collected the item and NASA tests later showed that the piece was matching up with the materials of the rocket, and Nicholas Johnson, the agency's chief scientist for orbital debris, believes that she was in fact hit by a piece of the rocket.

Operational from 1996 to 1997, MSX mapped the galactic plane and areas either missed or identified as especially bright by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) at wavelengths of 4.29 μm, 4.35 μm, 8.28 μm, 12.13 μm, 14.65 μm, and 21.3 μm.

It carried the 33-cm SPIRIT III infrared telescope and interferometer–spectrometer with solid hydrogen-cooled five line-scanned infrared focal plane arrays (rows).
Calibration of MSX created a challenge for designers of the experiment, as baselines (measures of what occurs naturally) did not exist for the bands it would be observing under. Engineers solved the problem by having MSX fire projectiles of known composition in front of the detector, and calibrating the instruments to the known black-body curves of the objects. The MSX calibration serves as the basis for other satellites working in the same wavelength range, including AKARI (2006-2011) and the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST).

MSX data is now available in the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) given by NASA's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC). Group efforts between the Air Force Research Laboratory and IPAC has resulted in an archive containing images for about 15 percent of the sky, including the whole Galactic Plane, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and areas of the sky missed by IRAS.

The adult male frog is about 26.6-33.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 30.7 to 39.8 mm long. There is no webbed skin on the front feet and only a small amount of webbed skin on the back feet. The skin on the frog's back is brown or gray-brown in color, with black spots.

Line of succession to the Liechtensteiner throne

Line of succession to the Bhutanese throne

The line of succession to the throne of Bhutan is based on the constitution of Bhutan.

The list is made up of the nearest family of the current monarch. The actual line of succession may be much longer as there could be other legitimate descendants of King Ugyen Wangchuck.

The legitimate descendants of King Ugyen Wangchuck are presently entitled to succeed. If a king dies leaving a pregnant wife, the unborn child will automatically assume a place in the line of succession if there is no male heir. A person loses his or her succession rights if he or she marries a person who is not a natural born Bhutanese citizen.

Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway

Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway (born 3 December 2005) is the younger child of Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit. He is third in line to succeed his grandfather King Harald V, after his father and elder sister, Princess Ingrid Alexandra.

Prince Sverre Magnus was born on 3 December 2005 at The National Hospital the Oslo University Hospital in Oslo, where his sister Princess Ingrid Alexandra had been born a year earlier.

The Constitution of Norway was changed in 1990 to introduce full primogeniture, ensuring that the crown would pass to the eldest child regardless of sex but keeping the Crown Prince ahead of his elder sister, Princess Märtha Louise. This change applied for the first time to the children of the Crown Prince, meaning that Sverre Magnus would not rank above his elder sister, as would have happened under the older constitutional rules. Sverre Magnus is third in the line of succession to the Norwegian throne following his sister. He is a member of the Royal Family but not of the Royal House, which includes only his grandparents, parents, and sister.



Prince Sverre Magnus is styled as "His Highness" Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway, as opposed to his sister, who is styled as "Her Royal Highness".


Håkøya

Håkøya is an island in Tromsø Municipality, Norway. It's a island located in between two other islands called Kvaløya and Tromsøya. It's close to a town called Eidkjosen and a city called Tromsø.

Most of the trees are on the higher parts of the island. People mostly live near the water, and there are houses, small holiday homes, and farms.

There is a bridge that connects Håkøya to Kvaløya called Håkøybrua. The bridge used to be made of wood, but now it's made of steel and concrete.

Princess Märtha of Sweden (Märtha Sofia Lovisa Dagmar Thyra; 28 March 1901 – 5 April 1954) was Crown Princess of Norway as the wife of the future King Olav V from 1929 until her death in 1954. The current King Harald V is her only son. 

Princess Märtha was also a sister of Queen Astrid of Belgium, and a maternal aunt of Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg, King Baudouin of Belgium and King Albert II of Belgium.

Märtha was born at her parents' home of Arvfurstens Palats in Stockholm on 28 March 1901, the second child of Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Västergötland, and his wife Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. Her father was the younger brother of King Gustav V of Sweden (making her a first cousin twice removed of the present King of Sweden) and her mother was the younger sister of King Christian X of Denmark and of King Haakon VII of Norway.

Märtha had an elder sister, Princess Margaretha of Denmark, a younger sister, Queen Astrid of the Belgians, and a younger brother, Prince Carl Bernadotte. Märtha grew up to be much more confident and outgoing and so the daughter most admired by her mother.

As a child, Märtha was taught at home by private tutors and completed courses in childcare and first aid. She and her sisters were occasionally seen shopping unaccompanied on the streets of Stockholm.

During the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Princess Märtha of Sweden became engaged to her first and second cousin, Prince Olav, only son and heir apparent of her uncle the King of Norway and grandson of her grandfather King Frederick VIII of Denmark's younger sister. News of the engagement was very well received. An excellent match for strengthening royal ties, it was also clearly a match based on love. Initially, her younger sister, Astrid, was expected to marry Olav, being younger than Olav by two years, while Märtha was two years older. Astrid was also considered more beautiful, but she instead married the future King of the Belgians Leopold III.

Following a year-long engagement, she married Crown Prince Olav in Oslo Cathedral on 21 March 1929. Märtha's was the first royal wedding in Norway in 340 years. The marriage is widely believed to have been a success due in large part to their genuine mutual love. They had three children: Ragnhild (1930–2012); Astrid (b. 1932); and the much awaited heir, Harald (b. 1937).

Crown Princess Märtha soon became a popular and respected member of the royal family, later performing a range of official engagements. She also gave many speeches, unusual for royal females in that era.

Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha of Norway resided at the country estate of Skaugum, which was a wedding gift from Baron Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg. When the main house at Skaugum was destroyed by fire in 1930, the Crown Princess was actively involved in its rebuilding.

Tragedy struck Crown Princess Märtha in 1935 when her sister Queen Astrid of the Belgians was killed in a car crash. The two sisters had been very close. Later King Olav said that it took his wife more than ten years to come to terms with her sister's death, and he did not think that she ever really got over it. Märtha and elder sister Margaretha became a great support for Astrid's children in Belgium.

In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the Crown Prince and Princess visited the United States. The couple befriended President Franklin Roosevelt and his wife, Eleanor.

In 1938 upon the death of her mother-in-law, Queen Maud, Crown Princess Märtha became the royal Norwegian court's senior lady.

Crown Princess Märtha contributed greatly towards Norway mobilizing for self-defence by making a public announcement on 26 January 1940 when she encouraged Norwegian women to participate in the mobilization work. During the flight from the German invasion in 9–10 April 1940, the Norwegian government decided that the Crown Princess and her children were to flee across the border to her native Sweden while her husband and father-in-law remained. When they arrived at the Swedish border, they were first denied entry because they could not provide passports; she then instructed her driver to run through the border gate, thus gaining entry into her native Sweden.

In Sweden she stayed at first at a tourist hotel in Sälen, before travelling on to Stockholm where her parents and relatives lived. Her presence in Sweden became problematic where some considered her presence to put Sweden's neutrality in jeopardy. President Roosevelt then offered her a personal invitation to the United States. Her uncle, King Gustav V of Sweden, telegraphed her father-in-law King Haakon and advised against the trip, but Märtha insisted on accepting the invitation. Roosevelt sent the US Army transport to the then Finnish port city of Petsamo to pick her up. In the U.S., she and her children initially stayed at the White House. Crown Prince Olav, however, accompanied his father to the United Kingdom with the Norwegian government-in-exile. Thus the Norwegian royal couple, like many other couples during that time, were separated for much of the war.
In August 1941, Crown Princess Märtha traveled with President Roosevelt aboard the presidential yacht, , and sailed to Newfoundland and the Atlantic Charter meetings with Winston Churchill.

Princess Märtha spent much of World War II in the United States, where she worked tirelessly to keep up support for Norway among the American public and government.

When she returned to Norway following the war in 1945, Princess Märtha received a hero's welcome and was referred to as "Mother of the Nation". She wholly embraced her role as Crown Princess of Norway and made tremendous efforts towards ensuring the stability and well-being of all Norwegians.

As King Haakon’s health declined, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess assumed a growing number of official engagements. The Crown Princess became involved in many official tasks, and even made the annual New Year’s Eve speeches in 1946 and 1950.
After the war, Crown Princess Märtha suffered from poor health.

After a long period of ill-health, Märtha died of cancer at The National Hospital in Oslo on 5 April 1954 and was buried at Akershus Castle.

Her death came at the time her elder daughter Princess Ragnhild was expecting her first child and just over three years before her husband ascended the throne as King.

A 970,000 km² area in Antarctica is named Princess Martha Coast in her honor.

A statue of the princess, created by was erected outside the Norwegian embassy in Washington, D.C. in 2005. In 2007, a replica of the statue was erected in the courtyard of the Royal Palace in Oslo. A third replica was erected outside The Norwegian Seamen`s Church in Stockholm, Sweden, unveiled by her daughter, Princess Astrid in 2008. This church, "Kronprinsesse Märthas kirke" is named after her.

Crown Princess Märtha’s Memorial Fund is a charitable trust administered by the Norwegian Crown. The Crown Princess's youngest daughter, Princess Astrid, serves as chairperson. Initially established as "Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Märtha’s Fund" on 1 April 1929, the fund "is to provide financial support to social and humanitarian initiatives carried out by non-governmental organizations." In 2005, the Fund had assets of approximately 28 million Norwegian krone (NOK), and issued grants totaling about 1.5 million NOK for roughly 300 recipients.

Her son King Harald V named his daughter Princess Märtha Louise after her grandmother.

The popular Swedish layer Princess cake was named for Märtha and her two sisters when they were children.

The ship , launched in 1929, was named after her. This ship which helped to save hundreds of passengers from the sinking German cruise ship "Dresden" in 1934 has, since 2000, been used as a hotel ship in Stockholm.

Märtha is depicted in the historical docudrama television miniseries, "Atlantic Crossing," a co-production of Cinenord and the state broadcaster, NRK.

All Saints Roman Catholic School, York

The All Saints Roman Catholic School, in Yorkshire, England, is made up of two schools in York. It has been said to be the best Catholic school in the North. The Upper School is for years 10-13 and contains the Sixth Form. The Lower Site is for years 7-9. The School was created in 1686. As it is the only Catholic school in the city of York, it is very important for Catholic teachings in the city.

All Saints is primarily a school for Catholic children from York and Yorkshire. However, it does accept students from other faiths and belief backgrounds.

When All Saints first opened in 1686, it was the first Catholic school to teach girls in Britain.

300 years ago, a group of angry locals threatened to rob the school and its convent, however it is said that Saint Michael appeared on a white horse with a large sword and scared them away.

During the 1800s, an additional building was built.

In 1925, the school became a grammar school.

During the Blitz in 1942, the school was bombed.

During the mid-1970s, the school began admitting boys. It then became a secondary school in 1985. This is also when the upper school building was purchased to accommodate the larger number of students.

The school was set up in 1920 in the original Manor building and stables, which was built in 1850 for Charles Heneage Elsley Esq., J.P. and Recorder of York.

In 1965, a plan was proposed to merge Mill Mount with Nunthorpe Grammar School to become a sixth form college. However, this plan did not succeed, and the site was sold to All Saints RC School.

In 1985 due to discussions on the reorganization of York's Catholic schools, St George's Secondary school closed. The school was merged into All Saints RC School, instead.

There have been three headteachers since 1985:


All Saints is the only Catholic secondary school in the area, it accepts students from all over Yorkshire. The school has links with English Martyrs Church, which is located 300 meters from the upper site. Every year, the whole school celebrates All Saints Day in the Minster.

The school has recently wanted to relocate to meet the demands of all its students, so in March 2022, local MP Rachael Maskell raised the subject of the school building's in the House of Commons. After this, the school was granted some money as part of the school rebuilding programme.

In 2022, 70% of pupils achieved a strong pass or above in GCSE English and Maths.

Almost 50% of the sixth forms' A level grades were at A* or A.

In November 2022, the school achieved the fifth position in northern schools ranking. It also managed first place in the Northern Comprehensive School, northern Catholic School and York Secondary School categories.

With the exception of two cities, the tickets for the concerts were sold only on , which is owned by Live Nation Entertainment.

Municipal boroughs were a type of local government district which existed in England and Wales between 1835 and 1974, in Northern Ireland from 1840 to 1973 and in the Republic of Ireland from 1840 to 2002. There were similar structures in Scotland from 1833 to 1975.

There were boroughs in England and Wales since the middle ages. In 1833 a Royal Commission investigated them. 263 towns in England and Wales had some form of corporation. The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed the government of towns. It set up municipal boroughs. They each had an elected town council, with a mayor, aldermen and councillors. To vote in the elections voters had to own property in the area. The councillors were directly elected for a three-year term, If there were more than 6,000 people the area was divided into wards with separate elections held in each ward each year. There were then 178 municipal boroughs. 

The smaller boroughs which had not been reformed were mostly abolished in the 1880s by the Municipal Corporations Act 1883, except for the City of London Corporation. 

The Local Government Act 1888 created county councils across England and Wales. Boroughs were divided into two sorts, with some becoming county boroughs which were entirely self-governing and independent from county councils.

There were over 200 municipal boroughs in 1974 when they were abolished by the Local Government Act 1972. In England, they were replaced by metropolitan or non-metropolitan districts and in Wales by districts.

Similar things happened in Ireland under British rule. The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 set up the six largest cities - Belfast, Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Derry and Waterford as county boroughs.

Taylor Swift decided to be a country singer when she watched a movie about Faith Hill. She wanted to move to Nashville, Tennessee because it is known as the home of country music.

She started making some songs to see if record labels would like them. She eventually joined Big Machine Records. She moved to Hendersonville, Tennessee because it is close to Nashville. She was one of the first people to be in Big Machine Records.

She was wrong, however, and "Taylor Swift" kept selling a similar amount each week. By November 2007, the album had sold over a million copies.

At its highest, "Taylor Swift" was at number 14 on the Canadian Albums Chart and was certified Platinum by Music Canada (MC).

Cars in North Korea

The automotive industry in North Korea is a branch of the national economy, with much lower production than the automotive industry in South Korea. In North Korea, motor vehicle production is focused on military and industrial goals, including construction; few private citizens own cars. It is estimated that only about 2% of the population own cars. The majority of North Koreans are not able to afford a car, and even if they could, gasoline is rationed and hard to come by. There are very few roads and even fewer cars, so even those who do have cars don’t have much opportunity to use them.

The North Korean automobile industry had its origins during the Soviet era, and the DPRK began motor-vehicle production with licenses obtained from the USSR. North Korea’s first domestically produced automobiles were copies of Soviet designs, such as the GAZ-51 midi-truck, the GAZ 69 off-road four-wheel drive vehicle, and the GAZ-M20 Pobeda passenger car. The Sungri Motor Plant in Tokchon has been North Korea’s first and largest motor vehicle plant since 1950, producing urban and off-road passenger cars and small, medium, and heavy cargo, haulage, construction, and off-road trucks and buses under the names Sungri and Jaju, among others. It was the most capable plant of the North Korean automotive industry before being surpassed by Pyeonghwa Motors. Pyeonghwa Motors in Nampo is an auto manufacturing and retailing joint venture between South Korea’s Pyeonghwa Motors and the North Korea’s Ryonbong General Corp. Pyeonghwa Motors products are sold under the names Hwiparam, Bbeokgugi (Peokkugi) and Zunma: small and luxury cars, minivans, SUVs and pick-up trucks under license. However, most North Koreans are unable to own cars.

Robert Motherwell

Robert Motherwell (January 24, 1915 – July 16, 1991) was an American artist. He was an important painter in the abstract expressionist movement.

Motherwell was born in Aberdeen, Washington in 1915. When he was 11 years old, he was given money to study art. In 1932 he studied painting at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco. After getting a B. A. from Stanford University in 1937, he began to study philosophy at Harvard University. He studied in Europe for a year. He had his first art show in Paris in 1939. 

Back in New York, he was friends with artists William Baziotes, Willem de Kooning, Hans Hofmann, and Jackson Pollock. He was married to the painter Helen Frankenthaler from 1958 until 1971.

Motherwell died in 1991, at Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

Ward (electoral subdivision)

A ward is a local government area, mostly used for elections.

In some countries, wards are given names. It is common in the United States for wards to simply be numbered. In Ireland they are called electoral divisions. In Australia, some local government areas (LGAs) have wards; some of them are numbered and others have names. Most Australian wards elect multiple members, but some (such as those of the Brisbane City Council) elect only one member per ward.

The word "ward" seems have first been used in the City of London in the the 11th century. There are now 25 wards there, all very small.

In Australia, some local government areas (LGAs) have wards. Most of these are multi-member wards, but some are single-member wards. Some wards are named, while others are numbered. Most LGAs that have wards are in cities.

The Brisbane City Council, the council that governs the City of Brisbane (the LGA representing most of Brisbane) but acting rather like a state parliament, has 26 single-member wards. These wards elect 26 of the 27 councillors; the remaining seat is held by the Lord Mayor who is directly elected.

The Local Government Boundary Commissions change the wards quite often, especially in cities, to try and keep the numbers fair. This can make it hard to keep track of statistics over time.

Võro language

Võro language is a Finno-Ugric language spoken primarily in the Võru County of southeastern Estonia. It is also known as Võro kiil, Võru language, or Seto-Võro language. With an estimated 75,000 speakers, Võro language is recognized as a minority language in Estonia, and it has been the subject of ongoing efforts to promote its use and preserve its cultural heritage.

The Võro language has a complex history, with roots that can be traced back to the Finno-Ugric language family, which includes other languages spoken in northern and eastern Europe. Throughout its history, the Võro language has evolved and changed, influenced by cultural and linguistic factors from the region. Today, it is recognized as an important regional language of Estonia, with its own distinct grammar, vocabulary, and cultural identity.

One of the defining features of the Võro language is its distinctive accent and pronunciation. Võro language has a rich set of vowels and consonants, and its intonation patterns and stress placement are unique compared to other languages. The language also has a rich vocabulary, with many words borrowed from neighboring languages such as Latvian and Russian, as well as its own unique terminology for cultural concepts and traditional practices.

In terms of grammar, Võro language has a complex system of cases, with several different cases used to denote the subject, object, and other grammatical elements in a sentence. The language also has a rich system of verb conjugation and agreement, with different verb forms used to indicate tense, aspect, and mood.

The Võro language has several dialects, which can vary in their pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. Some of the main dialects include Central Võro, Haanja Võro, Seto-Võro, and Leelo Võro. Despite these differences, however, speakers of different dialects can usually understand each other without too much difficulty.

Despite being a minority language, the Võro language has played an important role in Estonian cultural heritage. The language has been the subject of numerous works of literature, including poetry, fiction, and drama, and there are many traditional songs and dances that are performed in Võro language. Efforts have been made to promote the use of the language, including the establishment of the Võro Institute in 1995, which is dedicated to the study and preservation of Võro language and culture. In addition, Võro language is taught in some schools in the Võru County, and there are cultural events and festivals that celebrate the language and its heritage.

In conclusion, Võro language is a unique and important part of Estonia's cultural heritage, with its own distinctive grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. Despite being a minority language, it has played a significant role in Estonian cultural identity and continues to be the focus of efforts to promote its use and preserve its cultural heritage.

During the 18th century, Estonia was part of the Swedish Empire, and the Võru County was located on the eastern border of the empire. The region was sparsely populated, with small villages and farms scattered throughout the countryside. The economy was largely based on agriculture and forestry, with some trade and handicrafts also present.

Given the isolation and relative poverty of the region, it is likely that the Võro language was still very much a rural and traditional language during the 18th century. It would have been spoken primarily by the peasant class, who made up the majority of the population. The language would have been transmitted orally from generation to generation, with little or no formal education in the language.

One of the defining features of the Võro language is its rich set of vowel sounds and its complex system of cases. It is likely that these features were already present in the language during the 18th century, although they may have been somewhat different from their modern forms. The language would also have had a distinct vocabulary, with many words related to traditional agricultural practices, crafts, and other aspects of rural life.

During the 18th century, there were few opportunities for literary expression in the Võro language. It is possible that some traditional songs, poems, and stories were passed down orally, but these would have been largely unknown outside of the local community. It was not until the 19th and 20th centuries that the Võro language began to be used in written form, as part of a wider movement to promote the use and preservation of minority languages.

In conclusion, while there is little direct information available on the Võro language in the 18th century, it is likely that the language was still a rural and traditional language, spoken primarily by the peasant class. Its grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation would have been different from their modern forms, but the language would have had many of the same distinctive features that it has today.

The Võro language has a rich and diverse set of dialects, reflecting the language's long history and the many influences that have shaped it over time. These dialects are typically associated with specific regions within the historical Võrumaa area, and can vary significantly in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.

One of the most distinctive dialects of Võro is Seto, which is spoken in southeastern Estonia and southwestern Russia. Seto has been recognized as a separate language by some linguists, and is notable for its use of a unique writing system known as the "Old Orthography." Other dialects of Võro include Mulgi, spoken in the Mulgimaa region, and Karula, spoken in the Karula National Park area.

Despite the regional variation of the dialects, speakers of Võro can generally understand one another, and there is a strong sense of linguistic unity among the Võro community. However, the dialects are not static, and have been subject to change over time due to factors such as migration, social and cultural shifts, and contact with other languages.

Linguists have identified a number of features that distinguish the different Võro dialects. For example, the Seto dialect is known for its use of the velar fricative /x/ in place of the standard Võro /h/, while the Mulgi dialect is known for its use of the sound /ɨ/ in place of the standard Võro /i/.

Despite the importance of dialect variation within the Võro language, efforts have been made to promote a standard written form of the language, known as "Võro kiil". This standard form is based on the central dialect of Võru, and is used in written materials such as books, newspapers, and online publications. However, many speakers of Võro continue to use their own regional dialect in everyday conversation, and there is a strong sense of pride in the diversity of dialects that make up this unique and vibrant language community.
Great Norwegian Encyclopedia

The Great Norwegian Encyclopedia or Store Norske Leksikon (SNL) is an online encyclopedia in Norwegian. It is one of the most popular Norwegian websites with over two million visitors each month. SNL was created in 1978 when two publishing houses, Aschehoug and Gyldendal, merged their encyclopedias. Before 1978, they had published their own encyclopedias. The online version of SNL was launched in 2000 and became free to use in 2009. In 2010, Kunnskapsforlaget, the company that owned SNL, announced that they would close the online encyclopedia due to lack of funds. In 2011, two groups called Fritt Ord and Sparebankstiftelsen DNB bought the encyclopedia. In 2014, they made an association with members from universities and non-profit groups. In 2016, they hired a new chief editor, Erik Bolstad.

Platymantis diesmosi

The Mount Malinao forest frog ("Platymantis diesmosi") is a frog. It lives in the Philippines on Luzon Island. People have seen it in the forest between 900 and 1160 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 28.3-39.1 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog isabout 49.8-52.7 mm long. Unlike other frogs in "Platymantis", it does not climb trees much. Instead it lives on the ground. It does have disks on its toes for climbing, but they are smaller than the disks of other frogs in "Platymantis". This frog is dark brown in color with a white mark between its eyes. The tops of its legs are lighter brown with black marks. The iris of the eye is gold in color on top and darker gold on the bottom.

This frog lives in the place where water flows into the Tiwi River. This is where the people in the town of Tiwi get their drinking water. This means that the frog and the people need the same water to be clean.

This frog is in danger of dying out. This is because humans change the places where the frog lives. They build farms and cut down trees so animals can eat grass.

She went to high school at Dowling Catholic High School in West Des Moines, Iowa. Many colleges aimed to get her to play for their women's basketball program. Clark chose to state in her home state and play for the Hawkeyes. 

Clark led Division I in scoring as a freshman, sharing Freshman of the Year honors and being named an All-American. She again led Division I in scoring as a sophomore, but also led in assists, being the first to lead in both in a single season. For her second season, she was named a unanimous All-American. In her junior season at Iowa, she led the Hawkeyes to a national championship game appearance for the first time in the school's history. She was again named a Unanimous All-American and was named the Player of the Year by many media publications.

Clark began her freshman season at Iowa as the team's starting point guard. She played her first game on November 25, 2020 against Northern Iowa, which ended in a 96–81 win for the Hawkeyes. In the win, she scored 27 points and also had eight rebounds and four assists. In her next game, she posted her first career double-double with 30 points and 13 assists in a win over Drake. On December 22, she posted her first career triple-double as Iowa beat Western Illinois. Clark shot the ball at a low percentage, but still scored 13 points, and had 13 rebounds and 10 assists. On February 11, 2021 she scored a season-high 39 points in a win against Nebraska. Clark added 10 rebounds and seven assists in the game. She finished the regular season being named the Big Ten Freshman of the Year and a unanimous first-team All-Big Ten selection.

Clark and Iowa finished as the runners-up of the Big Ten Tournament. In the second round of the NCAA Division I women's tournament, Clark scored 35 points and made 6 three-pointers in a win against Kentucky. Both were schools records in tournament play. With the win, Iowa reached the Sweet 16 round. In that round, Clark scored 21 points as Iowa lost to UConn 92–72.

At the end of the season, the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) named her a first-team All-American. The Associated Press (AP) also named her as a second-team All-American. Clark was also named to the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) Coaches' All-America team. She became the first freshman to win the Dawn Staley Award, which is given to Division I's best point guard. Additionally, Clark and UConn's Paige Bueckers were named the WBCA Co-Freshmen of the Year. The two also shared that year's Tamika Catchings Award, the USBWA's Freshman of the Year honor. Clark finished her freshman season averaging 26.6 points, 7.1 assists, and 5.9 rebounds per game (rpg). Her 26.6 points per game (ppg) led Division I women's basketball in scoring and also set an Iowa freshman record.

Clark began her second season at Iowa with 26 points, eight rebounds, and six assists in a 93–50 win against New Hampshire. On January 2, 2022, Clark scored 44 points in a big 93–56 win over Evansville. During the game, she reached 1,000 career points, setting a Big Ten women's record as the fastest player to do so. Later in January, she had two triple-doubles in a row in wins over Nebraska and Minnesota. She scored 30 points in both games, becoming the first NCAA Division I player in either men's or women's basketball to post two 30-point triple-doubles in a row. Then on January 25, she had 18 assists in a win against Penn State. This set an an Iowa record and tied the Big Ten Conference record for assists in a single game. On February 6, she scored her career high of 46 points, but Iowa lost to Michigan. Clark was named the Big Ten Conference's Player of the Year by coaches and media. She also was named a unanimous All-Big Ten player.

Clark helped Iowa win the Big Ten conference tournament and was named the tournament's most outstanding player (MOP). Iowa was expected to make a run in the NCAA tournament but Creighton upset the Hawkeyes in the second round. Clark had a season-low 15 points against Creighton and shot poorly, making only 4-of-19 attempts.

For her performance in her second season, Clark was named a unanimous All-American. Clark also won the Dawn Staley Award again, becoming the first player to win it twice and in back-to-back seasons. Clark also won the Nancy Lieberman Award, another award given to Division I's top point guard. Clark finished the season averaging 27 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists per game (apg). She led Division I in ppg and apg, becoming the first player to do so.

During the preseason of her junior year, basketball coaches and media set high expectations of Clark. She was unanimously picked to be on the AP preseason All-America team. Early into the season, Clark suffered an ankle injury with just a few seconds left in a game against Kansas State. The Hawkeyes lost that game 83–84. Despite the injury, Clark played the next game to help the Hawkeyes win against Belmont. On December 1, she scored her season-high of 45 points, but Iowa lost to NC State.

Inauguration of Benjamin Harrison

The inauguration of Benjamin Harrison as the 23rd president of the United States happened on March 4, 1889. It was the start of the only term of Benjamin Harrison as president and Levi P. Morton as vice president.

A public ceremony happened on the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The event was the 26th presidential inauguration. Chief Justice Melville Fuller administered the oath of office to Harrison. John James Ingalls administered the vice presidential oath of office to Morton.

The inauguration happened during a rainstorm in Washington D.C. Harrison's speech was short, and he spoke about the growth of the United States due to education and religion. He also told the states that harvested cotton and did mining to use the industrial technology the eastern part of the United States had. Harrison also talked about the territories to become US states, and for a raise in pension for veterans. He also talked about the Monroe Doctrine, as well as wanting a better and more modern Navy.

John Philip Sousa's band played at the Inaugural Ball. After the inauguration, Harrison stated his desire for an office separate from the White House, saying "There is only a door – one that is never locked – between the president's office and what are not very accurately called his private apartments. There should be an executive office building, not too far away, but wholly distinct from the dwelling house. For everyone else in the public service there is an unroofed space between the bedroom and the desk."


Vasilissa (child martyr)

Vasilissa, Holy Martyr (300309) was a small child when martyred, suffering in Nicomedia not long after the death of Anthimus. According to the Russian Orthodox tradition, the torturers covered her whole body with wounds, but she remained faithful to Christ. She was also tortured with fire and was before wild beasts, yet remained unscathed. Her torturer, Alexander, seeing those wonders, repented and became a Christian. Vasilissa went out into a field, fell on her knees and prayed to God, thanking Him for her endurance under torture, and, while thus praying, gave her soul into God's hands. 
She died in 309 in Nicomedia.

Countryliner

Countryliner was a bus company in Uckfield in England. It was big, running more than fifty bus services mostly in Sussex. The company closed on the 18th of January 2013 under a new bus operating licence called SwiftBus Limited that was before that known as the RJB (UK) Limited licence. The main Countryliner company closed on the 8th of October 2012. 
The Countryliner company got involved in a Surrey County Council public inquiry which asked people what they thought about Countryliner. Countryliner was in quite a lot of debt, so they paid it as much of it off to try and stop the company from closing. Sadly, the company got closed because their buses had high M.O.T. failures.
Countryliner's buses went to Sunray Travel when Sunray Travel started to drive service 479 Guildford-Epsom commercially.
Countryliner used a mixture of Plaxton Pointer Dennis Darts, MAN 12.220 MCV Evolutions, Optare Excels, Plaxton Premieres and more for their bus and school services.

Apache Hadoop

Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software tools, that speeds up the processing of very large amounts of data by distributing it to multiple computers.
Its core consists of:

The distributed nature of Hadoop means that processing:

HDFS is also used for other projects such as the Apache NoSQL Wide Column Store, Apache HBase.
Reading and writing to and from disk for each transformation means that Hadoop MapReduce is slower for most pipelines than Apache Spark which uses RAM rather than disk and also runs within the Hadoop ecosystem. Spark may cost more in terms of resources such as memory and CPU.

Available to work alongside HDFS and Hadoop MapReduce are other Apache tools in the Hadoop ecosystem, such as:

Prosecution of Donald Trump in New York

On March 30, 2023, Donald Trump, president of the United States from 2017 to 2021, was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury. It is alleged that he paid hush money to pornographic movie actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 United States presidential election. ("Hush money" is a bribe to maintain secrecy - to prevent bad publicity or to prevent the discovery of a crime.) The "Hush" money was actually apart of an agreement that was meant to be secret, and the money was to make sure that it was agreed upon, not bribing.

Trump became the first former U.S. president to be indicted and to face criminal and felony charges. He was the first president to be arrested since Ulysses S. Grant was arrested in 1872.
In 2021, Alvin Bragg was elected Manhattan District Attorney. In February 2022, the two prosecutors that were leading the investigation of Trump, quit their jobs. Those two - Mark F. Pomerantz and Carey Dunne - said that Bragg was not pursuing charges against Trump aggressively enough.

On April 4, 2023, Trump's motorcade drove him to the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse. As he went into the courthouse, he was arrested. Trump was formally placed under arrest without being handcuffed or having a mugshot taken. Trump came into the courtroom an hour later, and got 34 felony charges of falsifying business records. However, media says that each charge can range from a misdemeanor to a felony. Trump pleaded not guilty to all the charges. After the court hearing, Trump traveled by plane back home to Florida. In the evening, he met with and spoke to a crowd of supporters.

A date for the start of a trial, has been set (as of February 2024).

The indictment has been unsealed and published by New York Supreme Court, but it does not show or reveal the district attorney's specific legal theory behind the case.

Liz Truss lettuce

On 14 October 2022, the British tabloid newspaper the "Daily Star" began a livestream of a head of lettuce next to a framed photograph of Liz Truss, who had just become prime minister of the United Kingdom.

This joke was made in response to an article by "The Economist" that compared the shortness of time of Truss's premiership to the shelf life of a lettuce. The October 2022 United Kingdom government crisis happened just weeks into her term, and many commentators thought that she would resign soon. The lettuce soon became popular for the public. The "Daily Star" had the lettuce on Cameo, allowing users to get a personalized message "by the lettuce" for £13. 

On 18 October 2022, the "Daily Star" added a pair of googly eyes and a blonde wig on the lettuce, followed by fake feet and hands and glasses to make it look like Truss.

Truss announced her resignation as prime minister on 20 October 2022, before the lettuce had expired. After her resignation announcement, an image of the lettuce was projected onto the Palace of Westminster the same day.

It can fine organisations which break the rules. William Hill was fined £19.2million in 2023 for failing to protect its customers from accruing unpayable debts.

Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler

Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler (Margaretha Désirée Victoria; born 31 October 1934), is a Swedish princess. She is the eldest sister of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and also a first cousin of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.

Margaretha was born on 31 October 1934 at Haga Palace in Haga Park, Stockholm, as the first child of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, and his wife, Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. She was born during the reign of her paternal great-grandfather King Gustav V of Sweden. In January 1947, her father died in an airplane crash.

Although the eldest child, as a female, she was never in line to the throne according to the Swedish constitution current at the time. She was educated privately at the Haga Palace and then at the Stockholm dressmaking school, Märthaskolan (Martha School).

She met her future husband, businessman John Ambler, at a dinner party in the United Kingdom in 1963. Their engagement was announced on 28 February 1964. They were married on 30 June 1964, in Gärdslösa Church, on the island of Öland. The Princess wore a wedding gown from the Stockholm couture school, Märthaskolan, where she had previously been a student, and a traditional wedding crown from Öland.

As a result of her unequal marriage, she lost her style of "Royal Highness" and the King gave her the courtesy title of "Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler". Under the Swedish constitution of that time, she, as a woman, and her descendants were not able to inherit the throne. As a result, they still are not.

Ambler and her husband separated in 1994, but never divorced. He died on 31 May 2008.

Margaretha and John Ambler's marriage produced three children: Sybilla (b. 1965), Edward (b. 1966), and James (b. 1969). Her daughter married Baron Henning von Dincklage and has two children, of whom Madeleine Charlotte Margaretha von Dincklage is the goddaughter of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and was a bridesmaid at her wedding.

Jade burial suit

A jade burial suit () is a suit made out of jade. It was used for the burial of Han dynasty princes and princesses.

Jade burial suits were meant for Han dynasty emperors. The emperor can give jade burial suits to members of his family. The jade pieces of the emperor's jade suit are tied together with gold threads. Princes and princesses can only use silver or copper threads. The jade suit of Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan had more than 2498 plates of jade.

The people of the Hemudu and Majiabang cultures buried their dead with jade objects. In the Han dynasty, this became the jade burial suit. Jade suits were mentioned in the "Book of Han" and the "Book of the Later Han". Emperor Wen of Han banned the use of jade suits.

The first jade suits were found in Liu Sheng's tomb.

The Third Wave (experiment)

The Third Wave was an experimental social campaign made by California high school history teacher Ron Jones in 1967. This experiment was meant to explain to the students how the German population could accept the actions of the Nazis during the rise of the Third Reich and the Second World War.

Jones taught his students about Nazi Germany. During his senior level World History class, he found it difficult to explain to his students how the German population could accept the actions of the Nazis. He decided to make a fake social movement as an example of the appeal of fascism. The experiment took place over the course of 5 days (or nine, according to student Sherry Toulsey). Jones started a series of exercises in his classroom mainly focusing on discipline and community. This was intended to model certain traits of the Nazi movement.

The experiment started to get out of control. The movement grew outside of his class and members began to increase in the hundreds. He convinced the students to attend a rally where he claimed that the classroom project was part of a nationwide movement, and that the announcement of a Third Wave presidential candidate would be televised. When the students arrived, they were shown a blank channel. Jones told his students that the movement was an experiment about fascism. He showed his students a short film about the actions of Nazi Germany.

This project was turned into an American film, The Wave, in 1981, and a very praised German film, Die Welle, in 2008.

The experiment started at Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, California, during the first week of April, 1967. Jones was a member of the SDS, sponsor of the Cubberley United Student Movement, and a supporter of the Black Panthers. Jones decided to create this experiment after finding it hard to tell his students how the German people could have ignored the Holocaust. Jones started a movement called "The Third Wave" and told his students that the movement wanted to end democracy. The idea that democracy focuses on individuals was seen as a drawback, and Jones focused this main point of the movement in its motto: "Strength through discipline, strength through community, strength through action, strength through pride."

The experiment was not well documented, being briefly mentioned in two issues of the Cubberley High School student newspaper, "The Cubberley Catamount". Another issue of the paper has a longer description of the experiment when it was finished. Jones wrote a detailed recollection about nine years after. Articles from other authors followed, some featuring an interview with Jones and the students involved.

Prince Hisahito of Akishino

Before his birth, the ongoing Japanese imperial succession debate had resulted in some politicians holding a favorable view on removing agnatic primogeniture imposed by World War II allies on the constitution of Japan. However, once Hisahito was born in 2006 he became next in the line of succession following his father. Hisahito's cousin and Emperor Naruhito's only child Princess Aiko remains at present legally unable to inherit the throne, while debate about the possibility of having future empresses regnant continues.

Hisahito was born at 08:27 JST (23:27 UTC) on 6 September 2006 at Aiiku Hospital, Tokyo. He was delivered by Caesarean section, two weeks early, after complications in the pregnancy.

Hisahito is the only son and youngest child of Fumihito, Crown Prince Akishino, and Kiko, Crown Princess Akishino. He has two older sisters, Mako Komuro and Princess Kako of Akishino. He was first seen in public on 15 September 2006, outside Aiiku Hospital.

Hisahito, the Prince's personal name, chosen by his father, means "serene and virtuous", according to the Imperial Household Agency. An alternative translation is "virtuous, calm, everlasting". 

Hisahito was the first male child born to the Imperial House of Japan since his father in 1965. In January 2007, the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzō Abe, announced that he would drop an earlier proposal to change the Imperial Household Law so as to allow females to inherit the throne. The proposal had been made because the brother and two sons of Emperor Akihito had, at the time, no sons of their own. As a result of Hisahito's birth, it now seems increasingly unlikely that the laws will be changed to allow Hisahito's cousin, Princess Aiko, daughter of the Emperor Naruhito, to become a reigning Empress and thus end the Japanese succession debate. The supporters of changes criticized the current law as it placed a burden on the few aging males old enough to perform royal duties as females left the family.

Stellar-wind bubble

A stellar-wind bubble is a cavity light-years across filled with hot gas blown into the interstellar medium by the high-velocity (many thousand km/s) stellar wind from a single massive star of type O or B. Weaker stellar winds also blow bubble structures, which are also called astrospheres. The heliosphere blown by the solar wind, within which all the major planets of the Solar System are embedded, is a small example of a stellar-wind bubble.

Stellar-wind bubbles have a two-shock structure. The freely-expanding stellar wind hits an inner firing shock, where its kinetic energy is thermalized, producing 10 K, X-ray-emitting plasma. The hot, high-pressure, shocked wind expands, driving a shock into the surrounding interstellar gas. If the surrounding gas is dense enough (number densities formula_1 or so), the swept-up gas radiatively cools far faster than the hot interior, forming a thin, relatively dense shell around the hot, shocked wind.

(Nice Dream)

"(Nice Dream)" is a song by English alternative rock band Radiohead. It is the sixth track of the second studio album "The Bends".

The song was made at Manor Studio under the supervision of producer John Leckie. The latter's intention was to recreate an atmosphere similar to that of the song "My Sweet Lord" by George Harrison, putting it appropriately to the phrases a "good angel", a "garden" and a sense of mysterious belonging.

(Nice Dream) was written in 1992. Ed O'Brien has remembered Thom Yorke playing him a cassette with a demo version of the song in the car in late 1992. On 11 February 1993 Thom along with Jonny Greenwood had premiered the song acoustically at the Studio Café, Disley, UK for "Signal Radio". Towards the end of the tour for Pablo Honey, the lyrics had progressed considerably by the time the song made a few appearances in the band's sets.

The first version with the whole band probably took place on September 3, 1993. 
When the recording sessions began in March 1994 at RAK Studios in London (Nice Dream) it was one of four songs to be recorded first, all of which were possible candidates for the next single (the others being Sulk, The Bends and Killer Cars). 
Finally the song was released on the album The Bends in March 1995.

The song tells the story of a fantasy where the protagonist lives, where he is loved and cared for by the people around him. The narrator doesn't want to get out of this fantasy: he prefers the "nice dream" that lulls him into a sense of peace and security. But the beautiful dream is just a fantasy him dreamed, a fantasy he would like to live in. Him actually live in it, but is starting to recognize that it's a dream, as suggested in the text with the phrase "nice dream", sung repeatedly as a lullaby.

That song refers to a story by Kurt Vonnegut Cat's Cradle where this crystal's been found that turns all water completely solid and someone drops it into the sea. If you want to kill yourself you just put your finger into the water."

Kennedy has received significant support from independents, youth, and those with low trust in mainstream American politics. A November 2023 poll showed that he would win 22 percent of the vote if the 2024 presidential election was held then.

Kennedy is the eldest son of former U.S attorney general Robert Kennedy, who was a Democratic candidate for president in 1968. Kennedy is a nephew of John F. Kennedy, who was the 35th president of the United States from 1961 until his death in 1963.

Yaduvanshi caste

Yaduvanshi is an Ahir caste found in the Indian subcontinent, mainly modern-day India and Nepal. The Yaduvanshi Ahirs presence in India is well established through old writings and various Hindu scriptures from the ancient times going back to 6000 years B.C. The Ahirs all over India call themselves Yaduvanshi (Belonging to Yadu dynasty). Krishna was this dynasty; hence many of the customs associated with him are found in this society. They were rulers in different regions.

The name "Yadu" is of non-Indo-Aryan origin.

The Yaduvanshis claim descent from the Rigvedic Yadus tribe. The Yadus had a tribal union with the Turvasha tribe, and were frequently described together. The Yadus were a partly Indo-Aryan-acculturated Indus tribe. By the time of the arrival of the Puru and Bharata tribes, the Yadu-Turvashas were settled in Punjab, with the Yadus possibly residing along the Yamuna River. 

In the Rigveda, x.62.10, the Yadus and Turvashas are called dasas or barbarians. From these evidences R.P. Chanda infers that the Yadus were of homo-Alpinus origin, settled originally in Western Asia, whence they came to India settled in saurastra or kathiawad Peninsula and then spread to Mathura.

In later Hindu texts such as the "Mahabharata", the "Harivamsha" and the Puranas mention Yadu as the eldest son of king Yayati and his queen Devayani. The prince of King Yayati, Yadu was a self-respecting and a very established ruler. According to the "Vishnu Purana", the "Bhagavata Purana" and the "Garuda Purana", Yadu had four sons, while according to the rest of the Puranas he had five sons. The kings between Budha and Yayati were known as Somavanshi. According to a narrative found in the "Mahabharata", and the "Vishnu Purana", Yadu refused to exchange his years of youth with his father Yayati. So he was cursed by Yayati that none of Yadu's progeny shall possess the dominion under his father's command. Thereby, he could not have carried on the same dynasty, called Somavamshi. Notably, the only remaining dynasty of King Puru was entitled to be known as Somavamshi. Thereby King Yadu ordered that the future generations of his would be known as Yadavs and the dynasty would be known as "Yaduvanshi". The generations of Yadu had unprecedented growth and got divided into two branches.

Action bias

Action bias is a phenomenon from psychology. In a given situation, when people have a choice of doing nothing, and doing something (called an "action"), they will prefer doing something over not doing anything. This is also the case when there is no guarantee that the action would give a better result. It is an automatic response, similar to a reflex or an impulse and is not based on rational thinking. One of the first appearances of the term "action bias" in scientific journals was in a 2000 paper by Patt and Zechenhauser titled "Action Bias and Environmental Decisions", where the authrs looked at the relevance in politics.

Settler colonialism

When foreign people move and settle down on a piece of land that is already occupied by other people this is called settler colonialism. It is a form of colonialism.The people that were there before are called indigenous, or native. The new people will take away the land of the people who were already there, and replace them with what is called a settler society. Many people say that this is like a genocide. There are different ways in which this can be done,ranging from violent depopulation of the previous inhabitants to less deadly means, such as assimilation or recognition of Indigenous identity within a colonial framework.

Like other forms of colonialism, this kind is organized or supported by a central authority, for example a kingdom or empire. Settler colonialism contrasts with exploitation colonialism, which results from an economic policy of conquering territory to exploit its population as cheap or free labor and its natural resources as raw material. In this way, settler colonialism lasts indefinitely, except in the rare event of complete evacuation or settler decolonization. Political theorist Mahmoud Mamdani suggested that settlers could never succeed in their effort to become native, and therefore the only way to end settler colonialism was to erase the political significance of the settler–native dichotomy.

During the 1960s, settlement and colonization were seen as separate phenomena from colonialism. Settlement endeavors were seen as taking place in empty areas, downplaying the Indigenous inhabitants. Later on in the 1970s and 1980s, settler colonialism was seen as bringing high living standards in contrast to the failed political systems associated with classical colonialism. Beginning in the mid-1990s, the field of settler colonial studies was established. It is different from Indigenous studies but connected to it. Patrick Wolfe theorized settler colonialism as a structure (rather than an event) focused on the elimination rather than exploitation of the native population. He distinguished it from classical colonialism. Wolfe also argued that settler colonialism was centered on the control of land and that it continued after the closing of the frontier. His approach was defining for the field, but has been challenged by other scholars on the basis that many situations involve a combination of elimination and exploitation.

Settler colonial studies has often focused on British colonies in North America, Australia and New Zealand, which are close to the complete, prototypical form of settler colonialism, but is also applied to other cases including British Kenya, the Canary Islands, French Algeria, Generalplan Ost, German South West Africa, Hokkaido, Ireland, Israel/Palestine, Italian Libya and East Africa, Kashmir, Korea, Latin America, Liberia, Manchukuo, Posen and West Prussia, Rhodesia and South Africa.

Manson crater

The Manson crater is an impact crater near the site of Manson, Iowa. An asteroid or comet nucleus struck the Earth during the Cretaceous Period, approximately 74 million years ago. The event was one of the largest known impact events in North America. Until they found the ages of certain isotopes at the site, people believed that the event caused extinction of the dinosaurs. The ages sugges that the crater is too old.

As the site was covered by a glacial hill fairly recently, no eveidence of the crater can be seen on the surface. Today, the site of the crater is a flat landscape. Below the surface, hidden about below the surface is a buried structure about in diameter. It lies under the southeast corner of Pocahontas County and extends under portions of three counties. That an anomalous structure underlaid the area was known from unusual water well drill cuttings in 1912 of deformed rock, "crystalline clast breccia with a melt matrix" as a later report described it. A research investigation was started in 1955, and it was labeled a "cryptovolcanic structure" (a hypothetical volcanic steam explosion). Robert S. Dietz did some more investtifatiom and proposed an impact origin in 1959. Nicholas Short found evidence of shocked quartz grains in 1966. This confirmed the impact origin of the structure.

In 1991 and 1992 the U.S. Geological Survey along with others including the Iowa Geological Survey conducted detailed research in part to test the possible connection of the Manson Crater with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The / isotope ratio dating of the core from the impact structure gave an age of about 74 Ma, or about 10 Ma older than the K–T boundary.

The impactor is considered to have been a stony meteorite about in diameter. The site at the time was the shore of a shallow inland sea. the Western Interior Seaway. The impact disrupted granite, gneiss, and shales of the Precambrian basement as well as sedimentary formations of Paleozoic age, Devonian through Cretaceous. Limestone layers that give the rest of Iowa hard water were instantaneously vaporized down to the basement rocks, giving Manson the anomalous soft water that it has today.

Middleware

Middleware is a computing component that sits between other components and can usually be described as 'software glue', mediating between pieces of software. 

There is a lot of ambiguity around the specifics of what middleware is. The term is used differently in different sub fields of computing and even ambiguously within some of those sub fields. It's one of those terms which should probably be agreed upon by actors involved, before it is used in any consequential situation. 

One of the latter uses of the term might be qualified as Messaging Middleware - message brokers and queues - and can be part of:

Rhizodeposition

What is Rhizodeposition: 

Rhizodeposition refers to the chemical process that happens in the , a small area of the soil that is directly changed by the release of plant root products and the . Rhizodeposition refers to the process that happens in small gaps within the soil that can contain many types of bacteria, fungi and nematodes (worm-like parasites) that can feed off the products released by the plant roots. Products released from the plant roots can be elements such as Nitrogen, Carbon, and other different proteins and sugars, these feed the plant root's microbiome. This is a form of symbiosis (mutualism) between the microorganisms and the plant that benefits from products produced by the microbes in the soil. An example of this is antibiotics that will kill harmful bacteria in the plant. The microorganisms will also provide the plant with enzymes, plant hormones and phosphates as well. 

Why is Rhizodeposition important: 

Rhizodeposition plays a very important role in connection with the carbon cycle. Out of all the carbon that the plant absorbs through photosynthesis around 25% of the carbon will be released through the roots of the soil, this carbon is what many of the microorganisms feed on in regards to rhizodeposition. Without this exchange of carbon, the microorganisms would not have one of the most important building blocks to life and would likely die. Similarly, the plants would significantly lack the antibiotics, hormones, enzymes and phosphates required to survive and would either die or be very weak. 

Examples of Rhizodeposition:

In a study conducted on "Triticum Sp." () it was found that the Spelt Wheat was more productive in the presence of microorganisms that make up the rhizosphere than the Spelt Wheat that contained minimal microorganisms (the study notes that it is hard to maintain sterile soil). Specifically, wheat benefiting from rhizodeposition was able to grow higher faster and develop a root system that went wider and deeper. Harvest size from wheat with microorganisms was also much larger compared to wheat without/lacking microorganisms.

First Horizon Park

First Horizon Park is a baseball park in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. It is the home stadium of the Nashville Sounds, who are a Minor League Baseball team. It opened on April 17, 2015, and has room for up to 10,000 people. It was named First Tennessee Park from 2015 to 2019. Before playing there, the Sounds played at a stadium called Herschel Greer Stadium from 1978 to 2014.

The ballpark was built for the the Nashville Sounds, but other sports teams have also played at the stadium. Nashville SC, a soccer team of the USL Championship, played its games there from 2018 to 2019.



Rochdale Canal

The Rochdale Canal runs between Manchester and Sowerby Bridge. It runs through the town of Rochdale. It is a broad canal because its locks are wide enough to allow boats of 14 feet (4.3 m) width. It runs for 32 miles (51 km) across the Pennines from the Bridgewater Canal at Castlefield Basin in Manchester to join the Calder and Hebble Navigation in West Yorkshire.

James Brindley was paid to survey possible routes between Sowerby Bridge and Manchester in 1776. John Rennie made a new survey in 1791. In April 1794 the Act of Parliament was made to fix the route. The first part was opened in 1798 and it was finished in 1814. There were 92 locks.

Between 1830 and 1832, the canal carried 539,081 tons per year, which generated £40,123 in revenue. In 1839, this had risen to 875,436 tons, generating £62,712 but the opening of the Manchester and Leeds Railway in 1841 made it drop. The charges were reduced and the link to Manchester Ship Canal helped to keep it going, but most of it was closed in 1952. The Rochdale Canal Society worked hard to get it open again. On 1 July 2002 the canal was opened again for boats along its entire length. 

Bridgewater Canal

The Bridgewater Canal connects Runcorn, Manchester and Leigh, in North West England. It was started by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to carry coal from his mines in Worsley to Manchester. It was opened in 1761 from Worsley to Manchester. Later it went from Manchester to Runcorn, and then from Worsley to Leigh. It is connected to the Manchester Ship Canal by a lock at Cornbrook; to the Rochdale Canal in Manchester; to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook, southeast of Runcorn; and to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Leigh. 

The Sankey Canal was built first, but the Bridgewater Canal became more famous and set a lot more canals going. It has an aqueduct to cross the River Irwell, and a tunnel at Worsley. 

D. J. Moore

Denniston Oliver "D. J." Moore Jr. (born April 14, 1997) is an American football wide receiver for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL).

He attended the University of Maryland and played for the Terrapins from 2015 to 2017.

He was selected by the Carolina Panthers as the 24th overall pick in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft, making him the first wide receiver chosen in that draft. He later signed a 4-year contract with a signing bonus of $6.2 million.

In his second week against the Atlanta Falcons, he scored his first touchdown on his very first NFL reception. However, in the final seconds of the game, he missed catching a pass from his quarterback Cam Newton that could have sent the game into overtime. He finished his rookie season with 788 yards on 55 receptions and 2 touchdowns, earning a spot on the league's All-Rookie Team selected by the Pro Football Writers Association.

The following season, he became one of the main targets among the team's wide receivers, ending the season as the Panthers' top receiver with 1,175 receiving yards.

In March 2022, he signed a new 3-year contract worth $61.9 million with the Panthers.

In March 2023, the Panthers traded Moore, the 9th overall pick in the 2023 draft, and three other draft picks to the Chicago Bears in exchange for the first overall pick in the 2023 draft.

Brigada Mass Media Corporation

Brigada Mass Media Corporation (BMMC) is a newspaper company and media network in the Philippines. It is the first-ever local Tri-media organization to have emerged from the Soccsksargen area as a national network with its array of Brigada News FM stations. BMMC is part of Brigada Group of Companies of Entrepreneur Elmer Catulpos which also maintains eight newspaper editions in the Philippines, four TV Stations, distribution of food supplements, medicines, cosmetics and engine care, a drug pharmacy a garden resort and two public security agencies.

In October 14, 2012, it expanded its operations once more to television with Brigada News TeleRadyo 46 (now Channel 39) Eye of Mindanao, acquired from Asian Multimedia and Production, which is the first-ever local television station and neighboring areas of General Santos its launch on January 6, 2013, which devotes 70-80％ of its programs to local issues and concerns. Given its still very short stint in the television industry, it has already eaten up a big slice of the pie of viewership especially its news and public affairs programs in the prime time slots morning and afternoon. Since December 2015, Brigada News TeleRadyo moved to Channel 34, until september 2019, when it moved to its present Channel 39 with 10,000 Watts of power.

Since Febtuary 2013, Brigada News FM expanded to 25 cities and municipalities in the Philippines through its subsequent acquisition and 100％ takeover of Baycomms Broadcasting Corporation, its owned and operated stations and other small radio networks.

In April 2014, Brigada News FM National Offices in Makati was inagurated and relocated Brigada News FM Batangas to became Brigada News FM National, which later moved to Mareco-owned 105.1 in July 1, 2023, and completing the three broadcast centers of the network, Manila, Cebu and General Santos.

As of 2022, BMMC has now 60 owned and operated stations in the country, larger than its main all-news and talk radio competitor Radyo5 News FM, but is ahead of another news and talk radio competitor of Bandera News Philippines and another one ahead of news and talk radio competitor of XFM Philippines.


Brigada News FM Stations are collectively known as Brigada News FM with its current taglines The Music and News Authority and In the Heart of Changing Lives. Currently, Brigada News FM has more than 60 owned and operated FM stations across the country, the most number of stations for a news-formatted radio network compared to their other networks in AM radio and more are planned to be opened.

Majority of BMMC's stations are acquired from Baycomms (prior to the merger in 2013), hence becoming Brigada's official broadcast licensee, except the following stations that are either acquired or operated under airtime lease agreement:

Leeds and Liverpool Canal

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs from Leeds to Liverpool. It is 127 miles (204 km) long. It goes over the Pennines. There are 91 locks on the main line and several small branches. It is the longest continuous canal in the United Kingdom.

It was started when people saw the success of the Bridgewater Canal which opened in 1759–60. It joins the Bridgewater Canal at Leigh, by a branch from Wigan.

James Brindley made the plan, but he died in 1772. Work was started on both sides of the Pennines. This included some impressive engineering like the Bingley Five Rise Locks, Bingley Three Rise Locks and the seven-arch aqueduct over the River Aire. Work stopped in 1781 because the money ran out. It started again in in 1791, on a different route from the earlier plan, and the main line of the canal was finished in 1816. This included the Foulridge Tunnel, which was 1,640 yards (1,500 m) long and was very expensive, and the Burnley Embankment, which is 1,350 yards (1,234 m) long and up to 60 feet (18 m) high.

The Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Rochdale Canal crossed the Pennines before it was finished.

The most important cargo was always coal, with over a million tons per year being delivered to Liverpool in the 1860s. Because it could have wide boats it competed successfully with the railways throughout the 19th century and stayed open through the 20th century.

In the Second World War a German bomb fell on it in Bootle.

In 2009 a new section was built, connecting it to the docks in the centre of Liverpool, which had become a centre of tourism.

Lord Street, Southport

Lord Street is the main shopping street of Southport, in Merseyside. It is 1 mile (1.6 km) long, with a roundabout at each end . There are many gardens and architectural listed buildings along it with a mix of residential, commercial and public buildings. It was built in the early 19th century.

Napoleon III stayed on holiday nearby in 1846. Lord Street is thought to be the inspiration for the tree-lined boulevards of Paris, built between 1854 and 1870.

Calder and Hebble Navigation

The Calder and Hebble Navigation is a broad waterway, with locks and bridges that are suitable for 14-foot-wide (4.3 m) boats, in West Yorkshire.

Improvements on the River Calder and the River Hebble began in 1759, The Rochdale Canal joined it in 1804. This let boats go from Sowerby Bridge to Manchester. It connects to the Aire and Calder Navigation at Wakefield. It joins the Huddersfield Broad Canal near Mirfield. There were many alterations over the years, so now it is mostly seperate from the river. 

The locks were designed for Yorkshire Keels. They are among the shortest on the English connected waterways network, at 57 feet (17 m).

Since 1981 it has only been used by pleasure boats.

River Calder

The River Calder is a river in West Yorkshire. It starts above Todmorden, and drains an area of 369 square miles (957 km). It joins the River Aire near Castleford

Only a few bits of the river can be used by boats but they are connected by the Calder and Hebble Navigation, a popular leisure waterway which is part of the connected inland waterway network of England and Wales.

Many woolen mills were built along its banks, particularly at Dewsbury and Wakefield, but also in the smaller towns of Brighouse, Hebden Bridge, Sowerby Bridge and Todmorden. It used to have salmon, but they were killed by pollution in the mid 19th century. In 2008 they were seen again. 

At Wakefield's there is a nine-arched bridge, 320 feet (98 m) long, built in sandstone between 1342 and 1356.

Shendao shejiao

Shendao teaching () is a Chinese philosophy about religion. It originally meant following the natural way of things and setting up teaching to make people behave. Later on, it was used to educate people by talking about how good and bad things happen as a result of their actions. The idea of Shendao started in the early Western Zhou period and later became important in Confucianism as a way to teach character. Some people believe that it helped China understand and adopt the Western idea of religion. 

During the Shang dynasty in China, people believed in many gods. The most important god was called "Shangdi," but some people thought of Shangdi as just a part of the natural order of things, which they called "Tiandao." They believed that the emperor did not have control over this natural order. During Shang sacrifices, people didn't offer sacrifices to the emperor, but they would ask for the emperor's help. The Shang people believed in ghosts and gods, which was similar to what people believed in prehistoric times. They didn't use religion as a way to control people like some later dynasties did..

The Zhou dynasty of ancient China believed in the divinity of Shangdi, the supreme god, and diminished the importance of other ancestral and natural gods that were worshipped during the previous dynasty. The king of Zhou set up an "imperial registry" to worship God, and built a god of the land with chestnut wood to inspire fear in the people. The Zhou also created an "imperial court" as the emperor's office. The Zhou believed that the emperor could send down a great Lu order to protect his house and people. The world of the gods, mainly the "emperor" and "heaven," became the foundation for the kingship of the Zhou Dynasty. They established the concept of rule with "Mandate of Heaven" as the core, and the king was referred to as "Son of Heaven." This practice of the Zhou was Shendao's establishment of religion, which became a tool for political rule and adapted to the needs of patriarchal kingship.Confucianism, on the other hand, believed in the fear of heaven, adults, and the words of the saints, but did not believe in gods. 

Shendao is a religion that believes in ghosts and gods. It originated from the Tuan Chuan of the Zhou Yi. The ancient Chinese rulers used religious beliefs to strengthen their power, which is called the divine right of "Heaven and Man". This involved using practices like sacrifice and divination to gain support from the people. However, some thinkers did not believe in ghosts and gods, like Fan Zhen. He still believed in the importance of Shendao as a way to govern the country, bring peace to the people, and change traditions.



Tiandao

Tiandao (; Vietnamese: "Thiên Đạo", Japanese: "Tendō") is a Chinese word used in many philosophical and religious contexts in China and the Sinosphere. It can also refer specifically to:

Book of Rites

The Book of Rites, also called the Liji, is a group of writings that explain the customs, rules, and ceremonies of the Zhou dynasty during the Warring States and early Han periods. The Book of Rites, the Rites of Zhou, and the Ettiquette and Ceremonial are called the "Three Li," and together make up the ritual section of the Five Classics. These are important texts in Confucianism, which is a way of thinking that values ethics and education. Some people believe that the Book of Rites was originally called the Classic of Rites or Lijing, but its name was changed later by Dai Sheng.

Toyama Chukyoin

Chukyoin was a type of institution created to promote the teachings of the Taikyo Institute. There was one on each capital of a Prefecture of Japan.. 

The Taikyo Institute, literally had sub institutions across Japan called and . Every prefecture had its own Chukyoin in its capital and this was the one of Toyama Prefecture. Shokyoins were scattered all across the country. The size comparison resembles the words for University, Middle school, and Elementary school. 

All of them however promoted the same Taikyo proclamation teachings.

In 1875 the Taikyo Institute was closed, and the building became an office of the Bureau of Shinto Affairs. Then in 1882 it became a Jingukyo office.

Around the Chukyoin site, there was a night market that became famous in 1904.

In 1925, the Chukyoin was relocated near Toyama Gokoku Shrine to make way for a new streetcar line. Only a small shrine remains at the original location, as the streetcar was later removed.

The Chukyoin (now affiliated with Jingukyo) was completely destroyed on August 2, 1945 during an air raid.

During World War II the night market was damaged and unused until its repair in 1950. It was still operational in 1999. and 2011

After the war people rebuilt the shrine on its original location. The shrine can be found next to the bus stop Chukyoin Mae. It is known as the smallest shrine in Japan.

The shrine building was rennovated in 2020.


Toyama Gokoku Shrine

Toyama Gokoku Shrine (富山縣護國神社, "Toyamaken gokoku jinja") is a Gokoku shrine that is located in Toyama, a city in Toyama Prefecture in Japan. The shrine is dedicated to the kami or spirits of those who died as martyrs serving their country. The shrine's annual festivals are celebrated on April 25 and October 5. It was established in 1913.


Gokoku Shrines

Gokoko shrines are Japanese shinto shrines made to for people who died in wars. They are considered "branches" of Yasukuni Shrine. They used to be called Shokonsha but the name was changed in 1939.

Unity of Heaven and humanity

Unity of Heaven and humanity is an old philosophical concept in China that can be found in various Chinese religions and philosophies. The main idea is that things like human ethics, physiology, and politics reflect Tian, which means "heaven" or "nature".

The concept of unity of heaven and humanity has its roots in ancient Chinese religion, where people believed in spirits and experienced trances. This early shamanistic experience can still be observed in present-day Chinese folk religion. The idea was first mentioned in the Spring and Autumn Warring States period and was further developed in Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism.

Dong Zhongshu referenced the concept as "heaven and mankind induction" during the Han Dynasty, while the Cheng-Zhu school of Neo-Confucianism believed it was based on the theory of the Divine Principle.

In Daoism, the concept of Tian or "Heaven" is viewed as nature, and humans are considered to be a part of nature. The saying goes, "If there is man, there is also heaven; if there is heaven, there is also man." This belief reflects the idea that heaven and earth are interconnected and all things in the world are unified. As the philosopher Zhuangzi stated, "Heaven and earth were born with me, and all things are one with me."

The Huangdi Neijing is a traditional Chinese medicine text that supports the idea of the unity of Heaven and humanity. According to the text, humans are connected to nature and should be in harmony with the four seasons. The text emphasizes that humans participate in and are one with heaven and earth. It states that humans have a unified origin, properties, structure, and laws with heaven, which is considered an objective existence independent of human spiritual consciousness. The text also suggests that humans have spiritual consciousness and are a subject with it.

The concept of "unity of God and humanity" in the Western world is similar to the Chinese idea of "unity of Heaven and humanity," but there are some differences. In ancient Greece, only a sorcerer with special powers could achieve the "unity of God and humanity." In Christianity, anyone who confesses their sins and accepts Jesus Christ as God's only Son can become a child of God and enter eternal life. The Islamic view emphasizes that believers should observe "good works."

In Indian culture, the central theme of the Upanishads, which are great classic texts, is the unity of Brahman (Moksha). This principle is practiced by profound yogis and is similar to the Chinese idea of the unity of heaven and humanity.



Shrine Parishioner Registration

The Regulations for Shrine Parishioner Registration were rules made by the Council of State (Dajōkan) in Japan. They were in place for two years from 1871 to 1873. The rules required everyone to register at shinto shrines. This was similar to an earlier system called the which did the same for Buddhist temples.

The official name of the law is .

The law had seven parts. The first part said that when a baby was born, the parents had to tell the village head. Then, they had to take the baby to the local shrine to get a special amulet. This amulet had to stay with the baby. If someone did not have this amulet, they had to tell the village head their name, birthdate, where they were born, and their father's name. The village head would then get an amulet for them. The village head would check the amulets every six years when they did a registration exercise. If someone died, their amulet had to go back to the shrine priest. 

Another set of rules was made at the same time called Regulations for Rural District Shrines. This set of rules said that each district had to have one rural district shrine responsible for overseeing registration. These rules were supposed to register all newborn babies. Some people think that these rules were also supposed to make shrines like temples from earlier times in Japan. These rules only lasted for two years, but the rules for district shrines lasted until after World War II. The Shrine Consolidation Policy merged shrines together for this purpose.

Friedrich Paulus was a German field marshal served the Wehrmacht during World War II.

Taikyo Institute

The was a Japanese Institution and part of the Ministry of Religion in the Empire of Japan.

The Taikyo Institute was established in 1872 with the aim of training kyōdo shōku or religious teachers. This was because the Missionary Office and Department of Divinities were not successful in their national indoctrination objectives. The institute was originally intended as a joint organization between Shinto and Buddhism, but eventually became completely dominated by Shinto. 

On January 1, 1875, there was a fire at the Taikyo Institute caused by arson. This caused confusion and led to four Jōdo Shinshū sects announcing informally that they were leaving the Taikyo Institute..

On May 3, 1875, the Great Teaching Institute was disbanded by the Ministry of Religion and was replaced by the Bureau of Shinto Affairs and later Shinto Taikyo.

The "Great Teaching" and "Taikyo Proclamation" use the same word, as does "Taikyo" in "Shinto Taikyo".




Dewsbury

Dewsbury is a market town in the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees in West Yorkshire. It is on the River Calder. A bit of the Calder and Hebble Navigation waterway goes there. It is to the west of Wakefield, east of Huddersfield and south of Leeds.

It was an important centre for wool milling. They collected used woollen items, mixed them with new wool and made heavy blankets and uniforms.

Dewsbury Minster is near the River Calder. Some of it was built in the 13th century. The market was set up in the 14th century.

In 1770, a short branch of the Calder and Hebble Navigation reached the town. That helped the mills because the boats could get to to Manchester and Hull.

The town now has a large Muslim community.

Shrine Consolidation Policy

The Shrine Consolidation Policy was a plan by the Meiji Japanese government to get rid of many small Shinto shrines and combine their duties with bigger regional shrines.. In 1900, a government branch called the Bureau of Shrines (Jinja kyoku) was formed as part of the Home Ministry. This branch was in charge of carrying out the Shrine Consolidation Policy.

The Shrine Consolidation Policy was made to decrease the power of Shinto, and the government wanted to control the remaining shrines. The goal was to make the shrines easier to manage. Even though many people didn't like it, 77,899 Shinto shrines were closed in the first twenty years of the policy. The Shrine Consolidation Policy was in effect until the end of World War II, but it had the biggest impact in the first six years after it started in 1906. By 1912, the number of shrines that were closed decreased significantly.

To strengthen shrines, the government either moved the deities from smaller shrines to larger ones or combined multiple shrines' deities into one shrine. The result was fewer, larger shrines under government control.

During the Meiji and Taisho eras, the Japanese government merged smaller, unprofitable shrines in an effort to enhance the presence of shrines overall. The Bureau of Shrines in the Home Ministry was responsible for this reorganization, focusing on village shrines and unranked shrines. The government's goal was to organize existing shrines and limit the number of shrines receiving offerings. However, there were accusations of corruption and attempts to seize land for financial gain. In 1906, an imperial edict called "With Regard to the Provision of Offerings to Shrines of Prefectural Rank and Below" was issued to financially support thriving shrines only, leading to the merging of many shrines. Under the edict, merged shrines, temples, and other sacred sites were required to surrender their land without compensation. Local authorities in Wakayama and Mie prefectures in particular carried out mergers, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of shrines by 1914.

Some intellectuals and politicians resisted the merger policy, leading to its eventual eschewal by the Bureau of Shrines. 

The "Shrine merger" policy aimed to decrease the number of shrines in Japan and focus resources on those remaining. This was done to ensure that the remaining shrines had facilities and properties that met a certain standard, and to maintain their dignity while establishing their continuous management. Additionally, the Meiji government recognized sect Shinto as a religion, but considered shrines as "national religious ceremonies" rather than religious. The policy of reducing the number of shrines was also implemented to make it financially possible for local governments to provide public funds to prefectural shrines and smaller shrines, according to the Ministry of the Interior.

The Ministry of Home Affairs' Bureau of Shrines was responsible for implementing this policy. However, it seems that the Ministry's Regional Bureaus also played a role. These local bureaus were not willing to let local governments use public funds to support shrines below the prefectural level, which was one of the goals of merging shrines. This was because it would increase the financial burden on the local governments. Nevertheless, this was still included in the policy.

The "shrine-centered theory" is the belief that local communities in Japan should focus on their shrines as a way to promote self-governance. This led to a policy of enshrining one shrine per town or village, which was called "one town, one village, one shrine." By using the Ujiko area associated with the shrine to align with administrative divisions, the government aimed to make the shrine the central hub of local activities.

In 1906, the Japanese Minister of the Interior, Takashi Hara, created a policy called the "shrine ritual policy." This policy aimed to regulate how people used shrines in Japan. At first, it was not strictly enforced, but later, the Minister of Interior of the Second Katsura Cabinet, Tosuke Hirata, made it stronger. Consequently, many shrines were demolished, especially in Mie, Wakayama, and Ehime prefectures. However, the degree of implementation varied in different regions, and some areas, like Kyoto, did not see significant changes. By 1914, about 200,000 shrines were affected nationwide, as 70,000 of them were destroyed.

The shrine consolidation policy, which was based on bureaucratic rationalism, was not always implemented in accordance with the wishes of the shrine parishioners and worshippers. Settlements and administrative divisions did not always match, which resulted in some Ujigami being moved to places far from their worshippers due to the shrine mergers. As a result, some Ujigami were unable to be worshipped. Although some shrine parishioners refused to worship, in some places they were forced to worship.

The parishioners and worshippers of the affected shrines did sometimes hold meetings to voice their opposition, but for the most part, they couldn't fight against the policy. Their dissatisfaction was often expressed in the form of stories about how the deities of the abolished shrines caused supernatural occurrences or hauntings.

That said, intellectuals such as Kumagusu Minakata, a naturalist and folklore scholar known for his research on slime molds, strongly opposed this policy. In the south, the shrine merger movement was


The opposition movements against the Shrine Consolidation Policy eventually stopped, and the Imperial Diet responded by temporarily halting the sudden increase in shrine merging after 1910 (1910-1943). However, the policy had already caused significant damage, resulting in the loss of many rituals and customs, and harming religious beliefs. Although the policy was eventually halted, the damage caused by it was significant and long-lasting. 

After World War II, the system of non-religious shrines that existed before the war was abolished, and all shrines became religious corporations. Many shrines that were previously merged were later restored. Even after a shrine was officially enshrined, some of its facilities were left behind, making it easier to restore them. It was generally easier to restore shrines in places where the traditional reverence for the shrine was maintained, but if the community that supported the shrine disappeared or changed due to changes in administrative boundaries or other circumstances, restoration was more difficult.



Herschel Greer Stadium

The Sounds played there for 37 years. Their last game was on August 27, 2014. In 2015, the Sounds began to play at a new stadium called First Horizon Park. Greer Stadium was demolished to become part of a park in 2019.

The ballpark was built for the the Nashville Sounds, but other sports teams have also played at the stadium. Another baseball team, the Nashville Xpress, played there in 1993 and 1994 at the same time as the Sounds. The stadium was famous for having a scoreboard shaped like a guitar.

Earnings before interest and taxes

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is a measure of a firm's profit that includes all incomes and expenses except interest and income tax. It is used as a measure of the money a business really makes.

Oyagami

Oyagami (祖神) is a Japanese literally meaning "parent deity." It sometimes expresses the belief that kami, or divine beings, care for human beings in the same way that human parents care for their children, similar to how God the father expresses that. This concept can be found in two forms: an abstract idea that has been around since ancient times, and a more codified concept that developed within certain Shinto sects and new religions.

Some Shinto sects believe that the entire world or cosmos is a living entity, full of vitality and productive power that originates from the oyagami, which is the ultimate existence that gives birth to everything. According to this belief, humans are "offspring of the kami" and have been given life by them. This doctrine suggests that humans have the potential to become kami themselves, as they are originally made of the same substance as the divine beings.

In the Tenrikyō new religion, the main deity is called "Oyagami," and the sect's founder is known as "Oyasama." This use of the word "parent" before the name of the kami being worshipped is believed to reflect the traditional Japanese understanding of the meaning of divine beings. Overall, the concept of oyagami emphasizes the close relationship between humans and kami and the belief that divine beings care for humans like parents care for their children.

The Imperial Household and Uji clans believe in ancestor gods from a long time ago. They are considered the god or person that started the family line. The clan is a group of people who feel like they are family because they have the same ancestor god. This idea used to be very important, but over time it became less important. The clan gods used to be based on family ties, but later became more connected to the land they lived on, and were like other local gods.

The word means "parent god".

It is the title God goes by in Tenrikyo.


Tutelary deity

A tutelary deity is a deity or spirit that serves as a guardian of a thing. That thing can range from a country to an occupation. 

In ancient Greek and Roman religions, there were special gods called tutelary deities. One type of tutelary deity was called the genius. The genius was like a personal guardian spirit that was with a person from the time they were born until they died.

Another type of personal guardian spirit is called a familiar spirit. This type of spirit is found in European folklore.


United Team of Germany at the Olympics

The United Team of Germany was a combined team from West Germany and East Germany that competed in the 1956, 1960 and 1964 Winter and Summer Olympic Games. In the 1968 Winter Olympics, East and West Germany competed as separate teams but they both used the same compromise Olympic flag and Beethoven anthem. From the 1972 Winter Olympics the two teams competed separately with separate flags and anthems.

Bureau of Shinto Affairs

The was an organization in Japan that succeeded the Taikyo Institute in 1875. The Bureau of Shinto Affairs was an organization during the Meiji era that united different Shinto groups across Japan. It was a public institution and had a student dormitory to train priests. It was also responsible for accrediting Sect Shinto.

The Bureau of Shinto Affairs trained priests but faced conflicts over differences in beliefs. This led to the Ise sect becoming more prominent and the Izumo sect being marginalized.

In 1882, the Bureau of Shinto Affairs was turned into a Shinto sect due to a government ordinance requiring the separation of shrine priests and missionaries or theologians. As a result, in 1884, the missionaries of both Shinto and Buddhism were suppressed. The government then established the Office of Japanese Classics Research as a replacement for the Bureau.

In 1886, the Bureau of Shinto Affairs reorganized itself as the Shinto Headquarters (Shinto Honkyoku) and later changed its name to Shinto Taikyo.

In 1912, a group called The Thirteen Schools of Shinto including the Shinto Headquarters joined together to create the Kyoha Shinto Rengokai (Association of Sectarian Shinto)..



Jingu-kyo

In 1872, Urata Nagatami asked for permission to start a Shinto church called Jingū Kyōkai, shortly after the Ministry of Religion was created. He opened teaching centers and religious groups to organize his disciples, then combined them under the name Divine Wind Religious Association in 1873. Popular pilgrimage groups that were already established were also included. The Jingūkyo Institute started spreading its teachings throughout the country after the dissolution of the Daikyōin in 1875.

In 1882, the Kyodo Shoku was abolished, which led to the Jingūkyo Institute declaring itself independent from the official Grand Shrine Administration Office and renaming itself Jingūkyō. Tanaka Yoritsune became the first superintendent after Urata resigned. Membership increased until the late 1880s, but there was little growth afterward. In 1898, Japan's Civil Law was passed, and there was a movement to make the Jingūkyō a service organization for the Grand Shrines of Ise. As a result, the Jingūkyō was reorganized into the Jingū Hōsaikai in September 1899.

It was reorganized as such in part because it had a major burden of distrubiting Jingu Taima and this was criticized as that was used all across Japan.

The Jingū Hōsaikai still follows the same basic ideals as Jingūkyō, focusing on the Grand Shrines of Ise, Emperor worship, studying kokugaku. Even today, the legacy of Jingūkyō can be seen in Japanese society and culture.

With the help of the National Association of Shinto Priests, the Office of Japanese Classics Research it founded the Association of Shinto Shrines.

Jerome and Jeremiah Valeska

Jerome and Jeremiah Valeska are fictional characters from the television show Gotham and are its version of The Joker. They are played by Cameron Monaghan.

In the episode The Blind Fortune Teller, Detective James Gordon looks into the murder of a female snake dancer at a circus and talks to her eighteen year old son Jerome Valeska. At the end of the episode, it turns out Jerome killed her for fun and when he’s caught, he admits it and laughs.

Jerome Valeska is broken out of Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane by the new villain and becomes the leader of a gang of terrorists who call themselves Maniax! They kill the Mayor. They kill the person in charge of the Police. They massacre the police station and they steal a bus full of high school cheerleaders and try to kill them with explosives. Jerome also kills his father, a blind fortune teller. Jerome kills a magician and pretends to be him so that he can try to kill Bruce Wayne. Jerome kills the other terrorists for fun once he doesn’t need them anymore and he tries to kill Bruce. But then Theodore Galavan, who broke Jerome out of Arkham, kills Jerome so that Bruce will trust him.

A cult which worships Jerome Valeska finds his body and uses a machine they stole from mad scientist Hugo Strange to bring him back to life. When it doesn’t work, the cult leader cuts off Jerome’s face and wears it like a mask. Then Jerome comes back to life, kills the cult leader and takes the mask back. Then Jerome shuts down all the electricity in all of Gotham City and people start rioting. Jerome then kidnaps Bruce Wayne and takes him to his circus which he took over to kill him. Jerome tells Bruce what he wants is to prove that everyone is evil and that “there are no heroes in Gotham”. Jerome also tries to have Alfred Pennyworth murdered. Bruce manages to fight Jerome and beat him but he refuses to kill him even after Jerome loses his face in the fight. The police send Jerome to a hospital where he gets plastic surgery to get his face back and then put him back in Arkham Asylum.

After The Penguin is sent to Arkham Asylum for murder he meets Jerome Valeska. Jerome wants The Penguin to be the supervillain everyone says he is and when he’s not, he has everyone else attack, threaten, harass beat up and bully The Penguin to get him to show how dangerous he is. When that doesn’t happen Jerome decides to kill the Penguin. Then the Penguin outsmarts him, fights him, while miming, and beats him and after that Jerome starts to respect The Penguin. Later Jerome escapes with the Scarecrow, The Mad Hatter and other violent supercriminals and starts his own team called The Legion of Horribles with The Penguin Solomon Grundy, Firefly and Victor Freeze. Scarecrow creates a poison gas for Jerome that causes insanity and Jerome kidnaps the Mayor and city council and says that he’ll kill them unless his identical twin brother Jeremiah Valeska and his enemy Bruce Wayne surrender to him. Jeremiah refuses to do that until Bruce convinces him that it’s the right thing. Jerome tries to kill them both but Captain James Gordon rescues them. So instead Jerome decides to drop his insanity gas from a blimp so that everyone will be violent and insane. The Penguin then decides to tell Captain Gordon but Gordon ignores him since he doesn’t trust The Penguin.

When The Penguin tries to convince Scarecrow and Mad Hatter not to go through with Jerome’s plan, they lock him in the Blimp. Jerome attacks Gotham City and Captain Gordon fights him and Jerome loses and falls to his death but he warns that what he did is just the beginning. The Penguin escapes and steers the blimp out of Gotham City. Jerome realized that that might happen so he sent Jeremiah his insanity gas turning Jeremiah’s skin white and making him a psychopath. Jeremiah then tries to convince his friend Bruce Wayne to help him destroy Gotham City. When Bruce doesn’t, Jeremiah uses Jerome’s cult to try to kill Bruce. When that doesn’t work, Jeremiah teams up with Ra’s al-Ghul, stabs Bruce’s girlfriend Selina Kyle, destroys every bridge out of Gotham City with bombs and shuts down all electricity in Gotham City. The police then abandon Gotham except Captain Gordon and some others and criminals take over the city.

Jeremiah Valeska fakes his own death with the help of his sidekick Echo and has people kidnapped, enslaved and forced to tunnel out of Gotham City so that he can flood the island. He also kidnaps Bruce Wayne and mind controls Alfred Pennyworth and two people who look like Bruce’s dead parents so that he can make Bruce relive the night his parents were murdered. Jeremiah also kidnaps and tries to kill Captain James Gordon and his psychiatrist girlfriend in front of Bruce. Later on, Jeremiah and Bruce fight and Bruce pushes Jeremiah into a tank of dangerous chemicals. Jeremiah survives but ends up in a coma and stays in it for the next 10 years during which The Riddler stabbed him for fun. So as revenge, Jeremiah tricked The Riddler into escaping Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane and framed The Penguin for it. Jeremiah also killed Echo after she stopped being useful to him. And Jeremiah tried to kill Commissioner James Gordon and tells him his name isn’t Jeremiah anymore but something else that starts with the letter J. Then Jeremiah is attacked by a man dressed up as a bat and the Batman sends him back to Arkham.

Unity of knowledge and action

The Unity of knowledge and action (知行合一) is a concept in philosophy created by Wang Yangming. It means that knowledge and action should go together and help each other. This idea says that only by behaving well can someone become wise. It is similar to the Western idea called virtue epistemology.

In Chinese philosophy, knowledge and action were usually seen as related but different. Wang disagreed and said there was no difference between them. He thought that knowledge was knowing how to act in a situation, based on his ideas about people and their innate knowledge. He also believed that the world was always changing, rather than staying the same, which is similar to the Western idea of Process philosophy.

Wang Yangming created the idea during the Ming dynasty.

Wang Yangming disagreed with the teachings of Zhu Xi, a famous philosopher. Zhu Xi encouraged students to study in two parts, one theoretical and one practical. Wang believed this approach made people ineffective.

Western philosophers talk about akrasia, which is when someone does something they know is wrong on purpose. But Wang disagrees. He says that just saying you know something is wrong isn't enough. You have to actually act on what you know for it to count. For example, if a student cheats on a test but says cheating is wrong, Wang would say they don't really understand what they're saying..

The idea of combining knowledge and action is not exclusive to Chinese philosophy. Similar ideas can be found in Western literature. Hermann Hesse in his novel "Demian" writes that only the thoughts we put into action have real value. The motto of MIT, "Mens et Manus" or "Mind and Hand," also emphasizes the importance of combining inner knowledge with actions.

The idea of virtue Epistemology in contemporary Western philosophy also shares similarities with Wang Yangming's concept of the Unity of Knowledge and Action. Both emphasize the importance of practical wisdom and the integration of knowledge and action.

Zhangixalus

Zhangixalus is a group of frogs in the subfamily Rhacophorinae, family Rhacophoridae. They are called Zhang's treefrogs in English. They live in the Eastern Himalayas, southern China, Taiwan, Japan, and southeast Asia.

The frogs are named for Zhang Ya-Ping from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Zhang worked in biodiversity and evolution research in China. "Ixalus" is a word that means treefrogs.

Scientists made the group "Zhangixalus" in a 2019 when they were looking at the very large genus "Rhacophorus" (92 species). They divided "Rhacophorus" into three groups: "Rhacophorus" sensu stricto (then 39 species; as of November 2021, 43 species), "Leptomantis" (then 14 species; as of November 2021, 13 species), and "Zhangixalus" (then 37 species; as of November 2021, 40 species). They did this because of molecular data, such as DNA, but also because they could see differences in the frogs' bodies and in the places where they lived. "Rhacophorus" is the sister taxon of "Zhangixalus" and "Leptomantis".

"Zhangixalus" are large frogs, ranging between in from nose to rear end, but most are more than more than . The snout is round. The terminal phalanges of fingers and toes are Y-shaped. Dorsal skin is smooth or has some small bumps. Most frogs have green skins. The female lays eggs in white foam nests that the two frogs make together.

"Zhangixalus" has frogs that seem not to be related to other frogs: "Z. achantharrhena", "Z. dulitensis", and "Z. prominanus". They are different from other "Zhangixalus" frogs: they have folds in their skin by their legs and tarsal projections. Scientists are not sure these species really should be in "Zhangixalus".
There are 41 species in this genus:

The AmphibiaWeb recognizes the same species except "Zhangixalus amamiensis", which is treated as being part of "Zhangixalus viridis".

Chislobog

Chislobog (Числобог) is a figure from modern Slavic paganism, especially in the Ynglist tradition. He is typically associated with time and/or numbers, and his name comes from the Slavic words for "number" (число, chislo) and "god" (бог, bog).

Chislobog's origins are uncertain, but he appears in the Book of Veles, a book that is believed to be a forgery rather than a genuine ancient Slavic text. Despite this, he is an important figure in Ynglism and is worshipped by followers of the tradition.

According to Ynglist belief, Chislobog controls the flow of time, sometimes symbolized as a river. He is also considered the protector of various Slavic-Aryan calendars, including the Daa'ri calendar. Ynglists believe that the Daa'ri calendar was used in Europe prior to the adoption of the Christian calendar.

Chislobog is often depicted holding a sword in his left hand, symbolizing protection and preservation, and a shield with the Daa'ri calendar inscribed on it in his right hand. The hymn of Chislobog praises him as the protector of life and the giver of understanding to humans, and asks for blessings for Ynglist families and long life.

While some people have suggested that Chislobog may be female, this is not a widely held belief among Ynglists.

Political union

A political union is a type of political entity. They are usually made up of smaller polities. These smaller administrative divisions are usually called federated states and federal territories in a federal government. In a centralized government, they are often prefectures, regions or provinces. This form of government may be created by cession. This is usually called "unionism." The United Kingdom is an example of this unionism. In other cases, it may come from political unification. This involves coercion and conquest. If states were separated after being a single states, putting them back together would be "reunification". This happened when East and West Germany joined back together as Germany. The individual constituent entities may have devolution of powers but they must still follow the rules of a central government. In a federalised system, the constituent entities usually have internal autonomy. For example, they normally have the power to setup their own police departments. They normally give the federal government power in many areas. These often include military forces and foreign affairs. The union is seen by other countries as a single political entity.

Modern system of ranked Shinto shrines

The modern system of ranked Shinto shrines, is a system of ranking shinto shrines that was used in the Japanese Empire to determine how much money it gave the shtinres. It was an intrinsic part of Japanese .

This system classified Shinto shrines into two categories: official government shrines and "other" shrines.The official shrines were divided into 
Some shrines are the "first shrines" called "ichinomiya" that have the highest rank in their respective provinces of Japan.

The Ise Grand Shrine stood at the top of all shrines and thus was outside the classification.

All listed shrines on this page with the exception of Ise Grand Shrine and others noted in the notes are Beppyo shrines

On May 14th, 1871, the issued a decree establishing the modern shrine system. This system ranked Shinto shrines hierarchically and specified the levels of priests who could officiate at each level of shrine. However, these rankings were abolished in 1946 when they were considered "" by the Occupation . The currently maintains a slightly different list of Special Shrines known as Beppyo shrines

The Kan-sha system, which referred to official government shrines, had two subcategories - Kanpei-sha, also known as government shrines, and Kokuhei-sha, which were national shrines.".
In 1871, the Japanese government created the Kanpei-sha system to group Shinto shrines according to their relationship with the imperial family. The topmost category comprised of shrines that honored imperial family members, emperors, or those who served the imperial family well. These shrines were viewed as the ones most connected to the imperial family and were backed by the government...

The Kanpei-taisha were the most highly ranked shrines in Japan that were officially designated by the government. There were 67 shrines that held this status, which were closely associated with the imperial family. These shrines were considered to be of great historical and cultural significance, and were often visited by members of the imperial family as well as the general public.
The middle-level Imperial shrines were called Kanpei-chūsha (官幣中社) and there were 23 of them. They were not as important as the highest-ranked shrines and didn't get as much money from the government...

There were five shrines that had the lowest rank among the Imperial shrines, and they were known as Kanpei-shōsha (官幣小社).
After the creation of the officially ranked Imperial shrines, another group of special shrines known as Bekkaku kanpeisha (別格官幣社) was established. These shrines were not included in the ranking system of the Imperial shrines, but they were still considered to be of imperial status.
The Kokuhei-sha (国幣社) classified the government-supported shrines in a hierarchy, based on their national significance. The kokuheisha, on the other hand, were shrines that enshrined local kami considered beneficial to their respective areas.

The six most highly ranked, nationally significant shrines or Kokuhei Taisha (国幣大社) were considered the top tier of the national shrines.

The mid-range of ranked, nationally significant shrines or encompassed 47 sanctuaries.

There are 50 nationally significant shrines that are classified as Kokuhei Shōsha, which are the lowest ranked shrines in the modern system of ranked Shinto shrines.
Gokoku shrines were ranked separately They were considered branches of Yasukuni Shrine. This list only includes those which are currently ranked as Beppyo shrines
The or various smaller shrines ranking below these two levels of "Kan-sha" ("official government shrines") are commonly, though unofficially, referred to as "people's shrines" or . These lower-ranking shrines were initially subdivided by the proclamation of the fourteenth day of the fifth month of 1871 into four main ranks, "Metropolitan", "Clan" or "Domain", "Prefectural", and "District" shrines. By far the largest number of shrines fell below the rank of District shrine. Their status was clarified by the of the fourth day of the seventh month of 1871, in accordance with which "Village shrines" ranked below their respective "District shrines", while the smaller local shrines or "Hokora" ranked beneath the "Village shrines".

Here is a non-exhaustive list of shrines under each categorization. This list only includes ones now listed as .

"Metropolitan shrines" were known as . "Prefectural shrines" were known as . At a later date, the "Prefectural shrines" were classed together with the "Metropolitan shrines" as "Metropolitan and Prefectural Shrines" or .
"Clan shrines" or "Domain shrines" were known as . Due to the , no shrines were ever placed in this category.

"District shrines" were known as .
"Village shrines" were known as and ranked below their respective "District shrines", in accordance with the District Shrine Law of 4 July 1871.
Small local shrines known as are ranked beneath the village shrines, in accordance with the District Shrine Law of 4 July 1871. At a later date, shrines beneath the rank of "Village shrines" were classed as "Ungraded shrines" or .
New shrines were established and existing shrines promoted to higher ranks at various dates, but a 1903 snapshot of the 193,297 shrines in existence at that time saw the following:

Circular reasoning

Circular reasoning (, "circle in proving"; also known as circular logic) is a logical fallacy. With this fallacy, the reasoner begins with what they are trying to end with. Circular reasoning is not a formal logical fallacy, but a pragmatic defect in an argument. In this fallacy, the premises need to be proved the same way as the conclusion. In a normal argument, the premises do not need to be proved. Since the premises also need to be proved, the argument does not persuade. There is no reason to accept the premises unless a person already believes the conclusion, or that the premises provide no independent ground or evidence for the conclusion. Circular reasoning is closely related to begging the question, and in modern usage the two generally refer to the same thing.

Circular reasoning is often of the form: "A is true because B is true; B is true because A is true." Circularity can be difficult to detect if it involves a longer chain of propositions.

The dark green round fruit, when fully ripe, is around the size of a tennis ball. The young fruit is often harvested before it is fully ripe when it has a softer flavor.

Gem squash is grown a lot in South Africa, and is usually served as a vegetable, often boiled or baked.

Fuyo Jingu

Buyeo was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Baekje, which had a historical relationship with Japan. The Fuyo Jingu shrine was planned to be built in Buyeo as a symbol of Japan's permanent control over Korea. The shrine was intended to mark the incorporation of Korea into Japan.

Four kami (spirits or deities) were meant to be enshrined at Fuyo Jingu: Emperor Ojin (also known as Hachiman), Empress Kōgyoku, Emperor Tenji, and Empress Jingu. These deities were all associated with the conquest of Korea. According to legend, Empress Jingu delayed giving birth to her child in order to lead a military campaign to conquer Korea.

Kanasana Shrine

Kanasana Shrine (金鑚神社) is a Shinto shrine in Kodama County, Saitama Prefecture. It is a Ninomiya, or a second rank shrine in its province after the Ichinomiya, and is commonly called "Ninomiya-sama"

On November 23rd every year, Kanasana Jinja hosts a festival called Hikiri Shinji, which is also known as the "firestone festival"

Kanasana Jinja is generally built in a mixed architectural style, which combines elements from different architectural styles. 

Kanasana Jinja doesn't have a main hall (honden) because the mountain behind the shrine is considered its shintai, or the physical object or natural element where the kami (deity) resides. Similar to Ōmiwa Shrine, Kanasana Jinja relies on a kannabi, which is a location that serves as a symbol of the kami's presence.

Kanasana Jinja has a large camphor tree shinboku on its premises that is considered a national treasure.

Probation

In many countries, judges have the option of putting someone on probation. Instead of serving time in jail, the person will be ordered to follow certain rules, and his or her behaviour will be monitored. This monitoring is only done for a certain amount of time. If the convicted person does not break the rules, while being monitored he or she can avoid another, harsher sentence (for example: spending time in prison). In general, sentences on probation are used for people who committed a crime for the first time, and for crimes that are seen as "less serious".

Probation is also used for people released from prison to help them get back into a normal life. These people might have been released on parole

Common rules are to keep away from certain people, for example in the case of domestic violence or to not work with children, in the case of child abuse. Other rules are that people on probation need to have a job, and they must tell the court where they live. In many cases electronic tags are used, to track where people are. The rules can be both that the person needs to do certain things, and also that he or she must not do other things. 

There are also cases where the verdict specifies that part of the sentence is "on probation": If the sentence is one year in prison, the court may for example say: three months in prison, and nine months on probation.

Equity (finance)

In finance, equity is an ownership of property that may be affected by debts or future events tied to the property, which are called liabilities. It is measured by subtracting liabilities from the value of the assets owned. For example, if someone owns a car worth $24,000 and owes $10,000 on the loan used to buy the car, the difference of $14,000 is equity. Equity can apply to a single asset, such as a car or house, or to an entire business. A business that needs to start up or expand can sell its equity in order to raise cash. People who buy a house with a mortgage have equity if the value of the house is worth more than the mortgage. If the mortage is more than the property is worth they are said to have negative equity.

Thames sailing barge

A Thames sailing barge is a type of commercial sailing boat once common on the River Thames. They are flat-bottomed barges, adapted to the Thames Estuary, which is not deep and has narrow tributary rivers. The larger barges could be taken on the sea, and were the largest sailing vessel to be handled by just two men. The average size was about 120 tons and they carried 4,200 square feet (390 m) of canvas sail in six working sails. They carried heavy cargo to English ports and to Europe. At first they were all made of wood, but some later ones were made of steel. They were about 20 feet wide and 80 or 90 feet long with two masts.

In the 1860s barge races were started, and the barges' design improved as they were built with better lines in order to win. The Thames barge races are the world's second oldest sailing competition, second to the America's Cup.

Bowling average

In cricket, a player's bowling average is the number of runs for each wicket taken. The lower the bowling average is, the better the bowler is performing. It is one of a number of statistics used to compare bowlers. It is not used for bowlers who have not played a lot.

During the 17th century, the navy of the Dutch Republic (1581–1795) was one of the most powerful naval forces in the world and played an active role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, the Franco-Dutch War, and wars against Spain and several other European powers. The Batavian Navy of the later Batavian Republic (1795–1806) and the Kingdom of Holland (1806–1810) played an active role in the Napoleonic Wars.

In the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands, it served an important role in protecting Dutch colonial rule, especially in Southeast Asia. It played a minor role in World War II, especially against the Imperial Japanese Navy. Since World War II, the Royal Netherlands Navy has taken part in peacekeeping expeditions.

The main naval base is in Den Helder, North Holland.

Batavian Republic

The Batavian Republic came after the Dutch Republic was invaded by the French Republic. It was announced on 19 January 1795 and ended on 5 June 1806, when Louis Bonaparte took the Dutch throne. From October 1801 onward, it was called the "Batavian Commonwealth". It was named after the Batavi, an ancient Germanic tribe.

Polish Navy

The Polish Navy is the naval branch of the Polish Armed Forces. The Polish Navy has 46 ships and about 12,000 people. 

In the fifteenth century there was a small force of ships that primarily operated on rivers and lakes. In 1454, the city of Gdańsk was back in Poland after being previously occupied by the Teutonic Knights since 1308. Gdańsk is a seaport so Poland could have a large fleet on the Baltic. In 1561, following a victory over a Russian fleet in the Baltic, the Polish Navy got a second port at Riga, in modern-day Latvia. The Polish navy won the Battle of Oliwa in 1627 against the Swedish Empire, during the Polish–Swedish War. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth never really had a strong navy.

Józef Piłsudski, commander of the Armed Forces of Poland, founded the modern Polish Navy in 1918.

In World War II three ships sailed to the British naval base at Leith in Scotland in 1939 to escape from the German navy. The British lent them more ships. 

During the Communist period, Poland's navy got much stronger. A separate force of Polish Marines started. The Navy also got Soviet-made ships, including 2 destroyers, 2 missile destroyers, 13 submarines and 17 missile boats to control the Baltic Sea.

Poland joined NATO in 1999 and this changed the work of the navy.

Izumo-taisha

Izumo-taisha, also known as Izumo Grand Shrine or Izumo Ōyashiro, is one of the oldest and most important Shinto shrines in Japan. Its exact establishment date is unknown. Located in Izumo, Shimane Prefecture, the shrine is dedicated to the gods , who is known as the Shinto deity of marriage, and Kotoamatsukami, a group of heavenly deities. The shrine is famous for two major festivals held there. Many people believe that it is the oldest Shinto shrine in Japan, even older than the Ise Grand Shrine.

Izumo-taisha's main hall, called taisha-zukuri, is a style of architecture that takes its name from the shrine. The main hall and the attached buildings were designated National Treasures of Japan in 1952. According to tradition, the hall was once much taller than it is now. The discovery of the remains of enormous pillars in 2000 supports this tradition.

To maintain the power of the "kami" and preserve architectural techniques, Izumo-taisha has been rebuilt every 60 to 70 years. This process of regular rebuilding is called "Sengū" (遷宮) and is also practiced at other important Shinto shrines, such as the Ise Grand Shrine, which is rebuilt every 20 years.

The maritime traditions go back to the 9th century when the Vikings had small but well-organised fleets.

From 1509 to 1814, when Denmark was in a union with Norway, the Danish Navy was part of the Dano-Norwegian Navy. It was an important force then. It played an important part in the colonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. During the Napoleonic Wars the British were afraid that the Danish navy would be used against them. They attacked it in 1801 and captured it in 1807. It took a long time to rebuild the navy. 

In World War II 32 ships were deliberately sunk in 1943 to prevent the Germans from using them.

During the Cold War, the Danish navy was rebuilt and modernised. The main job was to repel a possible invasion from the Warsaw Pact. Now there are fewer but larger vessels able to operate for long periods at sea. 

Royal Thai Navy

It runs three naval area commands: Northern Gulf of Thailand; Southern Gulf of Thailand; and the Andaman Sea. 

The ancient naval arm of the army was mostly river craft whose job was to control the Chao Phraya River and protect ships carrying the army to battle. The warships carried up to 30 musketeers, a large number of rowers and either 6 or 12-pounder cannons or no guns at all.

There are now 130 ships.

The Battle of Narvik, one of the first sea battles of World War II began on April 8, 1940. On June 7, 1940, thirteen ships, five aircraft and 500 men from the Royal Norwegian Navy followed the King of Norway to the United Kingdom and continued the fight from bases there until the war ended.

Myojin Taisha shrines are found throughout Japan, particularly in the Kyoto-Osaka region, including Yamashiro, Yamato, Ōmi, Mutsu, Tajima, and Kii provinces. There are 224 shrines that enshrine 310 kami listed as Myojin Taisha in the Engishiki Jinmyocho. Additionally, there are 203 shrines with 285 kami listed for Myojinsai or "festivals for famed deities" in book 3 of Engishiki. While most of the shrines in these two listings overlap, there are some differences in names and numbers. There are several theories about these differences, but it is unclear why the lists differ.

A related list is the Kokushi genzaisha which refers to shrines which appear in the Rikkokushi (六国史) but not in the Engishiki

Edith Frank

Edith Frank (; 16 January 1900 – 6 January 1945) was the mother of Holocaust diarist Anne Frank, and her older sister Margot. After the family were discovered in hiding in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation, she was transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp.

Edith was the youngest of four children, having been born into a German Jewish family in Aachen, Germany. Her father, Abraham Holländer (1860–1928) was a successful businessman in industrial equipment who was active in the Aachen Jewish community together with Edith's mother, Rosa Holländer (1866–1942). Edith had two older brothers, Julius (1894–1967) and Walter (1897–1968), and an older sister, Bettina. Bettina died at the age of 16 from appendicitis when Edith was 14. Both Julius and Walter immigrated to the United States, surviving afterwards.

She met Otto Frank in 1924 and they married on his 36th birthday, 12 May 1925, at Aachen's synagogue. They had two daughters born in Frankfurt: Margot (born 16 February 1926) and Anne (born 12 June 1929). At the time Anne was born, the family lived in a house at Marbachweg 307 in Frankfurt-Dornbusch, where they rented two floors. Her daughters played almost every day in the garden with the children in the neighborhood. They all had different backgrounds; Catholic, Protestant or Jewish. They shared a curiosity about each other's religious holidays. Margot was invited to the communion celebration of one of her friends, and the neighbors' children were sometimes invited to the Frank's celebration of Hanukkah. Later the family moved to Ganghoferstrasse 24 in a fashionable liberal area of Dornbusch called the Dichterviertel (Poets' Quarter). Both houses still exist.

The appointment of Adolf Hitler on 30 January 1933, to the position of chancellor in Germany and the following rise of antisemitism and start of discriminatory laws in Germany forced the family to emigrate to Amsterdam in 1933. In the Dutch capital Otto established a branch of his spice and pectin distribution company, called Opekta. Edith found emigration to the Netherlands difficult. The family lived in confined conditions and she had trouble with the new language. She remained in contact with her family and friends in Germany, but also made new friends in Amsterdam, most of them fellow German refugees. Edith became involved in Amsterdam's Liberal Jewish community, and attended synagogue with her oldest daughter regularly. On Friday evenings, the Franks often went to visit German-Jewish friends to eat together, and many Jewish holidays were also celebrated. Edith was an open-minded woman who educated her daughters in a modern way. Her older brothers Walter and Julius immigrated to the United States after 1938, and Rosa Holländer-Stern left Aachen in 1939 to join the Frank family in Amsterdam, where she died in January 1942.

Anne Frank's cousin Bernhard ("Buddy") Elias has said that "Edith never felt well in Holland. Edith was "German", and she missed Germany. She did not learn Dutch very well. She did not feel at home in Amsterdam."

In 1940, the Nazis invaded the Netherlands and began their persecution of the country's Jews. Edith's children were removed from their schools, and her husband Otto Frank was forced by the Germans to give up his companies Opekta and Pectacon. Otto made his businesses look "Aryan" by giving over control to his Dutch colleagues Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler, who helped the family when they went into hiding at the company premises on 6 July 1942.

The two-year period the Frank family spent in hiding with four other people (their friends Hermann van Pels, his wife Auguste van Pels and his son Peter van Pels, and Miep Gies's dentist Fritz Pfeffer) was recorded in Anne Frank's posthumously published diary. The diary ended three days before they were anonymously betrayed and arrested on 4 August 1944. After detainment in the Gestapo headquarters on the Euterpestraat and three days in prison on the Amstelveenseweg, Edith and those with whom she had been in hiding were transported to the Westerbork transit camp. From there, they were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp on 3 September 1944, on the last train to be sent from Westerbork to Auschwitz.

Edith and her daughters were separated from Otto when they arrived, and they never saw him again. Edith looked for ways of keeping her children alive. Survivors later described them as an inseparable trio. On 30 October, another selection separated Edith from Anne and Margot. Edith was selected for the gas chambers, and her daughters were transported to Bergen-Belsen. Edith escaped with a friend to another section of the camp, where she remained through the winter. Edith became very ill and was taken to the sick barracks, where she died of weakness and disease on 6 January 1945, three weeks before the Red Army liberated the camp and 10 days before her 45th birthday. Her daughters outlived her by one month.

Otto Frank was the only member of his family who survived the Holocaust and returned to Amsterdam in June 1945. One of the helpers, Miep Gies, gave him Anne's diary papers. She had saved parts of them, just like the other female secretary, Bep Voskuijl.


Kaijin Shrine

Kaijin Shrine (海神神社) is a significant Shinto shrine located in Tsushima Island, Nagasaki that holds a Beppyo status.

He was the first Labour cabinet minister, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1934 and, uniquely, served three separate terms as Leader of the Labour Party in three different decades. He was popular among his colleagues, who called him "Uncle Arthur".

He was born in Glasgow, His father was a textile worker who died when Arthur was ten years old. The Hendersons then moved to Newcastle upon Tyne. When he was 12 he worked as an apprentice at Robert Stephenson and Sons' General Foundry Works until he was 17. Then he moved to Southampton for a year and then returned to work as an iron moulder.

In 1892 he was elected as a paid organiser for the Friendly Society of Iron Founders. He was involved in setting up the Labour Representation Committee in 1900. In 1903, he was elected Treasurer of the Committee and was also elected as Member of Parliament for Barnard Castle at a by-election. From 1903 to 1904, Henderson he was also mayor of Darlington.

In 1908 he was elected Leader of the Labour Party. He resigned in 1910. In 1914 he was elected leader again when Ramsay MacDonald resigned. In 1915, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's created a coalition government, Henderson became the first member of the Labour Party to become a member of the Cabinet, as President of the Board of Education. In 1916, David Lloyd George forced Asquith to resign and replaced him as Prime Minister. Henderson became a member of the small War Cabinet with the post of Minister without Portfolio. He resigned on 11 August 1917 after his proposal for an international conference on the war was rejected by the rest of the Cabinet.

In 1918 he concentrated on building up the membership and organisation of the Labour Party. Henderson lost his seat parliament in the "Coupon Election" of 14 December 1918 which was a landslide victory for a coalition formed by Lloyd George. Henderson returned to Parliament in 1919 after winning a by-election in Widnes. He then became Labour's Chief Whip. 

Henderson lost his seat again, at the general election of 1922. He returned to Parliament via another by-election, this time representing Newcastle East, but again, he was unseated at the general election of 1923.

In 1929 MacDonald appointed Henderson as Foreign Secretary. 

MacDonald formed an emergency National Government in 1931 with members from all parties. MacDonald was expelled from the Labour Party. Henderson accepted the leadership of the main Labour Party and led it into the general election on 27 October against the cross-party National coalition. It was a disastrous result for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52. MacDonald won the largest landslide in British electoral history. Henderson lost his seat, at Burnley. The following year, he resigned the party leadership.

Henderson returned to Parliament after winning a by-election at Clay Cross in 1933. He was elected a total of five times at by-elections in constituencies where he had not previously been the MP. He holds the record for the greatest number of comebacks from losing a previous seat. 

Henderson spent the rest of his life trying to halt the gathering storm of World War II. He worked with the World League of Peace and chaired the Geneva Disarmament Conference, and in 1934 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood

Edgar Algernon Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, CH, PC, QC (14 September 1864 – 24 November 1958), known as Lord Robert Cecil from 1868 to 1923, was a British lawyer, politician and diplomat.

Gion worship

Gion worship, or Gion shinkō in Japanese, is a form of Shintoism that used to center around the deity Gozu Tenno. However, during the Meiji era when there was a separation of Shintoism and Buddhism, the Japanese government required that the focus of Gion worship shift to the deity Susanoo.

The primary shrines of the Gion faith are Yasaka Shrine located in Kyoto and Hiromine Shrine in Hyogo Prefecture..
Gozu Tenno was a deity originally rooted in Buddhist-style Onmyōdō and is believed to have served as the guardian deity of Jetavana, the monastery where Buddha is believed to have studied. In China, Gozu Tenno was influenced by Taoism, and in Japan, he merged with Susanoo, the Shinto Kami. Both Gozu Tenno and Susanoo were considered plague gods, which led to their association. In Japan, Gozu Tenno was also believed to be the Buddha Bhaisajyaguru. The description of Gozu Tenno in Shinnaiden is particularly prominent.

The Gion faith originated in the Heian period with the purpose of preventing epidemics by pacifying the god of pestilence. In the late 10th century, people in Kyoto started holding an annual festival at Yasaka Shrine (then known as Gion Shrine), which eventually became the famous Gion festival. By the Middle Ages, the Gion faith had spread throughout Japan, and Gion shrines or Gyozo tenno shrines were established to enshrine Gyozo tenno. The Goryokai or Tenno Festival was held as a ritual procession during this time.

During the Meiji era, the government implemented a policy of separating Shinto and Buddhism, known as Shinbutsu Bunri. As a result, many Shinto shrines that had previously been associated with Buddhist practices and deities were forced to disassociate themselves from Buddhism. In the case of the Gion Shrine and the Gozu Tenno Shrine, they had to change their names and say Gozu tenno was Susanoo. This was a part of a larger effort to promote Shinto as the national religion of Japan and distance it from foreign influences, particularly Buddhism..

While the worship of Susanoo is often associated with the Gion faith and its origin in the Gozu Tenno deity, there are also many other shrines that worship Susanoo in their own independent traditions. Some of these shrines, such as Susa Shrine and Yaegaki Shrine, have been worshipping Susanoo for centuries before the practice of worshipping Gozu Tenno was prohibited. These shrines have their own unique practices and beliefs, separate from the Gion faith.

There are many Gion shrines. Yasaka Shrine being the most prominent

Yield sign

In road transport, a yield or give way sign indicates that merging drivers must prepare to stop if necessary to let a driver on another approach proceed. A driver who stops or slows down to let another vehicle through has yielded the right of way to that vehicle. In contrast, a stop sign requires each driver to stop completely before proceeding, whether or not other traffic is present. Under the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, the international standard for the modern sign is an inverted equilateral triangle with a red border and either a white or yellow background. Particular regulations regarding appearance, installation, and compliance with the signs vary by some jurisdiction.

Kannabi

In Shinto, there is a concept known as Kannabi (神奈備), also referred to as kaminabi or kamunabi, which denotes a region that houses a kami or is itself a shintai (a repository in which a kami resides).

Kannabi can have sacred trees called shinboku or rocks called Iwakura. Kannabi may also have shimenawa, torii gates, and sandō which show the way to them.
Shrines that worship kannabi do not always have a honden or haiden like other shrines. Instead, they enshrine the natural kannabi as deities. One example is Ōmiwa Shrine. Kanasana Jinja is another shrine where the mountain itself is the shintai.

Chōkai (鳥海) is the name of the nearby Mount Chōkai, while Gassan (月山) is the name of the nearby Mount Gassan. Ryōshō (両所) means "two places", and gū (宮) means "shrine". This means that the name can be translated to "The Shrine of Two Places, Mount Chōkai and Mount Gassan". The name reflects the shrine's importance in the local Shinto tradition, as it is dedicated to the kami (gods) believed to protect both Mount Chōkai and Mount Gassan.

It enshrines the deities Kuninotokotachi no Mikoto of Ōmonoimi-jinja (Mount Chōkai) and Tsukuyomi of Gassan Shrine (Mount Gassan). 



Iwakura

People in Japan have been practicing nature worship for a very long time. This means they believe that gods and spirits live in nature. In Shinto ceremonies, they believe the gods come from a special rock called shintai. They use a special object called yorishiro, which represents the gods' power and is placed at the center of the ceremony.

As time went by and temples became more permanent, the focus of worship shifted from the body of the gods to the shrines themselves. Sacred trees and stones, decorated with shimenawa ropes, can still be found in many temple grounds.

Alongside the belief in rocks, Japan also has various other forms of nature worship. For instance, Chinju no Mori is a belief where certain areas are considered forbidden and off-limits. Munakata Taisha's Okinoshima is another example of a sacred island where the spirits of ancestors are believed to reside. Additionally, there are mountain worships, such as Rokko Himei Shrine and Mount Miwa, as well as beliefs in natural elements like fire, waterfalls, wind, rain, and lightning.

Another rock-related object in Shinto is called Iwasaka, which is believed to be a ritual site that centers on a rock. However, compared to Iwaza, there is little evidence of its existence. The Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) distinguishes Iwasaka from Iwaza, suggesting that it is a distinct object. Additionally, a banjiki is similar to a stone circle and serves as a boundary that marks the divine realm and preserves the sacredness of the site.

Along the Kaido, some megaliths have carvings related to Buddhism, while others have legends associated with them, such as the tale of a famous samurai who bridged horses. The Iwakura Gakkai research group believes that the worship of rock formations and megaliths can be traced back to the Jomon period. They argue that some rock formations were artificially arranged to represent certain figures, directions, or even the shape of a constellation. However, the Iwakura Society disputes this view, stating that the Iwakura ritual did not begin until the Kofun period. Additionally, there is criticism of the idea that megaliths are human-made artifacts.
An iwasaka is a type of stone altar or mound used in ancient Shinto practices as a yorishiro, or an object used as a dwelling place for a kami, or a god or spirit. The purpose of an iwasaka is to call upon the kami for worship. The words iwasaka and iwakura are often used interchangeably since their meanings are very similar.



Shinboku

A , which means "god tree" in English, is a tree or forest that is worshipped as a physical object of worship at or near a Shinto shrine. It is believed to be a repository in which spirits or reside. Shinboku are often wrapped in , which makes them distinctly visible.

The term "goshingi" refers to trees that are considered sacred or divine within the grounds of Shinto shrines and jingū of Shinto. This term also includes the surrounding forests, as well as trees that are not intended for logging. Goshingi also refers to trees that are owned by shrines or individuals and have a special significance in folklore. Additionally, it may refer to trees that have been deliberately cut down and used as timber for building shrines or left to grow naturally.

Nature worship, also called Himikura Shinto, is a component of the traditional Shinto religion that emerged in Japan. This form of worship is founded on appreciation, awe, and reverence for kami (spirits or deities), life, and the natural world. In ancient Shinto rituals, symbolic items such as trees were utilized as vessels for Shinto deities in areas where the environment underwent changes.

For many years, Shinto shrines and rituals have been shaped by foreign religions and evolved independently, resulting in a variety of Shinto forms. Japan now has tens of thousands of Shinto shrines, with many built on the grounds of ancient Shinto shrines. These shrines may include sacred trees, iwakura, rock formations, steles, or mounds, representing Japan's history of nature worship.

Some shrines in Shinto worship a sacred tree instead of having a physical structure. In Shinto rituals, evergreen trees with pointed branches, known as tamagushi, are used as a substitute for the gods to descend from. The most popular type of tamagushi is the sakaki tree, but other species such as hisakaki and ogatama no ki are used in regions where sakaki does not grow naturally (areas north of the Kanto region).

In general, a "tadakushi" refers to a branch that has been cut down to be offered to the gods, while a "sacred tree" is a tree that is still rooted in the earth and worshipped by many people.
Kami-yorigi, also called kanjinboku, are objects that serve as a dwelling place for the gods and are given special treatment by being decorated with shimenawa. The Nageia nagi tree is one example of a yorishiro that is also adorned with shimenawa. Common types of yorishiro include the Nageia nagi tree, mochinoki tree, and cedar tree.

Some trees are also treated as sacred trees for their own sake, such as the cedar trees at Ise Grand Shrine. These trees are considered special and separate from the gods, and are preserved to maintain the shrine's natural scenery and solemn atmosphere. In addition, those who work in the mountains may temporarily enshrine a tree that stands out as a substitute for the god of the mountain.

The gohei is a special item used in Shinto ceremonies. It's made from sakaki and nagi, and is sometimes referred to as a sacred tree. However, it was originally created as a replacement for a real sacred tree in ancient Shinto practices.

In old Shinto times, people believed that Shinto shrines were where the gods lived or where the present world and the everlasting world met. They were respected and feared. To make it difficult for bad things, gods, and people to enter and leave easily, shimenawa were hung as barriers, making it a forbidden area. Even now, there are many places such as Okinoshima Island where not only the shrine, sacred tree, or forest of the local guardian are prohibited, but the entire island is. Sometimes, for a specific time period, rituals and festivals are held to invite the gods and bring good fortune.


Whale mounds

Whale mounds, also known as Kujira Tsuga in Japanese, are mounds that are dedicated to whales that have been washed up on the shore. This is a unique custom to Japan.

Mounds are created to remember Cetacean stranding, a type of whale that was hunted for food and resources, and to show appreciation for the area being saved and enriched. Whales were considered gods and some were called Ebisu, so they were enshrined to prevent them from becoming angry gods after they died on the shore or were hunted. The mound is also built to prevent the god from becoming angry. These mounds can be found at Toda Shrine in Shinagawa, Tokyo and Whale Shrine in Miyake-jima, Tokyo.

After organized whaling was established during the Edo period, mounds were also built in areas where whaling was a livelihood to serve as memorials and expressions of gratitude. Examples include the Ryujima area near Ukishima Shrine in Chiba Prefecture and Taiji.

People believed that whales had spiritual power as their arrival in an area often coincided with the arrival of fish. Therefore, they were used as fishing guides and regarded as auspicious. This led to the enshrinement of whales, often in the form of Ebisu, as a fishing deity to bring good fortune to fishermen and as a sea god to pray for safety at sea.

Similarly, there are whale graves and monuments in areas where whaling has been a source of livelihood since ancient times, as well as for passive and accidental whaling. When combined with whale mounds, there are about 100 of them in Japan.

A whalebone torii is a type of torii where the gate of the shrine is constructed using whale bones, primarily the ribs of the whale.

The oldest one in Japan is the torii of the Ebisu Shrine in Taiji Town, Wakayama Prefecture. This is mentioned in Ihara Saikaku's "Nihon Eitaigura" published in 1688 (Jōkyō5): "In the village of Taiji, Ominato, Kiiro, the wife and children sing. This place is prosperous and Wakamatsu village is standing. According to records, the current torii is the third generation, and it is unknown what it was made of before that. According to records, the current torii is the third generation, and it is not known what it was made of before that. These are all the whale torii gates that exist in Japan today, but there is also a Cape Eluanbi Shrine in Eluanbi, the southernmost point of Taiwan under Japanese rule at the time. There were also whale torii gates at three other shrines: Fudato Ebisu Shrine in Sakhalin, and Shikotan Shrine on Shikotan Island in the Northern Territories. Each of these five locations is either directly or indirectly related to whaling (such as whaling bases).

Bataan Death March

The Bataan Death March was a forcible transfer by the Imperial Japanese Army of between 75,000 American and Filipino prisoners of war (POW) from the municipalities of Baguc and Mariveles on the Bataan Peninsula to Camp O'Donnel via San Fernando.

The transfer began on 9 April 1942 after the three month Battle of Bataan in the Philippines during World War II. The total distance of Mariveles to San Fernando and from the Capas Train Station to various camps was long. Sources also report widely differing prisoner of war casualties prior to reaching Camp O'Donnell: from 5,000 to 18,000 Filipino deaths and 500 to 650 American deaths during the
march.

The march was characterized by

John Boyd Orr

John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr, CH, DSO, MC, FRS, FRSE (23 September 1880 – 25 June 1971) was a Scottish teacher, medical doctor, biologist, nutritional physiologist, politician, businessman and farmer who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his scientific research into nutrition and his work as the first Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.

He started and was the first President (1960–1971) of the World Academy of Art and Science. In 1945, he was elected President of the National Peace Council and was President of the World Union of Peace Organisations and the World Movement for World Federal Government.

He was born near Kilmarnock, and in 1885 the family moved to West Kilbride. He became a pupil teacher and then studied at the University of Glasgow. His first job as a teacher was in the slums of Glasgow. He was shocked by the condition of the children and left after a few days. He then taught for three years at Kyleshill School in Saltcoats. Then he went back to the university to study biology and medicine. He graduated in 1914.

He got a job as a ship's surgeon and then as a general practitioner, but quickly moved into biological research, working with Edward Provan Cathcart and then moved to a new research institute in Aberdeen to study animal nutrition. This was delayed by the First World War, during which he worked as a doctor caring for the soldiers and spent three months in the naval hospital at Chatham.

He went back to Aberdeen in early 1919 to set up the Rowett Research Institute, named after John Quiller Rowett, who donated a lot of money to it. He set up an experimental farm of around 1,000 acres. He raised a lot of money but later he said, "I still look with bitter resentment at having to spend half my time in the humiliating job of hunting for money for the Institute." He moved from animal nutrition research to human nutrition. In 1927 he proved the value of milk being supplied to school children, which led to free school milk in the UK. His 1936 report ""Food, Health and Income"" showed that at least one third of the UK population were so poor that they could not afford to buy enough food to provide a healthy diet. It showed that there was a link between low-income, malnutrition and children doing badly in schools. 

In October 1945, Orr was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow after standing as an Independent Progressive candidate. He was elected as an independent Member of Parliament for the Combined Scottish Universities in a by-election in April 1945, and kept his seat at the general election shortly after. He resigned in 1946.

After the Second World War, Boyd Orr resigned from the Rowett Institute, and took several posts, most notably as Director-General of the United Nations' new Food and Agriculture Organization.

When he got the Nobel Peace Prize in 1949, he donated the entire financial award to organizations devoted to world peace and a united world government. He was elevated to the peerage in 1949 as Baron Boyd-Orr, of Brechin Mearns in the County of Angus.

In 1960 Boyd Orr was elected the first president of the World Academy of Art and Science, which was set up by eminent scientists of the day concerned about the potential misuse of scientific discoveries, most especially nuclear weapons.

Kokusai himitsu keisatsu series

Kokusai himitsu keisatsu series (国際秘密警察シリーズ, "International Secret Police Series") is an action movie produced by Toho from 1963 to 1967. A total of five films were produced by Toho and stars Tatsuya Mihashi, a look-alike Cary Grant. 

This series was produced in 1963 when the first James Bond film "Dr. No" (directed by Terrence Young) was released and became a hit in Japan. It is said to be "the first spy movie in the world to be influenced by 007". The basic story is that Jiro Kitami, an agent working for the International Secret Police/I.S.P. (国際秘密警察, "Kokusai himitsu keisatsu"), destroys evil organizations, just like the "Japanese James Bond" played by Mihashi. The highlights are the bizarre gadgets used during the missions and his skillful gun handling.

The first work "Interpol Code 8" and the second work "Tiger Fang" were produced as pure spy action movies with a serious mood, but the third work "Director Takashi Tsuboshima" written by Shinichi Sekizawa and directed by Takashi Tsuboshima. From "Keg of Gunpowder" onwards, elements of sex appeal are added and Kitami becomes sloppy with women, the appearance of unrealistic enemy characters, elements of comedy touches is also included. It has become a work of entertainment for audiences looking to watch something different from other film genres they watched like kaiju and tokusatsu.

In 1966, Toho invited American actor and producer Roger Smith, who was also popular in Japan with "77 Sunset Strip", a one-hour TV series planned starring a Japanese-American duo with Mihashi. Although the project fell through with many script changes, Shinichi Sekizawa rewrote the 5th and final film, "The Killing Bottle," by reusing the novel "Desperate Situation" (
絶体絶命, "Zettai zetsumei") written by novelist Michio Tsuzuki for the pilot episode.

Continuous wave

A continuous wave or continuous waveform (CW) is an electromagnetic wave of constant amplitude and frequency, typically a sine wave, that for mathematical analysis is considered to be of infinite duration. It may refer to e.g. a laser or particle accelerator having a continuous output, as opposed to a pulsed output.

By extension, the term "continuous wave" also refers to an early method of radio transmission in which a sinusoidal carrier wave is switched on and off. This is more precisely called interrupted continuous wave (ICW). Information is carried in the varying duration of the on and off periods of the signal, for example by Morse code in early radio. In early wireless telegraphy radio transmission, CW waves were also known as "undamped waves", to distinguish this method from damped wave signals produced by earlier "spark gap" type transmitters.

Three Mountains of Dewa

The Three Mountains of Dewa, also known as Dewa Sanzan in Japanese, are three special mountains situated in the ancient Dewa Province of Yamagata Prefecture. The three mountains are Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan, and Mount Yudono. These mountains are considered sacred in the Shinto religion and are particularly significant for the Shugendo mountain ascetic cult. Many people, including the well-known haiku poet Matsuo Bashō, visit Dewa Sanzan as a popular pilgrimage site.

The Haguro Five-story Pagoda is a national treasure of Japan.

It has three subshrines


Over 1400 years ago in 593, Prince Hachiko opened the Dewa Sanzan mountains as a religious center, which is now considered the oldest history of mountain worship in Japan. After fleeing the Soga clan upon the killing of his father, Emperor Sushun, Prince Hachiko arrived in Dewa province, where he devoted the rest of his life to religious pursuits. He endured difficult ascetic exercises and a period of penance, leading to his worship of Haguro Gongen, the mountain deity. The prince began worshiping at the Gassan and Yudono mountains, leading to the enshrinement of all three deities at the temple on the peak of Mount Haguro.

People started to visit Dewa Sanzan mountains regularly after it was established as a place for religious beliefs. They would sometimes travel thousands of miles during the summer months to pay their respects at the shrines. The mountains were important to many religions and were a place of learning for various belief systems, but especially for shugendō. Famous people like En no Gyōja, who created shugendō asceticism, and Kūkai, who founded the Shingon Sect, made the pilgrimage to Dewa Sanzan.

After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan's government decided to separate Shinto and Buddhism, making Shinto the official state religion. This affected shugendo negatively, and many of its priests left their religious life. After World War II, shugendo regained its status as a minor religious group. These changes also affected the Dewa Sanzan shrines' designations. In the Empire of Japan, Hagurosan Shrine and Yudonosan Shrine were designated as kokuhei shosha, while Gassan Shrine on Mount Gassan was considered a kanpei taisha. Today all three are considered equal Beppyo shrines

Folk religion has been a significant part of the daily lives of Japanese people for a long time. One of its prominent aspects is the connection between religious beliefs and practices with sacred mountains. Mountain worship is a widespread practice in Japan, and it has been observed that almost every high mountain top has had its own dedicated shrine at some point. Many of these shrines receive thousands of worshippers each year for annual pilgrimages. This combination of religious practices and beliefs associated with sacred mountains is known as sangaku shinkō.

The Dewa Sanzan are considered very holy in both Shinto and Buddhism religions, but especially important to the Shugendo religious beliefs. Each of the three sacred mountains, Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan, and Mount Yudono, has its own shrine, but the main Dewa Shrine is situated at the top of Mount Haguro. What makes the primary shrine unique is that it honors all three of the sacred mountains.

Each year, lay practitioners of shugendo, known as yamabushi, pay homage to the Dewa Sanzan. Mount Haguro is particularly important in this practice as it serves as the gateway to Mount Gassan and Mount Yudono.

Mount Haguro, despite being the smallest of the three Dewa mountains, is unique in that it remains accessible year-round unlike Mount Gassan and Mount Yudono, which are closed during winter due to heavy snowfall. As a result, it is the most renowned mountain of the three, and is well-known locally and internationally. One of Japan's national treasures, the Haguro Five-story Pagoda, is situated on Mount Haguro. is its shrine, and also called Dewa Shrine

Mount Gassan is the tallest of the three sacred mountains and is famous for its natural scenery and beauty. It is home to many rare alpine plants and other marsh vegetation. The hiking path to the peak of Mt. Gassan is the second-highest point in the Shonai Region of Japan. However, due to heavy snowfall, the mountain is usually accessible only from late spring to early fall. Gassan Shrine is its shrine

Mount Yudono is the most sacred and significant mountain of the Dewa Sanzan, considered the heart of the three sacred mountains. It is highly regarded as a training ground for ascetic discipline, and many yamabushi and ascetics believe that their pilgrimage is not complete until they reach the summit of Mount Yudono. The mountain is renowned for its goshintai, a sacred object believed to be connected to a god. The shrine on Mount Yudono is regarded as holy ground and is kept secret, with photography and video recordings being strictly prohibited even today. is its shrine.

During the Genpei War, there was fighting in and around Ikuta Shrine. This battle, known as the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani, is commemorated by markers in the forest behind the shrine. However, the shrine's land was much larger in the past, before the city of Kobe was built around it. Because of this, the exact locations of battles and other events can no longer be marked on the shrine's property.

In addition to the three shrines, there are two Buddhist temples, Seiganto-ji and Fudarakusan-ji, that are also part of the Kumano Sanzan complex.

The Kumano region has been significant religiously since ancient times, even before modern religions in Japan. It is known as a place for physical healing. Initially, each Kumano shrine had its own form of nature worship, but in the 10th century, they began to be worshipped together as the three deities of Kumano under the influence of Buddhism.. During the time when Japanese kami were believed to be emanations of buddhas, known as the honji suijaku theory, the three deities of Kumano became associated with Buddhas. Kuniyasutamahime, one of the deities, was associated with Sahasrabhūja Avalokiteśvara (also known as Senju Kannon, meaning "Thousand-Armed Avalokiteśvara"), Bhaisajyaguru (Yakushi Nyōrai), and Amitābha (Amida Nyōrai). The site of Kumano became a unique example of the fusion between Buddhism and Japanese indigenous religion known as shinbutsu-shūgō.. After the three shrines were associated with Buddhism, the Kumano Sanzan site gained popularity and attracted many worshipers, making it a popular pilgrimage destination.. During the 11th century, pilgrims who visited the Kumano Sanzan site were mainly members of the imperial family or aristocrats. However, by the 15th century, the majority of the pilgrims were commoners.. In the past, the pilgrimage to Kumano was also known as the . This was because the pilgrims could be seen walking in long lines, winding through the valleys, and resembling a trail of ants.

Spaghettification

In astrophysics, spaghettification (sometimes referred to as the noodle effect) is the pulling and pushing of objects into long thin spaghetti-like shapes as they go near a strong field of gravity. It is caused by extreme tidal forces. Near a black hole, the pulling and pushing are so powerful that no object can resist it. In a small region, the pushing balances the pulling so that a small object being spaghettified experiences no change in volume.

Stephen Hawking described the flight of a fictional astronaut who was passing within a black hole's event horizon. The astronaut he describes is "stretched like spaghetti" by the difference in gravitational force, or the gradient, from head to toe. The reason this happens is that the gravity force exerted by the singularity would be much stronger at one end of the body than the other. If one were to fall into a black hole feet first, the gravity at their feet would be much stronger than at their head, causing the person to be vertically pulled. Along with that, the right side of the body will be pulled to the left, and the left side of the body will be pulled to the right, pushing the sides of the person inward. Spaghettification of a star was seen for the first time in 2018 by scientists observing a pair of colliding galaxies approximately 150 million light-years from Earth.

Inbe Shrine

Inbe Shrine is a Shinto shrine in Nikenya-cho, Tokushima City, Tokushima Prefecture. It used to be a Myojin Taisha. It is a beppyo shrine under the Association of Shinto Shrines.


Inbe Shrine's deity is believed to be the Oyagami or the ancestor deity of the . The shrine's deity is known to have played a role in the story of Amaterasu Omikami hiding in the cave, where Tentagyoku-no-mikoto led him to plant a tree and make a white coin woven from kozo fibers. The deity is also believed to have introduced cotton (also called Yu) to Japan.

Inbe Shrine was originally in Mashoku County, Awa Province and was listed in the 'Engishiki Jinmyocho' and 'Myojin Taisha Shrine'. However, due to fires and other factors, its location became unknown during the Middle Ages. In the early modern period, multiple shrines were built in Shikinai and Inbe Shrines claiming to be the original Inbe Shrine. In 1871, it was temporarily promoted to Kokuhei Chusha with "location unknown". In 1874, Inbe-jinja Shrine in Yamakawa-cho was replaced by Gosho-jinja Shrine. In 1881, Gosho-jinja Shrine was changed to Shikinaibu-jinja Shrine, but Yamazaki opposed it. In 1885, the current location on the slopes of Mt. Bizan was selected and Kotohira-jinja Shrine was enshrined there. It was moved to Gosho-jinja Shrine as a temporary subsidiary shrine before being relocated to its present location on May 15, 1892, following the completion of the shrine building.

The shrine was built in the year 1892. But during the year 1945, a big part of the main buildings got destroyed because of war-related incidents. To rebuild it, the current main hall was constructed in 1953, which has a 3-bay front and a 2-bay roof on the remaining three sides. To decorate the roof, chigi and bonito were placed on the ridge.

A loom is placed in the weaving hall. There the fabric for imperial succession is woven

Virome

A virome is a collection of viruses found in a biological community, such as an ecosystem or an organism. Scientists studying viruses use gene sequencing methods to study the viruses in these communities and classify them. This is known as the study of metagenomics. Viruses are found in all kinds of environments. One example of a virome is the human virome, which is the community of viruses living in various human organs. Bacteriophages, a type of virus, are the most common type of virus in the biosphere and in humans, and are found in feces, saliva, blood, and more.

In the 2000s, virologist Forest Rohwer performed gene sequencing on samples of seawater, soil, and human tissue. The studies revealed that the gene diversity of viruses globally is massive and mostly unrecorded. More research in the 2010s showed that the gut virome of humans is of special interest in human medicine. Scientists sort nucleic acids from the other components of viruses, and then analyze them. The large number of different viruses on Earth makes completing the Earth’s virome difficult. As of November 2018, a large virus database held information on 760,000 individual viruses and virus parts.

Beppyo shrine

A Beppyo Shrine, or , is a type of Shinto shrine that is considered to be remarkable in some way and thought to be more important than other shrines. This category of shrines was defined by the Association of Shinto Shrines, and it is seen as the successor to the more detailed Modern system of ranked Shinto shrines.

The list is too big to show here, so it only shows a list of important shrines that are not Beppyo shrines. To see a list of Beppyo shrines, please refer to the list in the Modern system of ranked Shinto shrines, which includes all of these shrines plus the ones mentioned below.

The shrines listed below are not Beppyo Shrines because they do not have a strong relationship with the Association of Shinto Shrines. Those whose "Year of termination of umbrella relationship" is 1946 have not been in a close relationship with the Association of Shinto Shrines since it was established in 1946.

Shinko-shiki

Shinko-shiki (神幸式), also known as Shinko-sai (神幸祭) is a shinto ritual of moving a kami in a procession. The Kami's shintai will be removed from the main Shinto shrine and be put in a movable shrine such as Matsuri float or a . It usually takes place during an annual festival for a shrine The parade is considered a way for the kami to review and affirm the boundaries of a neighborhood or parish.

The content, formality, and participation in Shinko Shiki parades vary depending on the region. The most visible part of the parade is a group of marchers who walk or ride along a set route. The parades require organization and resources, and they are often organized as part of a shrine's ritual or related activities.

The parades serve as affirmations of social boundaries because individuals and households contribute time and resources to their neighborhood or area's parade, participate in its organization or performance, and publicly display their membership through signs, posters, or jackets.

This festival can take place on land or water, and the route and places visited are based on tradition. The festival can also include costumes and special rituals. It is sometimes called "O-watari" (お渡り) .

The of is a famous example of Shinko-sai.

Shinko Shiki is specifically associated with the visit of kami to its parishioners, but there is a wide range of performance and interpretation.

For example Tokyo Shinko-shiki is rowdy and has lots of drinking, while in Yuzawa it is quiet and formal.


Zhangixalus franki

Frank's tree frog ("Zhangixalus franki") is a frog. People have seen it in China, in Yunnan Province, and in northern Vietnam. People have seen it between 1320 and 1360 m above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 77.9–85.8 mm long from nose to rear end.

Shinshi

As time passed, people started to connect certain animals with specific shrines. It became a custom to take care of these animals when they were found within the area of the shrine. Normally, each kami had only one animal familiar, but sometimes, there were some exceptions where a kami had more than one. Even some of the "Seven Lucky Gods" like Daikokuten (a mouse) and Benzaiten (a snake) had animal familiars.

In later years, the kami's animal familiar became a common symbol of the kami itself. For instance, the fox at Inari shrines was worshipped as a manifestation of the kami. These creatures were thought to be extraordinary spiritual beings, and this perception, combined with their relationship with the specific kami, likely gave rise to this phenomenon.
It is believed to have originated from shamanism, where animals aided shamans in traveling to the spirit world. Certain animals are associated with particular spirits, such as foxes with Inari and deer with Kasuga.

In the past, tribal communities considered their shaman's animal helper as an ancestor, and this may have influenced the connection between animals and spirits in Shinto. For example, the Kamo tribe believed that the was their ancestor.

At Ise Jingu, roosters roam around and are believed to be the assistants of the sun goddess, Amaterasu. They wake her up every morning, according to folklore. Some experts believe that the rooster may be the bird depicted on the torii, a gate that marks the entrance to a shrine.

Inari Okami's fox messengers are often identified directly with her Rice food sake and other offerings are given to them for her

In a book called Fusō Sakki, which was written in the middle of the Heian period in Japan, it is mentioned that a person who killed a white fox (known as shiratoume) near the Ise Shrine was exiled to that area. This suggests that there was a belief in spiritual foxes in ancient Japan..'

The "Chujin Harai-kun," a book written in the 12th century, states that the kami's messenger is second only to the eight great kami and is subordinate to the 100,000 kami. Moreover, "Kitakami Yuki-fu," an essay written in the early 19th century, explains that a ritual called hanasui-iwai is held every year on January 15th. During this ritual, every new household is given a Shinshi.

Shukubo

In Japan, a Shukubo is a place where visitors can spend the night inside a Buddhist temple. It means "temple lodging" in English. In the past, these facilities were built to house only monks and worshippers. However, nowadays, more and more of them are welcoming general tourists and expanding their facilities and services accordingly. Some temples, such as , have outdoor hot spring baths known as Onsens. These temple lodgings are now somewhat secularized and in many towns, they are the only available accommodation options.

At first, only Buddhist monks called Bhikkhu were permitted to stay at these accommodations. However, during the Heian period, more individuals began to embark on pilgrimages to temples and shrines. As a result, even people like the nobility, samurai, and common pilgrims began to stay in these facilities. As a result, the operators of these facilities were no longer only monks.

Shukubo were historically used by Shugendo practitioners and those who worshipped mountains. They played significant roles in the development of both practices.

In a construction boom that lasted for several decades in the Edo period, networks of Shukubo started to develop in Ise, Shima, Toba, and Futami-ura.

Many of the present-day operators of Shukubo are descendants of families who used to run them when they were solely for religious purposes. These Shukubo were originally intended for only one Kosha, but opening up to the general public has significantly increased the number of people staying at these facilities.

At the base of Mount Haguro, there were once 336 Shukubo, all of which were connected to Shugendo.

During the Edo period, visits to temples and shrines became popular Destinations included those Ise, , and . As a result, lodging houses were constructed at major temples and shrines in each area to accommodate ordinary pilgrims and tourists. This formed an early tourism industry. Specific areas were linked to specific lodging houses.

In modern times, some Shukubo have been transformed into traditional inns and ryokans for tourists who wish to experience the ambiance of a temple stay.

Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark (; born 10 July 1965) is the eldest child of King Constantine II of Greece and Anne-Marie of Denmark, who were King and Queen of Greece from 1964 until the abolition of the monarchy in 1973. She was heiress presumptive to the Greek throne from her birth in 1965 until the birth of her brother Crown Prince Pavlos in 1967.

Alexia was born on 10 July 1965 at Mon Repos, a villa on the Greek island of Corfu used at the time as a summer residence by the Greek royal family.

Halo effect

The halo effect is the effect where one quality about something or someone can affect the overall judgment of that thing or person by someone else. It is a cognitive bias in the field of psychology. It is also sometimes called the halo error. 

The halo effect was first introduced in 1920 by Edward Thorndike. It was used to describe how thoughts about one part of something can change how other parts of that thing are seen. An example is how good someone looks can make people think that the person is good at other things just because they look good. When the halo effect is talked about it is mostly used to talk about how it affects people, but it can be used for things like companies or people of a country 

The halo effect is seen in many different ways. One way it is seen is for trust. People that are better looking are seen as easier to trust. Another way it is seen is with personality. If someone has a bad personality then other things about them start to seem bad. In one study there was a college instructor who spoke English with a European accent. He did an interview with two different groups. In one of them he was friendly and in the other one he was not friendly. The group that he was friendly to said good things about him like saying his appearance and accent was good. The group that he was not friendly to said bad things like his appearance and accent were not things they liked. Interestingly, the group that did not like the instructor thought they didn't like him because of things like appearance and accent. 

The halo effect can affect politics too. People that are seen as more attractive are also seen as smarter when it comes to politics. They are also seen as more persuasive. People are likely to find attractive people to ask about politics. Also, attractive people are more likely to try to persuade people about politics even if they do not know much about it.

Another way the halo effect is seen is in academia. Students that are seen as more attractive are also seen as more intelligent. People also think that students who are more attractive do better in their studies. This can affect the education of students because of the pygmalion effect. The attractive students would get better things and do better in their studies just because they are attractive. This can also affect jobs. Studies have shown that people are more likely to hire an attractive candidate for a job over an unattractive candidate. This is because of the halo effect. The people that are hiring think that the more attractive people will be better at the jobs just because of their appearance. 

Halo effect is also seen with criminals. Criminals that are more attractive are more likely to get less punishment for crimes than criminals that are seen as unattractive. They were less likely to be arrested or convicted. 

Attractive people were also shown to be more successful in influencing others. One study had children try to influence their classmates. They were offered money as a reward so that they would try their best. The attractive males and females were most successful when it came to trying to influence people of the opposite gender. The unattractive males were most succesful when it came to influencing their own gender. 

One study also found that unattractive people were seen as more likely to do bad things that break the rules. Similarly, attractive people were more likely to break the rules to do good things. 

Some people believe there are problems with the halo effect. As an example, one study suggests that the halo effect is not found everywhere. The study says that sometimes people think the halo effect is affecting something when it is not. This is known as illusory halo. Another study suggested that the halo effect can affect times where a student has to give a review of a teacher. The students may rate the teacher badly because of things that are unrelated. However, it says that even if the halo effect is there it does not make the review meaningless.

Another study suggested that the halo effect can support information that is not in the best interest of science. The study used the example of how people that review scientific journals will give better ratings if they belong to the same field of study. This would have the bad effect of not supporting the best quality information. 

Omonoimi no Kami

Matsuri float

A Matsuri float, also known as a dashi or sansha, is a type of float that is either pulled or carried during a festival in Japan. It is a general term used to refer to any float that is used for this purpose.

Dashi are one of three large structures at Japanese festivals alongside Yatai, and Mikoshi.

The terminology used for Matsuri floats can be inconsistent and varies by region in Japan. Some of the most common names used for these floats include Kasaboko, Danjiri, Yamahoko, Yamakasa, and Hikimono. Furthermore, Dashi and Yatai floats are sometimes called hikiyama and yama.

Dashi floats (山車) are an important component of Japanese festivals, and were originally designed to look like mountains. This reflects the concept of Mountain worship, where people believed that spirits resided in the mountains. The spears and swords that adorn the tops of the dashi serve as markers for these divine spirits, and people ride on top of the dashi to help welcome the gods. Dashi have wheels and are pulled by people, and can carry passengers as well.

Mikoshi is used to carry kami in a procession called Shinko-shiki. People carry the Mikoshi on their shoulders, while dashi is pulled by people. People are not allowed to ride on a mikoshi because it is only for gods..

Dashi floats can be seen in many festivals in Japan, such as the Takayama Matsuri in Gifu Prefecture and the Kanda Matsuri in Tokyo. During the Takayama Matsuri, ten dashi floats go through the city in the day and at night. The Kanda Matsuri has both dashi floats and mikoshi, with people wearing traditional clothes walking through the streets.

2011 United Kingdom census

A census of the population of the United Kingdom is taken every ten years. The 2011 census was held in all countries of the UK on 27 March 2011. It was the first UK census which could be completed online. The Office for National Statistics is responsible for the census in England and Wales, the General Register Office for Scotland is responsible in Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency is responsible in Northern Ireland.

The 2011 census for England and Wales included around 25 million households. Forms were posted out to all households, using a national address register compiled by the Office for National Statistics with the help of local authorities. Lockheed Martin was awarded the contract to provide services for the census: printing, a contact centre and data capture and processing. The contract was for £150 million, about one third of the total £482 million cost. Some people called for a boycott of the census over the involvement of Lockheed Martin, but as the Census is used to distribute money to local services a council may lose £22,000 over 10 years for each person who does not complete it.

There were 56 questions. Several were new. It asked immigrants their date of arrival and how long they intended to stay in the UK. There were tick boxes for same-sex civil partnerships.

Yaoyorozu no Kami

Yaoyorozu no Kami (八百万の神, "Eight Million Gods") are gods belonging to the Shinto religion. The phrase "eight million gods" in Shinto religion doesn't mean there are exactly 8 million gods. It means there are too many gods to count. At the time infinity wasn't a known concept. And 8 is a lucky number in Buddhism

This doctrine says there are countless Kami, including those that control natural phenomena such as the ocean, mountains, and wind, as well as those that are closely linked to human life. Ancestors and influential figures who have achieved great things for their communities are also respected as "Kami." Many Shinto customs and stories were documented in Kojiki and Nihon shoki, written records from the Nara Period..

All things, including the Gods, humans, and objects, come from , the first and supreme God. Ame-no-Minakanushi is the source of the universe and life, and is considered the principle of life. Life is at the center of both universal and human doctrines because everything originates from this supreme life. The nature of life is to expand itself. 

Some of the 8 million kami are tutelary deities, but most kami do not receive any worship.

Shinto believes in multiple gods and acknowledges that Kami are present in everything, such as weather, geography, and landscape. Yaoyorozu no Kami describes the numerous gods that exist in the world. These gods are often depicted as having human-like qualities and forms. They are believed to be protector deities that can bring blessings or harm to humans. They are also called "guardian gods" that provide blessings to people, but they can also torture or harass humans. This dual nature of Kami makes them both revered and feared..

The concept that all things are manifestations of the divine in Shinto has resulted in the integration of foreign deities into the religion. As a result, Shinto has incorporated Buddhist and Confucian elements, over time..

Tetromino

A tetromino is a shape made up of four squares directly connected to each other by their edges.

If one considers a tetromino that has been moved (translated), turned (rotated) or flipped (reflected) to be the same shape, there are five distinct tetrominoes. These are known as free tetrominoes.

Tetrominoes are well known for being the game pieces used in the video game "Tetris", which was created by Alexey Pajitnov. "Tetris" uses one-sided tetrominoes, which can be translated and rotated but not reflected. This makes for a total of seven tetrominoes.

It combines beliefs, philosophies, doctrines, and ritual systems from local folk religions, Shinto mountain worship, and Buddhism.

Sorei

Sorei is a Japanese word that means "Founder/Ancestor/Antecedent Spirit". It refers to the spirits of ancestors who have been the subject of special memorial services that are held at fixed times after their death. The specific dates and frequencies of these services vary throughout Japan.. Some suitable occasions for these services are 33 and 50 years after the death of the ancestor.

There is a belief that the memorial services cause the ancestral spirit to gradually lose its individuality and eventually become a part of the collective sorei. However, in some regions, people believe that these services are simply meant to dispose or pacify the ancestral spirit.

According to the folklorist Yanagita Kunio, the rituals and beliefs surrounding sorei suggest that ancestors can become protectors or kami. Many scholars disagree. The Japanese word for the departed soul, hotoke, can also mean Buddha.

Yasaka Shrine

', also known as ', is a shinto shrine located in the Gion District of Kyoto, Japan. It is the central shrine of Gion worship. It sits at the east end of Fourth Avenue and has various buildings such as gates, a main hall, and a stage. The shrine worships Susanoo as its main deity, along with his partner Kushinadahime on the east and eight other gods known as yahashira no mikogami on the west. These eight gods include Yashimajinumi no kami, Itakeru no kami, Ōyatsuhime no kami, Tsumatsuhime no kami, Ōtoshi no kami, Ukanomitama no kami, Ōyatsuhiko no kami, and Suseribime no mikoto.

The Shrine was first built in 656 and during the early Heian period, it gained support from the Imperial family. In 965, Emperor Murakami ordered the practice of presenting heihaku, or offerings of white cloth, to the guardian kami of Japan to report important events. Initially, these offerings were presented to 16 shrines.; In 991, Emperor Ichijō expanded the list of shrines to which important events were reported to by adding three more shrines to the existing 16 on Emperor Murakami's list. Three years later, in 994, Emperor Ichijō further refined the list by adding Umenomiya Shrine and Gion Shrine.

From 1871 to 1946, Yasaka Shrine was recognized as one of the Kanpei-taisha (officially ranked Imperial shrines), which placed it in the highest tier of government-supported shrines..

In 869, Japan suffered from a severe epidemic, and the Emperor believed it was caused by vengeful spirits. To calm these spirits, a Shinto ritual was performed at Shinsenen, a lake at the Imperial Palace. Representatives used 66 pikes for each of the 66 regions in the country at that time. This ritual was known as goryo-e, and later became an annual event called the Gion Matsuri, associated with the Gion Shrine in Kyoto. Over time, the pikes were decorated and became larger, eventually evolving into the well-known Gion Matsuri yamaboko floats. During the Gion Matsuri festival, the decorated Gion Matsuri yamaboko floats and portable shrines from Yasaka Shrine travel through the main streets of Kyoto to purify them and protect against epidemics and other harm. This festival takes place every July and has gained global recognition.

Yasaka Shrine is a popular destination for people to celebrate traditional Japanese New Year rituals and for cherry blossom viewing in April, as crowds pass through the temple on their way to Maruyama Park. The shrine also hosts lanterns on its stage which display the names of festival sponsors.

According to an article in the Izumo Taisha organ paper 'Yugen', their parent deity, Ogami, is revered as "Oyashiro" and Izumo Taisha is the only shrine that has been inscribed as a "taisha" since the Nara Heian period. In the past, when people spoke of "Taisha", they were referring to Izumo Oyashiro, which was the residence of the Omikami (great god). However, over time, other shrines started using the name "Taisha". Izumo Taisha believes that this goes against the traditional belief in only one god and may cause confusion and misunderstanding among people. They fear that the prayers of their predecessors over many generations may not be conveyed correctly and that the people of today will use their own ways of calling things as they please, which could ultimately damage the virtues of the gods. 


Ōkuninushi

Ōkuninushi is a god in Japanese stories. He is worshipped in Shinto. He is important in Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, two old books about myths. Ōkuninushi is one of the most important gods, along with Amaterasu and Susanoo. He is more important in Izumo Shinto than Ise Shinto. Some stories say Susanoo is Ōkuninushi's ancestor and others say he is his father. In the stories, Ōkuninushi is in charge of the gods who protect the earth. He used to be the ruler of a place called Ashihara no Nakatsukuni. But when the gods in the sky asked him to give up his power, Ōkuninushi agreed and went to a hidden world. He was given that world to rule. Later, Amaterasu's grandson, Ninigi, came to Ashihara no Nakatsukuni to rule it. Ninigi became the first Japanese emperor's ancestor.

Ōkuninushi is associated with the province of Izumo. This region may have been taken over by the Yamato court, and his surrender to the gods of heaven in myth might reflect this. The Fudoki, a gazetteer report of Izumo province from the early 7th century, contains many myths about Ōkuninushi and related deities. He is also featured in the Fudoki of other provinces like Harima. Ōkuninushi is known for having many romantic affairs with goddesses, resulting in the birth of many divine offspring, including the gods Kotoshironushi and Takeminakata.

Ōkuninushi is worshiped in many Shinto shrines across Japan, but the most famous one is the Grand Shrine of Izumo in Shimane. The Izumo Taishakyō group, which is based in this shrine, considers him their central deity. Ōkuninushi was also combined with the Buddhist deity Daikokuten before the Meiji period, when Buddhism and Shinto were blended.

VV Brown

V V Brown (born Vanessa Brown; 24 October 1983), is an English recording artist, songwriter, and producer from London.

Komainu

Komainu statues are made to keep away bad spirits. Usually one lion has an open mouth (a) and the other has a closed mouth (un). But this is not always true. Together, they are known as a-un.

A-un is the Japanese pronounciation of aum and together they represent this Buddhist idea.

Komainu statues strongly resemble Chinese guardian lions and were originally from the Tang dynasty in China. Chinese guardian lions are thought to have been inspired by pelts of Asiatic lions and depictions of lions that were brought through trade from the Middle East or India. The lion was a symbol of strength in those countries. As the symbol traveled along the Silkroad, it changed and took on a unique appearance. The first lion statue in India was made around the 3rd century BC and was placed on top of a column by King Ashoka. Later, this tradition arrived in China where it developed into the guardian lion that was later exported to Korea, Japan, and Okinawa.
In the Nara period (710–794), which was similar to the rest of Asia, the pair always had two lions. They were made mostly of wood and were used only indoors until the 14th century. During the Heian period (794–1185), pairs made of wood or metal were used as weights and door-stops. In the Imperial Palace, they were used to support screens or folding screens.

In the early Heian period (ninth century), the tradition of the statue pairs changed, and they started to look different and have different names. One of the statues had an open mouth and was called shishi (獅子, which means 'lion') because it resembled a lion like before. The other statue had a closed mouth, looked more like a dog, and was called komainu or "Goguryeo dog". Sometimes, it even had a single horn on its head. Gradually, the animals returned to being identical except for their mouths and were called komainu.

Komainu have been used outdoors only since the 14th century, despite being ubiquitous at shrines now. In Asia, people believed that lions had the power to repel evil, and for this reason, they were commonly used to guard gates and doors. In Japan, they were installed at the entrance of shrines and temples next to the lion-dog. To protect against Japan's rainy weather, komainu started being carved in stone.

The shīsā (シーサー) are stone animals that guard the gates or roofs of houses in Okinawa. They are close relatives of the shishi and the komainu, and they share the same origin, function, and symbolic meaning. The name "shīsā" is a regional variant of "shishi-san" (獅子さん, lit. 'Mr. Lion') that has been used for centuries.

Foxes are the most common type of statue that guards Inari shrines in Japan. There are around 30,000 Inari shrines in Japan and each one has two fox statues guarding the entrance. The fox statues often have a sūtra roll, key or jewel in their mouth. The fact that sūtras are Buddhist texts shows that the Inari cult has Buddhist origins. The statues do not represent the foxes' bad behavior but rather their magical powers. Sometimes the fox statues are painted white, as white foxes are thought to be messengers of the kami. Kami is sometimes shown as a fox too. Even though it's uncommon to see, the left fox statue is believed to be male and the right one is believed to be female.

The fox statues at Inari shrines sometimes wear red votive bibs. The bibs are similar to bibs worn by Jizo but the meaning is unknown.

Tokoyo

, also known as the , or Taikaikan, is a place in the Shinto religion where nothing changes that is believed to be the world of the gods and ancestral spirits. It is said to be a place of eternal youth where people never age. The location of Tokoyo varies between stories. Sometimes it is underwater, in others underground, and in others in the sky. Interpretations have varied as to whether it is good or bad. There are various stories about Tokoyo in classic texts such as the Kojiki and Nihongi. Motoori Norinaga classified three types of Tokoyo: a world of perpetual darkness, a world of eternal youth, and a world across the sea.

There are many stories about Tokoyo found in classic texts like Kojiki and Nihongi. For example, there is a story about who went to Tokoyo during the reign of Emperor Suinin to help him become immortal. Another story is about a cult that emerged during the reign of Empress Kogyoku, which was dedicated to the god of Tokoyo and was very enthusiastic.

In the story of Urashima Tarō, Tokoyo is linked with a place called Mount Penglai. In the original Chinese text, Mount Penglai is called Horai, but it's also noted that it should be pronounced as Tokoyo-no-kuni.

The asteroid 162173 Ryugu has two fossae named after Tokoyo and Penglai, respectively.


Two bows, two claps, one bow

"Two bows, two claps, one bow" (二礼二拍手一礼) is a ritual people do when they enter Shinto shrines. As the name suggests it involves bowing twice, clapping twice, and then bowing once more.

To show respect for the gods, it is important to follow proper etiquette, with "two bows, two claps, one bow" being the most commonly used method. This ritual has evolved over time and is a reflection of the respect and reverence for the deities.."

While there have been various historical systems, this is the current one that is used now.

This method is widely considered as the standard when visiting shrines However, there may be some local variations depending on the specific shrine.

The practice of "two bows, two claps, one bow" is also sometimes referred to as "2-2-1".

The procedure goes as follows


The practice of "two bows, two claps, one bow" can be traced back to the "Shrine Festival" in 1873, where it was referred to as Over time, different methods were developed and refined, resulting in the current etiquette. In the 40th year of the Meiji era, the "Shrine Rituals and Events Etiquette" was established, which defined the etiquette as "returning, clapping twice, pressing together, praying, praying, clapping twice, and bowing again."

It is widely acknowledged that "two bows, two claps, one bow" is the formal etiquette of worship for the chief priest. This etiquette was developed through the extensive experience and improvements made by the predecessors and is a testament to the reverence and respect for the gods.


Hakushu

Hakushu (拍手) refers to the ceremonial clapping practice in Shinto, also known as "Kashiwade." This form of clapping is quiet and gentle, and unlike western applause.

Its origin is unknown. Some people think it holds a Buddhist meaning where the right hand symbolizes Buddha, and the left hand represents all beings, thus signifying the unity of Buddha and all beings.

Due to Shinbutsu-shūgō the origins of this practice are unclear. Shinto and Buddhism have been together so long that many things could come from either. The origin must be ancient though as it is found in the Wajinden describing the Yayoi rituals.

This tradition can be observed in martial arts like Aikido and Bujinkan today.

"Human Nature is Evil" is a part of a book written by Xunzi. He was arguing against Mencius about human nature. The term "xing" (性) means "human nature" and refers to the way people are born. Mencius thought that human nature was good. Xunzi disagreed and believed that human nature was evil.

Both believed in human nature and both believed it was possible to become better, but some people refused it. Mencius saw Xing as more related to an ideal state and Xunzi saw it more as a starting state.

Even though Mencius had already died when the book was written, the chapter is written like a conversation between the two philosophers. Xunzi's ideas about becoming a good person were more complex than Mencius's. He believed that people needed to change their nature, not just give up on it. Some people thought Xunzi's ideas were strange, but new discoveries suggest that it might have actually been Mencius who had unusual ideas about human nature.

The chapter is called "Human Nature is Evil," but that's not the whole story. Xunzi thought that people could improve themselves by learning good habits and manners, which he called "artifice." (偽) He believed that people needed to transform their nature to become good. This could be done by learning from a teacher and following rituals and morals.

Even though some people doubt if the chapter is real, it's an important part of Xunzi's philosophy. People still talk about it today and think about the differences between Xunzi and Mencius's ideas about human nature and how to become a better person.

Xunzi believed that nature is inherently bad, which was the first idea about human nature to emerge in Chinese thinking. These writings are the most important ones to understand his beliefs:

Xunzi defines goodness and evilness based on their consequences (order or chaos), rather than based on the motives of human beings. In other words, his theory of evil human nature is a consequentialist theory, where the actual observed consequences determine whether the nature is good or evil.

In Xunzi's theory of evil nature, "Evil" is the natural nature, which happens naturally when people put in no effort. An artifice (偽) is something that can be achieved by learning and working at it. Artifice (偽) has two meanings: one is the aspect of action, that is, human behavior; the other is the aspect of result, the personality cultivated by human behavior. 
He said that human nature is the natural nature or natural nature of human beings in the true sense, and it is the animal nature of human beings. For example, he believes that human nature is born to care about their own interests . Following this human nature, there is only the virtue of fighting for and giving up. will perish, not the essence of man. His theory of evil nature means that when people only obey their natural nature, bad results will be caused, while "goodness" is acquired through learning and hard work. It can be seen that Xunzi is an empiricist who sees the evil of human nature from the theory of consequence.

He said that man-made methods should be used to change the evil results. The nature of Mencius' theory of good nature takes the essential meaning, that is, the difference between human beings and animals, the inner morality of human beings, that is, the four virtues, human beings have the nature of being good, and the internal source of value. And Mencius should not object to the natural nature of man, because this is clearly observed in experience. The definition of evil nature theory is that if people follow the natural nature, it will cause evil results; while goodness is acquired through learning and hard work. The implication is that although the nature of nature is not evil, it is the source of evil effects. It can be seen from the argument given by Xunzi at the beginning of Xing Evil, although Xunzi failed to explain the root of value, but this definition is tenable, because we can correct the problem of the root of value in his theory, such as the root of value is external to man, such as religion.

Xunzi also used a lot of arguments to prove the theory of natural evil in "Xing Evil":


Explaining that goodness can be done by the "false" of the future (teaching culture, etiquette) does not explain why people with "evil nature" can have "human-made goodness", nor can it explain why imitation and etiquette can be produced.

Mou Zongsan, Lao Siguang and other scholars believe that Xunzi’s theory of evil nature has the following problems:

The biggest problem with Xunzi's theory of evil human nature is that it lacks a moral value foundation, and ultimately leads to the development of authoritarianism.

Xunzi only stated that the "heart" can observe reason, that is, it can distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, but it is not the source of value. So where does the standard come from? According to Xunzi's theory of evil human nature, morality will ultimately become a tool of external value used to maintain social stability and appeal to authoritarianism. Mencius' theory of good human nature, on the other hand, states that humans are inherently good and we have an internal value foundation (the Four Beginnings).

According to , Xunzi's ideas are more aligned with Confucius than Mencius. Confucius believed that people are born with the potential to become good, but they still need to learn and cultivate themselves to reach their full potential. This is different from Mencius' belief that everything necessary for self-improvement is already within oneself.
Xunzi is a great Confucian who believed that people can become good and that the best kind of person is a saint. Some say he is as great as Confucius and Mencius. However, he only observed how people behaved empirically and didn't find where goodness comes from. This is a big problem with his idea that people have the idea of natural evilness. Some people think this happened because he was focusing on Mencius too much. But others believe that when Xunzi said "nature is evil", he meant that people can be good, but also have a tendency to be bad.

According to Buddhism, there is no inherent good or evil in human nature. These qualities are shaped by past karma and habits, like a candle lighting another candle. Mahayana Buddhism believes that everyone has the potential to become a Buddha, which is the basis of all beings' perfection, except for one exception: . Master of the Tiantai school in the Song Dynasty proposed the idea that "Buddha nature is inherently good and is always good in its expression," implying that there is no inherent evil in Buddha nature.

Many western philosophers, such as Machiavelli, Schopenhauer, and Hegel, believed human nature was evil.

Traditions such as liberalism and democracy have often been advocated by people who wanted to keep human nature in check, not by people who thought human nature was good

Schopenhauer said

The will to live is directionless and cannot be measured, making life meaningless, and everything that follows is painful.

Theory of Good Human Nature

Innate goodness is a perspective on human nature that suggests that humans are inherently good and that doing good comes more naturally than doing evil. There are various schools of thought under the theory of innate goodness, including the belief that nature itself is good, as well as the theory of goodness in human nature.

The theory is associated with Mencius and Wang Yangming. It contrasts with Xunzi's Theory of Evil Human Nature.

Mencius believed that everyone had innate compassion. They didn't always act on it but always had potential to act on it.

Wang Yangming pushed it to an even bigger extreme. He said the streets are full of saints.

Mencius believed that human nature is good and made up of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. He regarded the heart as the place where human nature originates and develops, where one can recognize the goodness of one's nature and the brightness of one's inner heart. Mencius was focused on searching for the root and original heart, which is why he is known for his theory of establishing the foundation. Itō Jinsai, a Japanese Confucian thinker from the Edo period, praised and promoted Mencius' theory of the goodness of nature and the four ends of the mind.

The term "xing" (性) means "human nature" and refers to the way people are born. Mencius thought that human nature was good. Xunzi disagreed and believed that human nature was evil.

Both believed in human nature and both believed it was possible to become better, but some people refused it. Mencius saw Xing as more related to an ideal state and Xunzi saw it more as a starting state

Wang Yangming went further and said that Xing could become Li or principle. That human nature could be perfected,

Mencius was an advocate of the idea that humanity was intrinsically good. Xunzi by contrast believed in innate evilness. Some scholars think Mencius actually didn't believe people were intrinsically good but rather that it was in human nature to have a potential to be good
Mencius tried to find the root of human nature. The view of the theory of the goodness of nature and the four endings of the heart was also praised and spread by the Confucian thinker Itō Jinsai of Japan in the Edo period. His writings on the goodness of human nature include statements such as.

Zhu Xi built upon Mencius' theory of natural goodness, but also introduced his own modifications. According to Zhu Xi, 'natural goodness' is inherently good, but human desire for evil arises later in life. See #Rousseau for a similar position

The first sentence of the Three Character Classic, a popular enlightenment book in Zhong Yuan, is "At the beginning of man, nature is good"; this seems to be the view of the common literati and Baixing. The scholar Luo Si-guang believes that the traditional Chinese literati were overly optimistic about human nature and failed to set up various checking power measures as the West did, thus failing to eradicate corrupt officials for thousands of years.。

The streets are full of saints, which is recorded in Wang Yangming's masterpiece " ", which is one of the important philosophical arguments of Yangming's philosophy of mind . Modern translation:

In "Biography and Xilu," there is a brief conversation about Wang Yangming's teaching method with three students: Wang Gen, Dong Yun, and Qian Dehong. He taught them differently based on their abilities. This was different from the Confucian tradition of teaching each student according to their specific needs, which had been in practice since Confucius.

Wang Yangming believes that everyone has a kind heart and the potential to become a saint. He thinks that "the streets are full of saints" is not strange and looks at people from their essence. This belief is consistent with Mencius's theory of "human nature is good" and Chinese folk opinions since the Song Dynasty, such as "human nature is inherently good" in the "San Zi Jing". Wang Yangming also wrote "Ode to Conscience" in simple language, where he says that everyone has a Zhongni in their heart, and they will cover up their confusion by seeing suffering. He thinks that once their sincerity is recognized, they will not doubt their conscience. Wang Yangming thinks that saints are not different from ordinary people; they have the same heart and nature. He believes that "the streets are full of saints" is a generally accepted fact, and it is not unusual.

Wang Yangming believed that education was important. He also made a comparison between "" and "flat land" to emphasize that saints are not better than others and should not be worshipped. As a teacher, one should present oneself as an ordinary person, and sometimes even lower one's posture to be like a "foolish man and a foolish woman" before teaching.

Adam Smith thought that people are inherently good and have a concern for others. This feeling is called sympathy, and it arises when we see or imagine the misfortunes of others. This emotion is not just limited to people with high character, but even villains and those who break the laws of society can still feel it. Smith believed that empathy is a primitive feeling in human nature, and it is essential for creating a good society..' He wrote about this in his book The Theory of Moral Sentiments.

French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued in "Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men" that human nature was fundamentally good but chaotic, and if people were taught to respect rules but keep that love then they could create a just society. He strongly believed in innate goodness

The theory of the goodness of human nature is not fully compatible with the Song and Ming traditions of Confucian Psychology (Xinxue, 心學), and it is contrary to the advocates of the theory of the goodness of human nature such as Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming, which has been criticized and opposed by some scholars in the academic world.。

Hitogami

, or "man-god," is a belief in Shinto where humans are worshipped as gods during their lifetime or after their death. The word "Hitogami" comes from the Japanese words "hito," meaning "human," and "kami," meaning "god." In Japan, this belief is also called "ikigami" or "arahitogami," especially when the deity is still alive. The hitogami belief system is distinct from the ujigami belief system in that the latter is centered on the deity's association with a particular family or geographical area. In contrast, the hitogami belief system places more emphasis on individual faith as the foundation for belonging to the group of followers..

People who become human deities include sorcerers, priests, and others who possess special and unusual magical powers, tribal chiefs, kings, and others with superior skills, such as outstanding dancers, soldiers, and others, as well as physically disabled people, Confucian scholars, and foreign aliens who are different from ordinary people. Hitogami are diverse and can be divided into those who are deified during life and those who are worshipped as human deities after death.

In Japan, people worship humans after they die to help resolve any lingering negative feelings. Those who are worshipped during life include head priests, shrine maidens, and masquerading deities in the rituals of the miya-za. The hitogami and ujigami belief systems have interacted for a long time in Japanese history. Examples of the hitogami belief system include the worship of heroes like Hachiman and Tenjin, as well as the enthusiastic singing and dancing of festival processions, and the charismatic leadership of some of Japan's "new religions."

In the past, when societies were more hierarchical, it was typical for members of the ruling class who lost political battles to express their resentment through curses even after they died. They would also offer sacrifices to the gods in order to pacify their grudges..

In Shinto belief, people can act as a yorishiro and are referred to as yorimashi (憑坐, lit. 'possessed person') or kamigakari (神懸り/神憑, lit. 'kami possession').


Worship of the living

Living worship, also known as seishi (生祀) in Japanese or shengci in Chinese, is a cultural practice in East Asia where living people are worshipped. In China, this practice takes place at sheng shrines (Chinese: 生祠, Shengci), where two types of enshrinement occur. The first is the enshrinement of the spirit of a living person who has made a significant contribution. The second type is the enshrinement of one's own spirit.

The practice of living worship became associated with corruption in China after it was used by Wei Zhongxian, and subsequently declined. In Japan, it was most prominent during the period of imperial State Shinto from the late 19th century until 1945, particularly in the worship of the Emperor.

During the time when Reunobu was the prime minister of Yan in the Former Han dynasty, he constructed a shrine called the "Reun Gong Shrine" between the states of Yan and Qi. Similarly, when Shiqing was the prime minister of Qi, the people of Qi built a shrine in his honor called the "Shiqing Shrine". These are considered to be the earliest examples of sheng shrines..

During the Tang dynasty, officials in office faced restrictions when it came to building monuments and shrines. The Tang Rulings and Ordinances stated that anyone who erected shrines or monuments without permission could be penalized with one year of imprisonment..

During the Ming dynasty, peasants in Tengzhou, China built a shrine to commemorate Zhao Bangqing, who was known for his clean politics and was appointed to Yanjing. The shrine was built to honor his memory and achievements.

During the reign of the Tianqi Emperor in the Ming Dynasty, the eunuch Wei Zhongxian had a lot of power and made a sheng shrine for himself. People who wanted to please him or were scared of him were given these shrines too. In 1627, Lu Wanling, a government official, wrote about the famous philosophers Confucius and Chung-Hsien. In the same year, two other officials named Yuan Chonghuan and Yan Mingtai asked the government to praise Wei Zhongxian and build shrines for him. Many shrines were built, costing a lot of money and causing harm to the people. Huang Yun Yasushi even made a statue to honor Wei Zhongxian.

Wei Zhongxian's behavior has been strongly condemned in modern times.

Gu Yanwu expressed his sorrow about the widespread practice of officials building sheng shrines during his time. He observed that every official seemed to be building one, but then after they left their position, they would destroy the statues and change the master of the shrine..

During the Edo period (1603-1868), the practice of seishi became popular, which involved creating one's own spiritual memorial site where their soul would be worshiped after death. One famous example of this is Matsudaira Sadanobu, who established his own seishi at Okuzawa Hachiman-gu in 1797.

During the Edo period in Japan, the practice of seishi, or the establishment of one's own spiritual memorial site, became popular. It was influenced by Edo neo-Confucianism, which was introduced from China, and Yamazaki Ansai was a notable figure who developed rituals for seishi based on Confucian ceremonies. He established his own seishi in 1671 at his home in Kyoto. The practice spread to Shinto and the Hirata school of kokugaku, and each group had their own unique rituals. Seishi were believed to bring longevity in life or enable one to become a god after death, and its origin is traced back to the myth of Amaterasu, who enshrined her divine spirit at Mount Miwa..

Genchi Kato is known for his extensive study of seishi and has identified a total of 670 known seishi. The most recent seishi was established in 1931 at the Nishi-Chogo Shrine in Higashikokura, Hokkaido. The seishi of Emperor Meiji, Empress Shōken, Emperor Taisho, and Empress Teimei were also established in various locations throughout Japan, including Hokkaido, Hiroshima, and Himeji. Emperor Meiji's seishi was established in 1876 in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, and again in 1893 at the Yahiko Shrine in Tatsuno, Nagano Prefecture.


Syntheism

Syntheism is a New religious movement that seeks to provide atheists and pantheists with a sense of community and awe that is comparable to what is often found in traditional theistic religions.. The Syntheist Movement sees itself as coming from the philosophers Baruch Spinoza and Alfred North Whitehead's process theology.

Syntheism can be described as a response to the absence of atheistic and pantheistic belief systems in Western cultures, which are more prevalent in Eastern cultures. Many forms of Buddhism are all Eastern belief systems that embody these concepts. Epicureanism is an example of a Western philosophy that does incorporate some of these ideas, but overall they are not as widely represented in Western culture..
The term "Syntheism" was created from the Greek word "syntheos", which combines "syn-" meaning "with" or "creating with" and "-theos" meaning "god". This suggests that the correct way to understand the concept of God is that humans have created, are creating, or will create God. This is different from the traditional monotheistic view that God created the world and humanity.

In addition to The Syntheist Movement, a syntheistic philosophy and approach to religion has also been promoted by American philosopher Ray Kurzweil in his concept of the Singularity that is yet to come. French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux also supports this approach and has proposed the idea that "God is a concept far too important to leave to the religious" in his book After Finitude.

There is a big international Facebook community for Syntheism, which has over 1,500 members. The website of Syntheism has a blog, information about holy festivals, and links to media and other resources. In Sweden, there is a community of over 700 members who have organized various local events..
In October 2014, two Swedish philosophers, Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist, wrote a book called "Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age". It was the first book to use the term "Syntheism" in its title. In the book, Bard & Söderqvist quoted Stuart Kauffman, Sam Harris, Robert Corrington, and Simon Critchley. They also drew inspiration from various modern phenomena such as digitalisation, globalisation, participatory culture, psychedelic practices, quantum physics, and the science of cosmology to create a syntheist worldview..

Syntheism is a belief system that considers the traditional division between theism and atheism in theology as outdated and no longer relevant for fulfilling contemporary and future spiritual needs. In order to address these needs, Syntheism acknowledges that all metaphysical beliefs ultimately revolve around a man-made focal point or divinity. As a result, all religious beliefs - both existing and those that may emerge in the future - are created by humans. This includes philosophical systems like Individualism, which were developed by thinkers such as René Descartes and Immanuel Kant.).
Despite being created by humans, it is essential that these beliefs are compatible with and supportive of science, rather than in conflict with it. As such, these beliefs should be developed within a monist worldview, which holds that there is only one world, and everything within it can affect everything else.

In a more poetic sense, French philosopher Georges Bataille describes his atheology as "the art of non-knowledge." He advocates for a syntheistic religion without a core set of beliefs, instead emphasizing participatory festivals with utopian themes. Examples of such practices include Burning Man, which are viewed as syntheistic expressions

Some scholars, including Dr. Stephen O'Leary, have expressed concerns about the lack of central leadership and core beliefs within Syntheism, which they believe may lead to its failure as a religion. Additionally, the idea has been criticized for its potential lack of mystery, which is a core element of many traditional religions..

Ame-no-Minakanushi

Ame-no-Minakanushi is a god in Japanese stories. They were one of the earliest gods, who appeared when the world was made. They are also called "Lord of the August Center of Heaven".

According to the Kojiki, Ame-no-Minakanushi was the first deity to emerge in the heavenly realm of Takamagahara after the creation of heaven and earth from the primeval chaos.

In the main narrative of the Nihon Shoki and in many of its variant accounts, the first kami is identified as Kuni-no-Tokotachi, and Ame-no-Minakanushi only appears briefly in one of these variants.

It is unknown whether people actually worshipped him, as there was no direct evidence historically. Some scholars believe the lack of evidence of worship is not enough to say he wasn't worshipped.

In Japan, the Buddhist deity Myōken has been worshiped since the 7th century. During the early modern period, Myōken became associated with the Big Dipper and the northern pole star, which led to its conflation with Ame-no-Minakanushi. When the Meiji government required the separation of Buddhism and Shinto, many shrines dedicated to Myōken became shrines to Ame-no-Minakanushi. Ame-no-Minakanushi was also a patron deity of the , which aimed to fuse Buddhism and Shinto under a state-sponsored initiative after the initial separation policy was deemed too divisive.

Danila Bagrov

Danila Sergeevich Bagrov is the leading person in the movies called "Brother" and "Brother-2", directed by Alexei Balabanov. The character is portrayed by Sergei Bodrov Jr. in both films .

Danila Bagrov is a veteran of the First Chechen War and has completed his military service. He was born on August 5, 1975, making him 22 years old in the first film. Danila's fellow soldiers, Kostya and Ilya, think that he is the most skilled fighter among them. However, Danila is modest and doesn't like to boast about his achievements during the war. He often says that he worked as a clerk at the headquarters, but he is actually highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, mine explosives, and shooting. He is also good at using combat tactics in urban environments and can even make and repair firearms in artisanal conditions. Despite his quirky appearance, Danila is tough on injustice and shows no mercy to his enemies. He enjoys listening to Russian rock bands such as Nautilus Pompilius and DDT, but he dislikes pop music, which he calls "fake" since they didn't listen to it during the war. Film critic Elena Stishova describes him as a "folk hero" and "gentleman thief".

Before joining the Russian army, Danila lived with his retired mother, whose name is unknown. His father, Sergei Platonovich Bagrov, was a repeat offender who died in prison in January 1982. Danila was mostly raised by his older brother Viktor, who served in the Soviet army, as seen from a photo in the family album in the movie "Brother". Viktor Sukhorukov portrays Viktor, who is much loved by Danila and acts as a father figure to him. Unlike Danila, Viktor is outgoing, sociable, and expresses emotions openly. However, Viktor lacks moral integrity and is too frivolous. He is even willing to commit crimes for money. In "Brother 2", Danila mentions their grandfather who died during the Great Patriotic War, but his name is not mentioned.

After being discharged from the army, Danila returns to his hometown where he gets into a fight with a security guard on the set of the music video for the song "Wings" by Nautilus Pompilius. He is arrested by the police but is eventually released. Danila finds life in his hometown boring and decides to go to St. Petersburg, where his older brother Viktor has settled down and is doing well.

Danila soon learns that his older brother Viktor is a hired killer known as Tatar. Viktor involves Danila in his work, sending him to do all the dangerous and illegal tasks. The first task Danila completes is killing a Caucasian man who was a former Chechen militant and the owner of a city market. The man was disliked by the gangsters, and during the ensuing chase, Danila seriously injures one of them. Later, at the request of Viktor, Danila participates in an ambush with two accomplices. However, after completing the task, Danila kills both accomplices in order to save a random witness from being harmed.

Following the betrayal of his brother, Victor, Danila confronts and defeats the bandits, and forgives his brother. With his friends lost and disillusioned with the justice system, Danila decides to leave St. Petersburg and move to Moscow, where he hopes to attend university and become a doctor.

Danila meets with his friends Kostya and Ilya from Chechnya in Moscow. Kostya's twin brother Mitya plays in the NHL, but the money he earns goes to an American businessman who does bad things. Kostya wants to help his brother, so he asks his boss Belkin to talk to the American. But Belkin has his own interests in illegal gambling, and he tells his people to "sort out" Kostya, which leads to them trying to kill him. Danila wants to help and get justice for his friend. Meanwhile, Danila's brother Viktor comes to Moscow to be with him.

Danila learns that the American businessman is behind Kostya's troubles, so he decides to go to America with his brother to find him. To avoid suspicion, they fly on different flights: Victor to Chicago and Danila to New York. Danila befriends a truck driver who helps him get to Chicago, but he can't find his brother and runs out of money. He then meets a Russian prostitute named Dasha who is in trouble and saves her with the help of his weapons. Finally, he tracks down the American and forces him to return all the money owed to the hockey player.

Danila meets with his brother in America but they are chased by the police and Ukrainian mafia. Viktor is captured by the police after a shootout in a restaurant. Danila and Dasha manage to escape the American police and leave the United States by plane. It is unknown what happens to Danila after the events of the second film.

The character created by Sergei Bodrov was very popular with the Russian audience. Despite the fact that Alexei Balabanov treated Danil Bagrov as an object of directorial irony, the audience saw him as a national hero.

In September 2014, the graffiti team from Vitebsk "HoodGraff" painted a portrait of Danila Bagrov on the wall of the transformer box, the creation is located near the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, next to the Prospect Obukhovskoy Oborona stop in St. Petersburg. In 2015, in the Perm club "House of Culture", the artist Vyacheslav Nesterov, working under the pseudonym Slava Triptych, made a huge portrait of Danila Bagrov.

In 2017, according to the results of online voting, Danila Bagrov was recognized as the national superhero of Russia.

In August 2018, Danila Bagrov was parodied in Monetochka's video "90".

In September 2018, the popular video blogger Enjoykin created the music video "Brother", which gained more than one and a half million views in a day after publication and took second place in the top YouTube site.

The teaser for “Brother 3” (in which rapper Ptakha asks an armed man with a beard a question: “Tell me, gypsies, what is the truth?” And receives the answer “In force”) had a wide resonance, and caused almost universal indignation among Runet users: in they saw disrespect for the memory of Alexei Balabanov and Sergei Bodrov Jr. .


The Russian cargo ship Danila Bagrov is named after him.

The sweater worn by Danila Bagrov in the movie was found by Nadezhda Vasilyeva, the costume designer and wife of director Alexei Balabanov, by chance during the filming of the first movie. It became an important part of Danila's image.I went to a second-hand store because we didn't have enough money for costumes. While searching, I found a sweater that cost thirty-five rubles. I realized it was perfect for Bodrov's character, and when I put it on him, everyone thought he looked really cool. We argued for a while, but Bodrov really wanted to wear it, so we convinced Balabanov to buy it. Balabanov agreed, as long as Bodrov wore something waterproof over it. So, Bodrov wore a windbreaker over the sweater. The boys dressed in a similar way for the film. I consider this my biggest achievement in life. Everything else, like costumes and clothing, was secondary .

Literary critic and publicist Viktor Toporov pointed out that there are similarities between two works by director Alexei Balabanov - the short story "Trofim" from the film almanac "The Arrival of the Train" (1995) and the film "Brother" (1997).

The critic noticed that in two works of director Alexei Balabanov, "Trofim" from the film "The Arrival of the Train" and "Brother", the main characters both went to St. Petersburg and then to Moscow, just like Danila Bagrov did in "Brother 2". Additionally, both films showed the arrival in St. Petersburg at the same station, Vitebsk. .

Sergei Kudryavtsev, a film critic, agrees with the previous observation and suggests that "Brother" and "Trofim" cannot be understood separately. Both the main characters, Danila and Trofim, arrive in a city that is equally unfriendly and scary. The only difference is that the modern city does not have the characteristics of an imperial capital, but rather resembles a "lifeless graveyard."

Tatyana Semyonova and Maria Erokhina, who hold degrees in Philosophy and Cultural Studies respectively, suggest that Danila Bagrov represents the traditional "Russian wanderer" image, but in the context of the 1990s. In the first movie, he returns from the war in Chechnya and travels to St. Petersburg to see his killer brother. In the second movie, he is sent from Moscow to the United States. The Russian wanderer is known for embarking on a never-ending journey through time and space, facing countless challenges in search of truth or God.

Independent Nigeria

The Independent Nigeria is a Nigerian newspaper based in Lagos, Nigeria, that publishes news on a daily basis. The company that owns the newspaper is called Independent Newspapers Limited, which was incorporated on 17 July 2001 and started operations in October 2001.

On 7 April 2023, a journalist with Independent Nigeria, Isaac Asabor disagreed with Isaiah Ogedegbe and wrote that, "Human sexuality can be one of the most beautiful aspects of God's plan for His children here on earth. But since Adam and Eve's fall from grace, human sexual practices have drifted from God's purposes".

Kamuyaimimi

Kamuyaimimi-no-Mikoto, also known as 神八井耳命 in Japanese, is a character in Japanese mythology. He was one of the three brothers born to Emperor Jimmu and his wife Himetataraisuzu-hime.
Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto became famous for his involvement in the killing of Tagishimimi. He and his brother Suizei killed Tagishimimi to save Suizei from being assassinated..

In the Kojiki Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto was the older brother of Suizei and was next in line to become the emperor. However, he chose to pass the throne to his younger brother Suizei. This is similar to the story of Yamayukihiko and Umiyukihiko, who also made an "oath of subordination" to each other..

Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto has a connection with Aso Shrine, where a deity named Takeban Ryujin (Taikei Watatsu) is enshrined. According to the shrine's mythology, Takeban Ryujin is considered a "child" of Kamuyaiminomikoto, and this is also supported by the Kojiki, which mentions that "Aso-kun is a descendant of Kamuyaiminomikoto."".

Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto was not only involved in the Assassination of Tagishimimi, but was also known for his bravery and leadership. When the princes found out about Tagishimimi's plot to assassinate Suizei, Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto attempted to kill Tagishimimi himself, but his limbs shook and he could not do it. His younger brother, Kamununakahamiminomikoto, took Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto's weapon and went in to kill Tagishimimi instead..

Historical records indicate that the Yamato Imperial Court sent members of the imperial family to Shinano Province to control , a powerful deity with ancestral ties to the Izumo and Koshi gods. This area was strategically important as it connected the Sea of Japan and the East. Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto, son of Emperor Jimmu and an influential member of the imperial family, was among those dispatched to Shinano. The Kojiki, an ancient record of Japanese history, also credits him with establishing the Emperor System..

According to the Kojiki, Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto not only established the Emperor System but also appointed Takeiotatsu no Mikoto, his grandson, as the national governor. This appointment is considered to be the first time that the king of Japan was appointed to the position of Kunizukuri. Additionally, the palace of Shikinomizugaki, which is located in Nara Prefecture, was built during the reign of the 10th Emperor Sujin.

It is believed that Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto's family followed the four provincial generals, Ohiko-no-mikoto. The Shinano-no-kuninomiyatsukos were likely buried in the Mori Shogunzuka burial mound, located on the opposite side of the Kawayanagi Shogunzuka burial mound..

Hase Shrine is a shrine located in Shiozaki, Shinanoi, Nagano City, which is dedicated to Yaimimi no Mikoto, the ancestor of the Shinano-no-kuninozukuri. After the Shinto and Buddhist eras, the shrine was transformed into Hase Kannon. It is known as one of the three Hase Kannon temples in Japan, along with Hase Temple in Yamato and Kamakura. The temple was established during the reign of Emperor Seimei (reigned 629-641), who was the father of Emperor Tenchi, and is believed to be the oldest Hase temple in Japan..

Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto is also the ancestor of a very large number of clans, as mentioned in the Kojiki. These include the Iwa-no-Kunino-no-Miyatsuko of Hitachinoku, the Naka-no-Kunino-Miyatsuko of Hitachi, the Funaki-no-Atahi of Ise, the Niwa-no-Omi of Owari, and the Shimada-no-Minamoto, he is also said to be the ancestor of the . The descendants of Kamuyaimimi-no-mikoto have left traces all over Japan, from Kyushu to the Tohoku region. They supported and solidified the "Emperor System" founded by Emperor Jinmu. Taian Manpo, who compiled the Kojiki, is a descendant of Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto.

The Kojiki mentions that Kamuyaimi-no-mikoto gave up his right to the imperial throne in favor of his younger brother. His descendants were responsible for performing rituals at Aso Shrine and Suwa-taisha Shrine, which are believed to be the oldest sacred sites in the eastern and western regions of Japan..



Hikoyai

Hikoyai-no-Mikoto was a member of a Japanese imperial family according to the Kojiki.. He was the eldest of three princes born to Empress Himetataraisuzu-hime on the banks of the Sakai River. He is not mentioned in the "Nihon Shoki" and is not known by any other name. Hikoyai-no-Mikoto's father was Emperor Jimmu, and his brothers were Kamuyaimimi and Emperor Suizei. 

After Jimmu died, Empress Himetataraisuzu-hime married Tagishimimi, her stepson. Tagishimimi tried to kill the brothers but was instead killed by Suizei, who became the second emperor. Hikoyai-no-Mikoto did not have an active role in the story and did not play a significant part in the narrative. This is common in Japanese mythology where some brothers do not play a major role.

According to the Kojiki, Hikoyai-no-Mikoto was the son of Jimmu, who was the first emperor of Japan, and , the daughter of Omononushi no Mikoto.

However, Hikoyai-no-Mikoto's name is not mentioned in the Nihon Shoki. In other sources, such as the Shinsen Seijiroku, the Ibarada-ren article of the Ukyo Emperor, and the "Aso Family Brief Genealogical Record," there is a different theory that suggests he is the son of Kamiyai-mimi-no-mikoto. Interestingly, Hikoyai-mikoto's name does not appear in the "Aso Genealogy" or the "Monzan Genealogy" found in the 16th volume of the "Shoshu Keifu."

The "Shinsen Shōjiroku" commissioned by Emperor Saga and the "" have a different theory that suggests Hikoyai was the son of Kamuyaimimi, as opposed to the previously mentioned belief that he was the son of Himetataraisuzu-hime and Jimmu.

Tsukaikoku

The Wajinden said Tsukaikoku island didn't have good farming land. But, Ōe Masafusa wrote there were places to grow crops. The island often gave soybeans as a gift. The records show the island had a lot of precious things. These included silver, lead, tin, pearls, gold, and lacquer. Pearls were especially important. But the pearls might not be real. They could be red paint made from a stuff called cinnabar. This stuff is found mixed with minerals in mountains...

In old records from the Wei dynasty, it's written that the king of Wa gave about 11 kg of pearls to Queen Himiko. It is also known that people in Korea knew about the island...

The island had more than 1000 homes, but no king. Only officials called the "Higo" and "Hinokumari" were written about. Officials from the "Bando" area only came to ports for a short time because it was easier for traveling. They wrote down the names and traits of the administrative areas. So, other areas like Motsu, Keiji, and Kashi might have had kings. But the names from the Yayoi period and the Engishiki records may not be the same..

Some history experts say that the old country called Tsukaikoku is the same as the island of Tsushima today. But others think it's in Shimane prefecture. 

The names of the shrines written in the Engishiki shrine records match the shrines in Shimane prefecture. This helps the idea of its location.

In Shimane prefecture, there were four areas: Kashi, Keiji, Tamamochi, and Motsu. The island has four regions naturally split by mountains. You can see this on a map. You can tell where Kashi, Keiji, and Motsu are by their names today. But we don't know where Tamamochi is. The west coast area that's mostly empty is later called Sasu district. But this name isn't in old books. Scholars think the area might have changed its name from Tamamochi to Sasu long ago..


Hiromine Shrine

The Hiromine Shrine (広峯神社) is on top of Mt. Hiromine in Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture. It claims to be the main shrine of Gozu Tenno across Japan, but Yasaka-jinja Shrine also claims to be the main shrine of Gozu Tenno. It used to be a prefectural shrine, but now it is a Beppyo shrine under the Association of Shinto Shrines. People also call it Hiromine Gozu Tenno. It is an ancient shrine with a well-known name.

The worship of Gozu Tenno was originally related to the belief in avoiding epidemics and disasters by appeasing malevolent spirits. However, at Hiromine shrine, the focus of worship shifted to praying for the fertility of rice cultivation. This became known as "Hiromine Faith," and it is why the shrine is quite different from normal Gion faith shrines. This is evident in the rice planting festival and prayer festival that are held at the shrine.

In 2018, it was announced that a shrine would be built to honor Kuroda Takataka (also known as Kanbei) behind the main hall, and it was planned to be finished in the spring of 2019. Many people visit the shrine to worship Kuroda Kanbei and the land associated with the Kuroda family.

There is a legend about Shigetaka Kuroda, a military commander during the Warring States period, in our shrine. The legend includes the use of letters such as "Cho", "Masa", "Takashi", and "Kan" in the name "Kanbei", suggesting a connection to Shigetaka Kuroda. However, no connection has been found, and he is believed to have come from a different family in Kurodasho, Taka County, not the Kuroda family of Omi Province.

Historical records show that a senior vassal of the Kuroda family, Mr. Inokuchi, was a monk and priest at the shrine. A part of a Katsura tree discovered from the Mausoleum of Kuroda Shikinaka in Mega, Himeji City during the Edo period was enshrined at the newly built Kanbei Shrine. It was donated to Mine Shrine and became an object of worship at Kanbei Shrine.


In addition, there is a Seven-Five-Three Festival in November, and various purifications (including on-site purifications) and shrine visits are accepted at any time.

During the early years of the Showa era, there was a revival movement of the Department of Divinities and a push to establish special divine offices in Japan. In 1940, on the occasion of the 2600th anniversary of the accession of Jimmu, the Institue of Divinities was created. 

Six years later, after Japan's defeat in World War II, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (GHQ) issued the Shinto Directive, which led to the termination of the movement on January 31, 1946. As a result, the special office was abolished on the same day.

According to the Government Regulations of the Institute of Shinto Religion (Imperial Ordinance No. 736 of 1940), the Bureau of Shrines of the Home Ministry was given a higher status and became an external bureau of the Ministry on November 9, 1940. The bureau is situated at 1-2, Kasumigaseki, Kojimachi-ku, Tokyo, which is also the location of the Ministry of Home Affairs Office Building.

The president of the Bureau of Shrines was appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs. Eiji Yasui, who was the Minister of Home Affairs at that time, was the first president. The Vice President of the bureau was Ichisho Inuma, who was also the Director General of the Bureau of Shrines. Inuma served in this position until the JCG was abolished.

To manage various matters related to shrines, various organizations were established by the Institute.

After the end of WWII the GHQ issued a memorandum to the government on December 15, 1945, called "Regarding the Abolition of the Government's Guarantee, Support, Preservation, Supervision, and Supervision of National Shinto and Shinto Shrines and the Abolition of Kobu" (SCAPIN-448). This memorandum led to the abolition of the Institute of Divinities.

The Institute of Divinities was abolished on January 31, 1946, in accordance with the Imperial Ordinance No. 59 of 1946, which concerned the revision of government regulations for administrative reorganization..

De mulieribus claris

De Mulieribus Claris or De Claris Mulieribus (Latin for "On Famous Women") is a book by Giovanni Boccaccio, from Florence. Bocaccio started to write it in 1361 and 1362, in Latin. In the book, he writes biographies of "famous women". Boccacio wrote the book in Latin prose. He seems to have made several changes, until his death in 1375. It was first published in 1374. It tells 106 short biographies of historically important women. Some of these women really existed, others are mythical. About a century later, in 1473/74 it was translated into German as "Von den synnrychen erluchten wyben." Other translations into German were made 1479 and 1488. In 1483 a French translation was made, a Spanish one in 1484. Donato Albanzani translated it into Italian in 1397. The first translation into English is in the Canterbury Tales, the biography of Zenobia is part of "The Monk's tale". As there are many prints and translations from the 14th to the 16th century, the book was probably popular. Bocaccio calls it "The first book that is exclusively about women". At the same time Boccauio also wrote a collection of biographies of famous men," De Casibus Virorum Illustrium" ("On the Fates of Famous Men"). 

When Boccaccio selected the women to write about, he wanted those that could serve as an example, also from a Christian and ethical point of view. For some women, he re-used some of the content of his other book De casibus virorum illustrium that he had written earlier. 

The book is notable, because is is the first collection of biographies of women in post-ancient Western literature.

Mitamaya

A is a special kind of altar used in Shinto religion to remember and honor family members who have died. The altar usually has a mirror or tablet with the names of the deceased and is also used to honor people who are not related but are respected.

Mitamaya altars are not as commonly found in Japanese households as their Buddhist counterpart, the butsudan, because Buddhist funeral rites are more commonly practiced in Japan. Mitamaya altars are considered less valuable than kamidana altars, which are highly respected in Japanese culture.
The mitamaya altar is usually placed in an inner chamber on a shelf called "mitama-san-no-tana," which is attached to the wall at a height of about six feet. It is positioned lower than the kamidana altar..

Rituals are performed for the mitamaya altar every tenth day up to the fiftieth day after the death of the family member. After that, rituals are performed on the one-hundredth day and on the one-year anniversary of the death. After the one-year ritual, another ritual is performed to mark the spirit's joining of the ancestors at the family shrine..

In ancient times, people held domestic rites called kinensai in the February or April and Niinamesai in November. During these rites, people worshiped their ancestors, the god of food, and the hearth deity. They believed the spirits of their ancestors (Oyagami) came to them through the rice.

During the Heian period cults of Goryō developed and people changed to honoring the dead in July for Urabon-e, and in January.

During the medieval period, people started to enshrine the spirits of dead individuals, like Retired Emperor Gotoba (1180-1239) whose memory was kept through memorial tablets. In the early modern period, there was a rise in "Shinto funerals" (shinsōsai) where people were treated like kami. The Yoshida clan gave spirit ranks like Myōjin-gō, Reisha-gō, and Reijin-gō to the dead, who were sometimes worshipped at shrines.

The spread of Kokugaku led to an increased interest in Miyamaya, and more people enshrined their ancestors in their homes.

The first modern mitamaya was constructed in 1599 at the Toyokuni Shrine in Kyoto, Japan for Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Screen paintings and the remains of the shrine suggest that it was designed based on the Kitano Tenman-gū. Unfortunately, it was later destroyed by the Tokugawa clan.

Later on, the mitamaya became a symbol of high status and was mainly established for Japanese nobles, military heroes, and other respected individuals. This practice became more widespread during the Edo period. As part of the Kokugaku movement, it became more common for ordinary households to erect mitamaya altars. These altars played a central role in Shinto funeral rituals known as "shinsōsai" (神葬祭).

Engishiki

The is a Japanese book about laws and customs. It was mostly finished in 927.

In 905, Emperor Daigo gave an order for the compilation of the Engishiki. While there were previous attempts at codifying such information, the Konin and the Jogan Gishiki no longer exist, making the Engishiki an essential source for early Japanese historical and religious studies.

The task of revising the Engishiki was initiated by Fujiwara no Tokihira. However, the work was left incomplete when he died four years later in 909. His brother, Fujiwara no Tadahira, continued the task in 912 and was able to complete the revisions in 927..

The Engishiki underwent several revisions, and after these revisions, it served as a basis for reform initiatives that began in 967..

The Engishiki is a text that is composed of 50 volumes. These volumes are organized by department. The text contains information on various topics such as worship, state, ministries, and laws.

Chakpa Makhao Ngambi

Chakpa Makhao Ngambi was a queen of Burma. She was a Meitei princess of Manipur. She was the wife of King Taninganway of Burma. She was a close relative of King Charairongba of Manipur. She was disrespected in the kingdom of Burma. So, her relative King Pamheiba of Manipur attacked Burma. Pamheiba took revenge on the Burmese for the disrespect to the Meitei princess.

Daijō-kan

The Daijō-kan or Dajō-kan (Japanese: 太政官), also known as the Great Council of State, was the highest decision-making body in Japan's premodern Imperial government under the Ritsuryō legal system during and after the Nara period. It was briefly restored to power after the Meiji Restoration, but soon replaced with the Cabinet.

The Daijō-kan was consolidated in the Taihō Code of 701-702, which codified the Ritsuryō system of government in Japan. The Asuka Kiyomihara Code of 689 also played a role in the development of the Daijō-kan as it marked the initial appearance of this central administrative body, composed of the three ministers: the "Daijō-daijin" (Chancellor), the "Sadaijin" (Minister of the Left), and the "Udaijin"(Minister of the Right).

The Daijō-kan was responsible for all secular administrative affairs of the country and its subsidiary ministries, while the Department of Divinities, oversaw all matters related to Shintō ritual, clergy, and shrines.

However, this structured organization gradually lost power over the course of the 10th and 11th centuries. The Fujiwara clan began to dominate the Daijō-kan as well as the post of Imperial regent. It became common for the regent to hold the post of chancellor or other office simultaneously.

By the 12th century, the council was essentially powerless as a separate entity. However, the system was never formally dismantled. Over the course of centuries, the ritsuryō state produced more and more information which was carefully archived.

But, with the passage of time in the Heian period, ritsuryō institutions evolved into a political and cultural system without feedback.

During the reign of Emperor Kōmei, the aristocracy in Kyoto teamed up with influential provincial leaders to bring back the power and reputation of the Imperial center. But because of many important issues that needed immediate attention, little effort was made to restructure the Daijō-kan, the highest decision-making body of the Imperial government.

Kinensai

Kinensai is a festival that was celebrated every year in ancient Japan on February 4th. It was an important observance of the government. It was held to pray for a good harvest. Emperor Tenmu started the festival in 675 as a rite of the Japanese government. He required all the shrines recorded in the Jinmyochō to perform it.

During the festival, tribute was offered to the gods, and the ceremony was attended by high-ranking officials, but the emperor himself did not participate. In the Heian period, the festival became a mere formality and was celebrated solely within the Department of Divinities, the body responsible for the governance of Shinto affairs by the government.

Later, the festival became more solemn and focused on worshipping Amaterasu Ōmikami, the sun goddess, and during the period of "cloistered emperors", it became a rite performed by the emperor himself to honor Amaterasu. Kinensai eventually became such a sacred ceremony that it would be canceled in case of any pollution at the Ise Shrines.

However, the festival died out at the end of the Muromachi period due to military conflict. It was later revived in an abbreviated, irregular form called sairō by the Shirakawa house, which had inherited the position of head of the Department of Divinities. Kinensai was not reintroduced until the Meiji period in 1869.

It is sometimes contrasted with or the fall festival.

UGC 12591

UGC 12591 is a spiral galaxy located about 400 million light years away from the Earth in the constellation Pegasus. Also, it is the spiral galaxy with the highest known rotational speed of about 500 km/s, almost twice the rotational speed of our galaxy, the Milky Way. The high rotational speed means the galaxy must be very massive at the center; the galaxy has a mass estimated at 4 times that of the Milky Way, making it the third most massive known spiral galaxy after ISOHDFS 27 and J2345-0449.
UGC 12591 is far from other galaxies; the nearest galaxy to it is 3.55 million light years away. However, it's shape shows that it probably had a merger or accretion event in its past. It looks somewhat lenticular-like, with a central bulge and dust lanes similar to the Sombrero Galaxy.

Ludwig Boltzmann

Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann (February 20, 1844 – September 5, 1906) was a well-known Austrian physicist, member of the Impreial Austrian Academy of Sciences. He was considered to build the foundations for scientific fields including statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics. He was one of the major contributors for atomic theory while the atomic model was still highly controversial. Besides Max Planck, he was also the first person who had ideas for quantum theory.

Boltzmann was born in Vienna, the capital of Austrian Empire. His father, Ludwig George Boltzmann, was a tax official. His mother, Katharina Pauernfeind, came from Salzburg. At childhood, his parents invited a private tutor to teach him. He then attended high school in Linz . When he was 15 years old, his father died.

Since 1863, Boltzmann studied physics at the University of Vienna. Some of his teachers were Johann Josef Loschmidt, Joseph Stefan, Andreas von Ettingshausen and Jozef Petzval. Boltzmann received his doctorate in 1866. In 1867, Boltzmann was already a university lecturer. After earning his doctorate, Boltzmann worked for two years as Stefan's assistant. Stefan then introduced him James Clerk Maxwell's work.

In 1869 at age 25, he was appointed full professor of mathematical physics at the University of Graz. In 1869 he spent several months working with Robert Bunsen and Leo Königsberger at Heidelberg . In 1871 he worked with Gustav Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz in Berlin. In 1873 Boltzmann went to the University of Vienna as a professor of mathematics and stayed there until 1876.

In 1872, he met Henriette von Aigentler, a math and physics teacher in Graz. In 1876, they got married and had three daughters and two sons. Boltzmann returned to Graz as head of the Department of Physics. About 14 years in Graz, he developed his concept of natural statistics. In 1885 he became a member of the Imperial Austrian Academy of Sciences and in 1887 he became President of the University of Graz.

In 1890, Boltzmann became head of the department of Theoretical Physics at the University of Munich in Germany .

In 1893, Boltzmann succeeded Joseph Stefan as Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Vienna.

Boltzmann was a classical physicist, but had a great influence on the modern physics including statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics. The Boltzmann equations are key ideas for non-equilibrium thermodynamics and reversible processes. Boltzmann also has great merit in formulating and defending the second law of thermodynamics, developing the definition of entropy from a purely statistical point of view.

The entropy equation, engraved on his tombstone, is Boltzmann's great scientific achievement:formula_1
The Boltzmann equation describes the dynamics of an ideal gas.


Huastvanift

Huastvanift also known as Xuastvanift is a Manichaean text written in the Uyghur language, containing a repentance prayer that Manichaean believers read to confess their sins.

It is believed that the Toyoura-no-miya Shrine (now Iminomiya-jinja Shrine) was where these silkworm seeds were introduced.

In 199, Empress Jingu established a shrine at the site of Toyoura Palace to enshrine Emperor Chuai, who died in Kashii, Tsukushi. This was done because the emperor doubted the oracle from Amaterasu Omikami and the three gods of Sumiyoshi. Later, Empress Jingu and Emperor Ojin were also enshrined during the reign of Emperor Shomu. The shrine was called the Sanden-separate. During the Middle Ages, due to a fire, all the shrines were enshrined in 'Iminomiya', which became the name of the shrine. In the Engishiki Jinmyocho, it is listed as 'Iminomiya Shrine, Toyoura District, Nagato Province,' and is listed as a small shrine.

In 1336, Ashikaga Takauji visited Iminomiya Shrine to pray for victory, and in 1337, he offered Horaku waka poems. The Chofu Mori family strongly supported the shrine, and a precinct shrine called Toyokou-jinja Shrine was established to enshrine the lords of the domain (now enshrined together with Miyazaki Hachimangu Shrine near the Chofu coast as Toyokou-jinja Shrine). The shrine has been highly respected as the god of literary and military prowess, victory, and safe childbirth by the common people since ancient times.




Kankō Shrine

Hamhung Shrine was a Shinto shrine in Hamgyong, Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The shrine was dedicated to the deities Amaterasu Omikami and Kunitama Omikami. It used to have the status of Kokuheishosha.

According to the Rules for Shrines and Temples (Ordinance No. 82 of the Office of the Governor-General of Korea in 1916), Hamhung Shrine was permitted to be established on August 21, 1916. The spirits of Amaterasu Omikami were sent from Ise Jingu Shrine and enshrined in the shrine on October 1, 1918.

In 1936 (Showa 11), on August 11, Hamhung Shrine was designated as a Dokushinsha Shrine, which means that offerings to the gods should be made directly at the shrine. To commemorate the 2600th year, the shrine buildings were expanded and reconstructed. On February 25, 1939 (Showa 14), a support meeting was organized as a part of the plan.

On June 15, 1943 (Showa 18), Kunitama Okami was also enshrined at Hamhung Shrine. On May 1, 1944 (Showa 19), it was made Kokuheishosha. However, following Japan's defeat in World War II, it was abolished on November 17, 1945 (Showa 20).

Nunakuma Shrine

Nunakuma Shrine is a Shinto shrine in Tomo, Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture. It is a Shikinaisha. Currently, it is a beppyo shrine under the Shinto shrine headquarters.

The shrine is commonly referred to as 'Gion-san' together with 'Tomogi Ongu'.

Two deities are enshrined at the shrine.


In the Meiji era, Watasu Shrine and Tomo Gion Shrine were combined and renamed as Numana Shrine according to the Engishiki Jinmyocho. according to the Shrine Consolidation Policy. The shrine continues to enshrine two deities, Owatatsumi-no-Mikoto and Susanoo-no-Mikoto, who were originally enshrined separately by each shrine. In addition, Watarimori Shrine, listed in the Engishiki Jinmyocho, is located on the side of the shrine and is still in operation today.

Legend has it that Watarimori Shrine, now known as Numana Shrine, was established in the second year of Emperor Chuai's reign. Empress Jingu headed to western Japan and enshrined Watatsumi-no-mikoto on a local sacred stone, praying for safe sea routes. On her way back, she reportedly said to Watatsumi no Mikoto, "Takatomo Izuno." The name "Tomo" is said to have originated from the fact that "tomo" was one of the tools used for bows.

In the Engishiki Jinmyocho, a document from the middle of the Heian period, there is a description of a Shikinaisha called 'Numakuma-jinja Shrine' located in Numakuma District, Bingo Province. The book offers two possible readings of the name, "Nunasaki" and "Nunakuma". However, the location of this Shikinaisha remained unknown. Through historical research after the early modern period, it is currently identified as Watarimori-jinja Shrine, but it is unclear whether it is located in Tomo.

In modern times, Watarimori Shrine is said to enshrine Sarutahiko-no-kami and Funatama-no-mikoto. The shrine was originally located in Gojihira Village or Tomonoseki-cho and was moved to its current location during the Keicho era (1596-1615) as a precinct shrine of Gion Shrine. In the Meireki era (1655-1658), the main shrine was rebuilt by the feudal lord Katsutada Mizuno.
The shrine itself has no information about the establishment of Tomo Gion Shrine. It is said to have been founded during the Tencho era (824-834) or during the Hojo era (1156-1159).

The deity enshrined at the Numana Shrine is Susanoo no Mikoto. The shrine was originally located in Tomonoseki-cho but was destroyed in a fire in 1599 and later relocated to its current location.

Some believe that the Tomo Gion Palace may be associated with the "Enokumanokuni Tsuyashiro" mentioned in an excerpt from the "Bingo Province Fudoki". The shrine was worshipped as the local deity of Tomo and received many donations from the lord of the Fukuyama domain, with a shrine site in the area.

The history of the two companies since the early modern period is as follows.




Kōgen Shrine

Kogen-jinja Shrine was a shrine located in Chuncheon-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea

The enshrined deities were Amaterasu Omikami, Emperor Meiji, Kunitama Omikami, and Susanoo no Mikoto. Sosawo-son was added to Mt. Gozu in Chuncheon, including Gisangbong Peak, as it was one of the identified places of Soshimori of Silla.

It was associated with imperialism and State Shinto rather than local belief in Shintoism.

  During that time, the government forced people to visit shrines instead of visiting them voluntarily.

Because of Japan's loss in World War II, the shrine was abolished on November 17, 1945.


Sugo Ishibe Shrine

Sugōisobe-jinja (菅生石部神社) is a Shinto shrine in Kaga, Ishikawa Prefecture, on the Daishōji grounds. It was mentioned in the engishiki of 927 and held the shakaku rank of kokuhei shōsha, which is the national shrine of the 3rd rank. During the feudal era, it was of the second-highest rank in Kaga Province. Currently, the shrine is directly controlled by the Association of Shinto Shrines. Locally, it is referred to as "Shikichi Tenjin" or "Sugō Tenjin."

The deity worshipped at Sugōisobe-jinja shrine is Sugōisobe no Kami. This name represents three deities, namely Hoori, Toyotama-hime no Mikoto, and Ugayafukiaezu no Mikoto.

There are several theories about the true identity of the deity at Sugōisobe-jinja shrine. Some scholars suggest that the deity is actually Sukunabikona, rather than Sugōisobe no Kami. 

According to legend, Sugōisobe no Kami was brought to the area from the imperial court in 585 when a serious illness spread throughout the region. The shrine was recorded in the engishiki jinmyōchō, a record of all shrines in Japan compiled in 927, as shōsha, and it held the second highest rank (ni no miya) in Kaga province. The shrine was highly respected by the imperial court and the samurai class, and in 940, the deity was elevated to shōshii no ge, an upper fourth rank, lower degree. The Heike monogatari, a Japanese epic of the 12th century, also mentioned that Minamoto no Yoshinaka donated to the shrine. During the Middle Ages, the entire area was incorporated into the territory of Kitano Tenmangū, and Sugōisobe-jinja came to be known as "Tenjin" due to the god worshipped there. A bull statue, associated with Tenjin, still stands as a reminder of that time.

Every year on February 10th, the Gongan Shinji festival, also known as "Takewari-matsuri," is held at Sugōisobe-jinja. In 1987, Ishikawa Prefecture designated the festival as an Intangible Cultural Heritage..

Kamigamo Shrine

, is a significant Shinto shrine located on the banks of the Kamo River in northern Kyoto. It was established in the year 678 and is formally called the Kamigamo Shrine is one of the oldest Shinto shrines in Japan and is considered a significant historical site. It is one of the seventeen landmarks in ancient Kyoto that has been recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In Japanese, the term "Kamo-jinja" refers to both Shimogamo Shrine and Kamigamo Shrine, which are traditionally linked Kamo shrines in Kyoto. These shrines have the important role of protecting Kyoto from negative influences.

The shrine name is given to identify the Kamo family of deities that are worshipped at Kamigamo Shrine. The name also refers to the surrounding woods, which are remnants of the original forest of Tadasu no Mori. Moreover, the shrine's name is a tribute to the Kamo clan, who were the early inhabitants of the area where the shrine is located. Many members of the Kamo clan still live near the shrine and continue to serve the deities that their ancestors had traditionally worshipped.

Kamogamo Shrine is dedicated to the veneration of Kamo Wake-ikazuchi, the "kami" of thunder.

During the early Heian period, Kamogamo Shrine gained the support and patronage of the Imperial family..

Historical records from the reign of Emperor Heizei (806-809) show that Kamogamo Shrine was one of the few establishments that received a divine seal from the Emperor for use on important documents. The seal was enshrined in its own mikoshi, which was called the Oshite jinja. This practice of granting a special seal and its associated customs of preservation and use were established during the reign of Emperor Kōnin (770-781) in 778, according to historical records.).

In 965, Emperor Murakami issued an order that Imperial messengers were to be dispatched to inform Japan's guardian kami, including Kamo Wake-ikazuchi, of significant events..

Kamigamo Shrine, along with Shimogamo Shrine, was selected as one of the two primary Shinto shrines (ichinomiya) for the former Yamashiro province..From 1871 to 1946, Kamigamo Shrine was recognized as one of the , which means it was a government-supported shrine that held a significant position as one of the highest-ranked shrines in Japan.


The shrine is famous for its "haiden" (worship hall) which was rebuilt in 1628-1629

Several residences for priests are located within the grounds of Kamigamo Shrine. One of these residences, the Nishimura House, is accessible to the general public.

Ajisukitakahikone

Ajisukitakahikone (also Ajishikitakahikone or Ajisukitakahiko) is a "kami" in Japanese mythology.

According to the Kojiki, Ajisukitakahikone is one of the two offspring of the deity Ōkuninushi and Takiribime, one of the three Munakata goddesses. The other offspring is Shitateruhime, who is also known as Takahime..

As a baby, Ajisukitakahikone's cries were so loud that he was put on a boat and sailed around Japan until he stopped crying. When he grew up, he became the father of Takitsuhiko, a god of rain.

Amaterasu and Takamimusubi, the rulers of Takamagahara, wanted their descendants to rule over the earth. They sent messengers to Ōkuninushi, the ruler of Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, to tell him to give up his power. One of the messengers, Ame-no-Wakahiko, married one of Ōkuninushi's daughters, Shitateruhime, and tried to take over the land himself. Eight years later, a pheasant sent by the heavenly gods came to Ame-no-Wakahiko and scolded him. Ame-no-Wakahiko shot and killed the bird, but the arrow he used was thrown back down to earth by the gods and struck Ame-no-Wakahiko in the chest, killing him in his sleep.

At Ame-no-Wakahiko's funeral, Ajisukitakahikone visited to pay his respects. He resembled Ame-no-Wakahiko, so the family mistook him for Ame-no-Wakahiko, who had come back to life. Ajisukitakahikone was angry about being mistaken for his friend because corpses were considered unclean. So, he drew his sword and destroyed the funeral hut where Ame-no-Wakahiko's corpse was kept and then kicked it away. The ruined hut landed in the land of Mino and became a mountain called Moyama (mourning mountain)..

Ajishikitakahikone was very angry and flew away. His radiance was so bright that it illuminated the space of two hills and two valleys. Shitateruhime wanted to let everyone know that it was her brother who came to pay respects, so she composed a song to honor him.:

Kamo Wake-ikazuchi is the deity enshrined at Kamo Wake-ikazuchi-jinja Shrine (also known as Kamigamo-jinja Shrine), and is worshipped at Kamo-jinja Shrines located in different areas. Kamo Wake-ikazuchi is not mentioned in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, the oldest known historical chronicles of Japan. However, in the "Kamo no Honchi" document from the Muromachi period, Kamo Wake-ikazuchi is identified with Ajisukitakahikone no kami, who is mentioned in the Kojiki and Nihonshoki.
According to a passage from the "Yamashiro no Kuni Fudoki," Kamo Wake-ikazuchi is described as follows: Tamayori-hime, who is also worshipped at Shimogamo Shrine, was the daughter of Kamo Takekakumi no Mikoto, who is the enshrined deity at Kamo-mioya-jinja Shrine. One day, Tamayori-hime was playing in the Semi no Ogawa (Kamo River) in Ishikawa when she saw a tannuri arrow floating down the river.
Tamayori-hime found a tannuri arrow while playing in the Kamo River. She took it home and placed it near her bed, which resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Kamo Wake-ikazuchi. As an adult, at a party, Kamo Wake-ikazuchi no Mikoto's grandfather, Kamo Takekakumi no Mikoto, gave him some sake and asked him to give some to his father. Kamo Wake-ikazuchi then passed through the roof and ascended to heaven, leading to the belief that his father was a god. The true identity of the tannuri arrow was believed to be the god of fire and thunder at Otokuni Shrine.




Shimogamo Shrine

, is a significant Shinto holy site located in Kyoto city's Sakyō ward in the Shimogamo district. The formal name of the shrine is .

Shimogamo Shrine is among the oldest Shinto shrines in Japan, dating back to the 6th century. It is also recognized as one of the seventeen Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto, designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The name Kamo-"jinja" refers generally to Shimogamo Shrine and Kamigamo Shrine, which are two traditionally linked shrines located in Kyoto. Shimogamo Shrine is the older of the two Kamo shrines in Kyoto, believed to be around 100 years older than Kamigamo. It dates back to the 6th century, which is centuries before Kyoto became Japan's capital in 794 (known as Heian-kyō). The Kamo-jinja serve the purpose of guarding Kyoto from harmful forces..

The term "jinja" denotes the deities of the Kamo family that are worshiped in the shrine. It also refers to the surrounding forest, which used to be a part of the ancient Tadasu forest (Tadasu no Mori). Additionally, the shrine's name honors the Kamo clan, the early inhabitants of the region, many of whom still reside in the area and have traditionally served the shrine.

Shimogamo Shrine honors the worship of Tamayori-hime (also known as 'the spirit-inviting maiden') and her father, Kamo Taketsunomi. Tamayori-hime is the mother of Kamo Wakeikazuchi, the thunder god of Kamo, and was impregnated by Honoikazuchi-no-mikoto, the God of Fire and Thunder.. The Kamigamo Shrine is a shrine in Kyoto and it is dedicated to Kamo Wakeikazuchi. This shrine worships gods that are related to thunder.



Tadasu no Mori

In the past, Tadasu no Mori was a large virgin forest spanning about 4,950,000 square meters. However, due to wars that occurred during the Middle Ages and a decree issued in the 4th year of the Meiji era, the forest was reduced to its current size of approximately 124,000 square meters..
The forest area known as Tadasu-no-mori is currently located within the grounds of Shimogamo Shrine, which is one of the seventeen historical sites in and around Kyoto. In 1994, these sites were designated by UNESCO as Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto.




Chinju no Mori

The name means "Guardian forest".

These forests may also surround temples, sando (approach paths), and other places of worship.

Chinju no mori refers to the Forest that surrounded many Shinto shrine"." The character "mori" is frequently used in this context. In certain instances, the term "shrine" (社) is written and pronounced as "mori," (森) indicating that Shrine Shinto may have originated from Koshinto where natural yorishiro such as kannabi or chinju no mori were more prevalent over built shrines.

In modern Shinto, people worship the shrine itself, which includes the main hall and other Shinto architecture decorated with shimenawa ropes. The surrounding forests are known as chinju-no-mori. However, in Koshinto, the original form of Shinto, nature itself is considered an object of faith, including Himorogi, Iwakura, Kannabi, forests, mountains, land covered with forests, seas, rivers, and other special places like reefs and waterfalls. People in Koshinto worship nature. Many sacred trees can be found in shrine precincts and mountains, including trees with unique trunks and branches, and large trees.

Shinto shrines were often constructed at the boundary between the eternal and present worlds or at sites with sacred rocks or stones. For instance, Omiwa Shrine in Nara Prefecture worships Mount Miwa, which is regarded as the Shintai. Some shrines don't have a main shrine or a Honden and instead use hills and forests as their sacred objects or Kannabi. These shrines follow the ancient form of Shinto, which is also known as animism in Japan.

Some Shinto shrines have forests called "Chinju no Mori" created by planting trees. Meiji Shrine is a famous example. Although some trees were donated from other countries, they tried to match the natural vegetation in the area. The goal is for the forest to look like a natural shrine forest through natural growth over time. Kasugayama Primeval Forest was registered as a World Heritage Site and was designated as a cultural heritage site instead of a natural heritage site because of this.

Township forests are believed to have been preserved since ancient times, making their forest vegetation an original part of the area's nature. They are one of the few remaining clues to the former nature of the area, as surrounding nature is often destroyed. Because of this, they are often surveyed and protected as natural monuments. In Forest ecology in Japan, township forests are emphasized and referred to as shrine and temple forests, as they are often associated with these religious sites. Similarly, the forests associated with Utaki in Okinawa are also valuable and protected.

It is important to note that the original vegetation in chinju forests may not have been fully preserved. If the surrounding area is developed and only the chinju forest remains isolated, the originally wide and continuous vegetation will have been fragmented. This can change the population in the area. For example, camphor, which is commonly seen in shrines, is not believed to have been originally found in the forests of central and southern Japan. Additionally, deciduous trees such as Keyaki and Mucunoki should not be present much in the climax community south of the plains in central Honshu.

In addition, fragmented vegetation does not provide enough space for animals to move around and maintain their populations. Therefore, animal communities in such areas are believed to be more degraded than plant communities. This is a problem because many plants require specific animals for pollination and seed dispersal. The degradation of animal communities can therefore affect the vegetation in various ways.

Humans also directly disturb the forest vegetation in shrine precincts. Non-native plants are often planted within the area. When a tree falls in the forest, the gap created by the fall is often filled by planting cedar or cypress, which is not necessarily the original vegetation of the area. Historical records show that forest resources within the precincts were utilized in advanced ways as early as the early modern period..
。Recently, some forests have been cleared and their leaves raked, but this type of maintenance is not necessary and can even cause more harm in natural forests. Additionally, forests are often cut off or trimmed due to road expansions or other reasons, which can destroy the forest's mantle and sod communities. As a result, the forest floor may dry out, leading to devastation. To restore these areas, concrete spraying is becoming more common, but this method is not conducive to natural recovery and can be harmful to the environment.

However, unlike the so-called satoyamas, which are forests tended to for human use, these forests are more familiar to people and are treated differently. They continue to have a certain presence.

In modern times, people think shinto deities are more abstract and don't care much about the forests in Shinto shrines. Some believers don't think they're necessary. Although some shrines are still well-respected, many shrine forests have been cut down to make way for things like road repairs and buildings. This has happened especially in cities, where forests have been completely lost. Some shrines only have torii gates and main shrines, and the importance of nature worship in shrines has decreased. However Meiji Jingu and Tadasu Forest are two highly preserved ones.

Before the Meiji era, villages had shrines of different sizes, and many of them had a forest for their Shinto shrine. However, the Shrine Consolidation Policy decree greatly reduced their numbers. As a result, many shrines were abolished, and their guardian forests were cut down. Minakata Kumagusu opposed Shrine merging as it would lead to large-scale destruction of nature due to logging.

The Shrine Consolidation Policy aimed to have only one shrine per village, but some think it was for controlling wood resources or by-products like camphor. Shrines in central Honshu and southward have many large camphor and tabunoki trees, which could have been sold for a high price.

It's now rare to see large plants of furan and sekkok on sacred trees in shrines due to the popularity of wildflowers. In the past, Minakata Kumagusu found a magnificent epiphytic orchid at a shrine in Wakayama Prefecture and happily told the priest. The priest was angry with him and scolded him for promoting something rare that could be stolen.

After the Pacific War, there was a lot of deforestation in Japan as part of national land development. This was not related to the Shinto religion. This caused people to start thinking about the negative consequences of too much development, depopulation, and a lack of land. As a result, initiatives such as the national trust movement were created to protect and restore forests and green spaces. The national trust movement has been successful in its efforts to conserve and rehabilitate forests and other vegetation. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, there was a focus on preserving and restoring the forests affected by the disaster.。



Himorogi

Himorogi are enclosed with shimenawa ropes suspended from poles. There are usually four poles in a square shape. The poles are normally made from green bamboo or "sakaki." 

At the center of the himorogi is a branch of sakaki or some other type of evergreen, which represents the physical presence of the kami - a divine being that is incorporeal. It is a yorishiro. The himorogi is a simple yet important structure in Shinto worship.

The Aoi Festival in Kyoto features a more elaborate version of the himorogi, which is a square area enclosed by green branches and features an evergreen tree at the center as a yorishiro. Another variation of the himorogi involves using a straw mat on the ground and placing a ceremonial 8-legged stand, called an hassoku-an, on top of it. The hassoku-an is adorned with shimenawa and other sacred emblems..

The origin of the word "himorogi" is uncertain, but it is found in ancient Japanese texts such as the Nihon Shoki and the Man'yōshū. In Shinto, the term "himorogi" is used to describe both the sacred space and the tree at the center of the space. Both the tree and the space are considered to be pure and sacred.

In Japan, at construction sites, people often build a Himorogi. It is a sacred space where a Shinto priest comes to bless the site before work begins. The Himorogi is usually left standing for some time after the ceremony. This is a part of a traditional ground-breaking ritual called .

Jichinsai

Jichinsai is a festival in Japanese culture. It happens before construction starts on a new building. 

People do the ritual to ask for permission from the landlord deity to make a building on their land.

It is a way to pray for safety during the construction. The contractor, who makes the building, pays for the festival. This includes the and offerings. The owner and other people involved help pay, too. People set up a Himorogi at the space in order to do the ceremony.

The ceremony is held in the presence of builders, designers, and clients. A wooden platform is set up, and in the center is an altar on which offerings such as rice, sake, fish, vegetables, salt, and water are placed. In some cases, sand or salt from the beach near Ise Grand Shrine may be used. Five-colored silk banners, called Masakaki, are used in the ritual

The Tsu Jichinsai lawsuit in 1971 declared the rite secular.

People often pray to the land gods for a bountiful harvest and protection during farming activities. In the beginning of spring, they pray for a successful harvest and safety, while in early autumn, they express gratitude for a good harvest and pray for safety in the upcoming year. This ceremony is usually attended by farmers and is held at a nearby shrine managed by the community or at a location with a rope tied to a rock.

In Buddhism, there is a practice called jichinho, chintaku ho, anchinho, jitenku, or jimatsuri, which is commonly known as a ground-breaking ceremony. In esoteric Buddhism, there is a ceremony called Chintaku Fudoho where Fudo Myo-o is the principal image. This ceremony is performed before building a hall, a Buddhist pagoda, or a tombstone, where a boundary is formed on the land. The ceremony is centered on the earth and heaven, and involves the heavenly gods and death gods. It is held to prevent hindrance from the dead souls and to requisition them forever.

When constructing a hall, there is a method called chindanho, where the altar is built without laying a plank. The ground and chindan (altar) are then repaired separately. Sometimes both methods are used simultaneously. A kenbo containing five treasures and seven treasures is buried in the center of the altar, and a flat stone called chinseki is placed on it. The eight directions are then filled with rings, kui, and five balls.

In the Nichiren Shoshu sect, the ground-breaking ceremony is held as a "construction ceremony" to purify the land with the power of the principal image and to pray for the safety of the construction. The ceremony involves setting up an altar at the center of the construction site and raising the principal image of the temple that will be built.

The general flow of Shinto groundbreaking ceremonies is as follows.


After the Shinto groundbreaking ceremony is completed, a Naorai meeting is usually held. During the Naorai, participants share sacred sake and enjoy the leftovers from the offerings. In addition to the Shinto ritual, a casual gathering may be arranged where beer, boxed lunches, and other refreshments are provided. Alternatively, participants may rent a banquet hall at a restaurant to celebrate with a feast.

The Izumo Taisha holds a special Shinto ritual known as "" to honor the Okuninushi, the supreme deity of the land, and pray for the peace and stability of the land. During this ritual, the 'Goshinto', which is the soil of Izumo Taisha, is buried in the mansion, making it a place ruled by Okuninushi Okami. This is said to eliminate demon gates, attacks, azimuths, and obstacles, leading to prosperity. The traditional rituals of Izumo Taisha are followed, including special features such as three chanting of divine words, burial of sacred soil, and four clapping. After the Izumo mansion, the Izumo annual tribute is offered, and some first fruits are donated every year.

War in Sudan (2023–present)

On 15 April 2023, clashes happened across Sudan, especially in and around the capital city Khartoum, as well as Darfur, between rival factions of the current military government. By 19 December, at least 12,000 people died and more than 33,000 people were injured.

The fighting began with attacks on key government sites such as Khartoum where gunfire and explosions were reported. As of 15 April 2023, Leader of the RSF Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo and "de facto" leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan claimed to control key government sites such as the general military headquarters, Sudan TV headquarters and the Presidential Palace.

On 17 April, the governments of Kenya, South Sudan and Djibouti stated that they could send their presidents to Sudan to act as mediators. However, Khartoum Airport was closed due to fighting making arrival by air difficult.

The history of conflicts in Sudan has consisted of foreign invasions and resistance, ethnic tensions, religious disputes, and competition over resources. In its modern history, two civil wars between the central government and the southern regions led to the deaths of 1.5 million, and a continuing conflict in the western region of Darfur has displaced two million people and killed more than 200,000 people. Since independence in 1956, Sudan has had more than fifteen military coups and it has also been ruled by the military for the majority of the republic's existence, with only brief periods of democratic civilian rule.

Former president Omar al-Bashir presided over the War in Darfur, a region in the west of the country, and oversaw violence sponsored by the state in the region of Darfur, leading to charges of war crimes and genocide. Around 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million people were forced to be removed because of the conflict. The intensity of the violence later declined.

On 15 April, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) attacked multiple bases used by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) including bases in the capital of Khartoum like Khartoum International Airport. The clashes around the state broadcaster Sudan TV, which was eventually captured by RSF forces. Bridges and roads in Khartoum were closed with the RSF claiming that all roads south of Khartoum were closed. On 16 April, the SAF announced the arrests of multiple RSF officers, the rescue of the major general and brigadier and the capture of Merowe Airport.The Sudan Civil Aviation Authority closed the countries airspace. The provider MTN also shut down internet services. Clashes started again on 17 April in Khartoum, Omdurman and Merowe Airport. The SAF claimed control of the Sudan TV headquarters in Khartoum, and the RSF released a video on twitter.

Fighting continued in Khartoum between the SAF and RSF. The SAF accused the RSF of assaulting civilians as well as looting and burning.

Mu Columbae

Mu Columbae (also known as μ Col or μ Columbae) is a main sequence star in the constellation of Columba. It is one of the few O-class stars that are visible to the naked eye. The star is known to be located about 1,300 light years from the Solar System (with an error margin of a few hundred light years).

This is a relatively fast rotating star that completes a full revolution about every 1.5 days. (Compare this to the Sun, which at only 22% of this star's diameter rotates only once every 25.4 days.) This rate of rotation is fairly usual for stars of this class.

Based on measurements of proper motion and radial velocity, astronomers know that this star and AE Aurigae are moving away from each other at a relative velocity of over 200 km/s. Their common point of origin connects with Iota Orionis in the Trapezium cluster, some two and half million years in the past. The most likely scenario that could have created these runaway stars is a collision between two binary star systems, with the stars being ejected along different trajectories radial to the point of intersection.

Battle of Thapsus

The Battle of Thapsus was a significant event in Roman history, marking the final conflict of the Roman Republic's civil war. It pitted the forces of Julius Caesar against those of the Optimates, a group of senators and aristocrats who opposed Caesar's rise to power. The battle took place on April 6, 46 BC, near the city of Thapsus in modern-day Tunisia.

Caesar's Return to Rome

After defeating Pompey in Greece, Julius Caesar returned to Rome to consolidate his power. He was declared dictator for life in February of 44 BC, which made him the most powerful man in the Roman world. However, his enemies, particularly the Optimates, were still not satisfied. They saw him as a threat to the traditional Roman values and the Senate's authority.

The Situation in North Africa

Metellus Scipio, a prominent Optimate leader, had regrouped in North Africa with Pompey's remnants and many Numidian cavalry. Cato the Younger, another staunch opponent of Caesar, had also joined the Optimates in Africa. Scipio was declared commander-in-chief of the army, and the group was able to gather a significant force to challenge Caesar's power.

Caesar's Strategy

Caesar knew that he had to act fast and decisively to crush his enemies in North Africa. He raised an army of veterans and marched south, cutting off the Optimates' supply lines as he went. His army was battle-hardened, and he had the support of many experienced commanders, including Mark Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus.

Caesar arrived in Africa in January of 46 BC, and he immediately set about attacking the Optimates' strongholds. His first target was the city of Ruspina, which he captured after a brief siege. This victory gave him a much-needed boost in morale and allowed him to consolidate his position.

The Battle of Thapsus

The Optimates knew that they could not let Caesar take control of North Africa, and they decided to make a stand near the city of Thapsus. They had a large army, including many Numidian cavalry, and they were well-entrenched. The battle that followed was fierce and brutal, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

The Optimates had the advantage of numbers, but Caesar had the advantage of superior tactics and discipline. He managed to outmaneuver his opponents and cut off their escape routes. The Optimates fought bravely, but in the end, they were no match for Caesar's army.

Aftermath

The Battle of Thapsus was a decisive victory for Julius Caesar. The Optimates suffered heavy casualties, and many of their leaders, including Metellus Scipio and Cato the Younger, fled or committed suicide rather than be captured. Caesar emerged as the undisputed master of the Roman world, with no one left to challenge his authority.

However, the victory at Thapsus marked the beginning of the end for Caesar himself. His actions in North Africa had alienated many of his supporters in Rome, and his opponents saw him as a tyrant who needed to be stopped. On March 15, 44 BC, he was assassinated by a group of senators led by Brutus and Cassius.

Conclusion

The Battle of Thapsus was a significant event in Roman history, marking the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire. It was a hard-fought battle, with both sides displaying incredible bravery and determination. In the end, Julius Caesar emerged as the victor, but his victory was short-lived. His assassination marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new one, with Rome ruled by a series of emperors rather than by the Senate.

Motettu de tristura

"Motettu de tristura" (Sardinian language; "sad ditty") is a traditional Sardinian folk song composed by an anonymous author and rewritten by Luciano Berio for voice (mezzo-soprano), flute, clarinet, harp, percussion, viola and cello.
The music and words of the piece, known as "Tristu passirillanti" ("Sad nightingale"), were collected by Berio in the village of Guasila (Province of South Sardinia). The text in Campidanese sardinian is composed of two stanzas of five septenary lines each.

Luciano Berio set it for soprano and ensemble as part of his "Folk Songs" in 1964: the song cycle was composed for, and recorded by, Cathy Berberian.

It is the desperate song of a woman who, overcome with grief over the loss of her lover, perhaps because he is dead, turns to a nightingale, and asks him why he advised her to cry for her lover. She is probably convinced that it is completely useless; in fact in the following verses he asks him to sing this song to him after she is dead.

Shinto architecture

Shinto architecture is the architecture of Japanese Shinto shrines.

In Japan, the practice of designating sacred areas started in the Yayoi period (500 BC - 300 AD) based on the fundamental beliefs of Shintoism. Land features like mountains, waterfalls, rocks, and islands were considered capable of drawing kami and hence were revered as yorishiro.. 
In the beginning, sacred locations were likely marked with only a fence surrounding the area and a torii gate, at the entrance. Afterwards, temporary structures resembling modern portable shrines were built to receive the deities at the holy site.
As time passed, the temporary structures used to welcome the gods evolved into permanent structures that were dedicated solely to the gods. Ancient shrines were constructed in different styles such as dwellings (for example, Izumo Taisha) or storehouses (for example, Ise Grand Shrine).
The ancient shrine buildings had gabled roofs, raised floors, plank walls, and were either thatched with reed or covered with hinoki cypress bark.. In the past, the early shrines didn't have an area for people to worship.. Three important forms of architecture styles exist: , , and . 

Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha have each type respectively and were built at or before 552. 
The tradition of Shikinen sengū-sai states that buildings or shrines are regularly rebuilt according to the original design. This has been done throughout the centuries to preserve ancient styles up to the present day..

The following is a diagram illustrating the most important elements of a Shinto shrine:

Hukou

Hukou is a system of household registration used in mainland China. It officially identifies a person as a permanent resident of a place. It has information about name, parents, spouse and date of birth. A "hukou" can also refer to a family register. The household register is for a family, and usually includes the births, deaths, marriages, divorces, and moves, of all the people in the family. A person's residence is tied to their place of birth or their parent's place of birth. Hukou registration limits the types of jobs a person can do in a city and the types of housing they are able to stay in.

The government gives people benefits based on agricultural and non-agricultural residency status (often called rural and urban). Urban residents got retirement pensions, education and health care, while rural people got none of those things. They had to build their own homes and grow their own food. Migration inside China was controlled by the government. It was difficult to move from the country into a city. People who moved without permission had to work in very bad conditions as they had no rights.

After 1978 controls were not so strict. Migrant workers could get temporary residency permits, but they generally got worse jobs and get less money. They often had to leave their children behind in the rural area. If the children came to the city they may not be able to go to public schools or colleges. By 2016, the government had given urban hukou to about 28.9 million rural migrants. People were more likely to get an urban hukou if they owned their home or if they had qualifications. In the special economic zones of China - Shenzhen, Shantou, and Zhuhai in Guangdong province and Xiamen located in Fujian province people were allowed to have both rural and urban houkou. 

Rural hukou holders have property rights over the land which urban people dont have. 

In Hong Kong and Macau there is no houkou system, but people do have to have identification cards. 

Shimenawa

Shimenawa (標縄/注連縄/七五三縄, lit. 'enclosing rope') are ropes used for ritual purification in the Shinto religion.

Shimenawa come in different sizes, ranging from a few centimeters to several meters in diameter, and are often adorned with shide, which are traditional paper streamers. When a space is enclosed by shimenawa, it is considered sacred or ritually pure, such as in a Shinto shrine. Shimenawa are believed to ward off evil spirits and are commonly used in Jichinsai before constructing new buildings. They are also commonly found at Shinto shrines, torii gates, and other sacred landmarks.

Shimenawa, are also placed on objects believed to attract spirits or be inhabited by them, known as yorishiro. This includes trees called shinboku, with the spirits believed to inhabit them known as kodama. Cutting down these trees is considered to bring misfortune. Similarly, stones believed to be inhabited by spirits are known as .




Shrine Shinto

Shrine Shinto is a form of the Shinto religion which emphasizes ritual over belief. It has two main varieties: State Shinto which was controlled by the Japanese government, and another centered on Shinto shrines after World War II.

In the Empire of Japan Shrine Shinto was considered secular due to Secular Shrine Theory and only Sect Shinto was considered religious. This is because they argued belief made something a religion, and not ritual.

Today, the term "Shinto" commonly refers to Shrine Shinto. Shrine Shinto is the most common form of Shinto.. Prior to 1945, all Shinto shrines were under the jurisdiction of the Institute of Divinities, which was an external department of the Home Ministry. After World War II the Shinto Directive issued by the General Headquarters of the Allied Forces (GHQ) in December 1945 abolished the Institute of Divinities and reorganized it into one religious corporation, known as the Association of Shinto Shrines.

Shinto shrines and their rituals are conducted in accordance with sacred texts such as the "Kojiki" and "Nihon Shoki", which are considered important scriptures in Shintoism. The Kannushi, who hold positions such as priests, priests-in-charge, and administrators of the rituals, are responsible for conducting these rituals. However, the miko, who are female attendants at Shinto shrines, are not considered part of the priesthood in Shintoism. While a Kagura dancer, who performs traditional Shinto dance, may participate in Shinto rituals, they are not authorized to preside over or perform the rituals in a priestly role.


Yoshida Shrine

The royal family started supporting the shrine in the Heian period. In 965, Emperor Murakami of Japan issued an order to send Imperial messengers, known as heihaku, to report significant events to the guardian kami (deities) of the country. Initially, these heihaku were presented to 16 shrines, and later in 991, Emperor Ichijō added three more shrines to the list, including Yoshida Shrine.
From 1871 through 1946, the Yoshida Shrine was a in the Modern system of ranked Shinto shrines. Yoshida Kanetomo, founder of Yoshida Shinto, is buried here.



Yasakatome

Yasaka Tome no Kami (八坂刀売神) is a Shinto goddess.

She is considered to be the concubine of no Kami, the enshrined deity of Shrine, and is enshrined at Suwa Taisha Shitasha and Suwa Shrines in various places. She is not found in the Kojiki or the Nihonshoki, and is thought to be a unique god associated with Suwa.

Although the name of Yasaka Tome no Kami is unknown, one theory suggests that 'Yasaka' is similar to 'Iyasaka,' and her divine name is thought to mean 'an increasingly prosperous woman' (). 

There are different ideas about where Yasaka Tome no Kami came from because she is a goddess that is not mentioned in the ancient texts "Kojiki" or "Nihonshoki," and we only have incomplete stories about her.

There are different theories about Yasaka Tome no Kami's origin. One theory suggests that she was from the Azumi clan. According to the legend of Kawai-jinja Shrine in Kitaazumi-gun, she is believed to be the daughter of Watatsumi no Mikoto and the younger sister of Hotakami. Another theory proposes that she is the daughter of Amayasakahiko no Mikoto, who descended from heaven following Nigihayahi no Mikoto. However, this theory is based on the name of the same god in the Edo period and may not have strong historical evidence

There is a legend that Omiwatari (cracks that form in the ice on Lake Suwa) are formed when Takeminakata no kami, the god enshrined at kami sha (southern shrine building in Suwa taisha Shrine) visits shimo sha (northern shrine building in Suwa taisha Shrine) enshrining Yasakatome no kami.

It is said that her father was Amenoyasakahiko no mikoto and that Yasakairihime no mikoto was her younger sister. Another folkloric myth says that Yasakatome no kami was a daughter of Watatsumi and a younger sister of Hotakami no mikoto.





Oyamakui no Kami

Oyamakuhi no kami is a Japanese deity. He is worshipped at Hiyoshi Taisha.

He is the son of Toshigami.

Oyamakui is recorded in Kojiki, written in the 8th century AD, which states that this god resides at Mount Hiei, which is located immediately to the east of Hiyoshi Taisha. This "kami" was relocated from the summit of the mountain to its present location in the seventh year of the reign of the semi-legendary Emperor Sujin, or 90 BC per the traditional calendar.

Tagata Shrine

Tagata Shrine is a small shrine located in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. It a Shikinaisha and was previously designated as Go-sha.

Tagata Shrine is famous for its Harvest Festival Hōnensai held annually in March. The old character form of 'ken' is written as '碣' (agata, ken), and sometimes used to represent Tagata Shrine.

It is near Ōagata jinja which has a similar yonic festival the day before

The deities enshrined here are Toshigami and Tamahime no Mikoto, gods of bountiful harvests and prosperity of descendants. According to the shrine's legend, this area was part of the residence of Oarata no Mikoto, and the goddess of a bountiful harvest was enshrined in the residence. Tamahime no Mikoto was the daughter of Oarata no Mikoto, and after her husband died, she returned to her parents' home and raised her children splendidly as a mother while helping her father to develop the area. It is said that

Within the grounds of Tagata Shrine, there are several stones that have been carved into the shape of phalluses.

The exact year of foundation for Tagata Shrine is unknown, but it is considered to be a fairly old shrine with roots in indigenous beliefs. It is known for combining beliefs related to fertility and agriculture. In historical records such as Engishiki Jinmyocho, it is identified as 'Tagata-jinja Shrine, Niwa-gun, Owari Province', and in 'Owari National Shrine' in 1364 as 'Junior Third Rank Uedakata Tenjin'. The shrine was later relocated to its current location in the former Kasugai County.

The harvest festival, known as 'Hounensai' or 'Hounen Matsuri', is held on March 15th every year at Tagata Shrine. It is also commonly referred to as the 'Henoko Festival'. During this festival, men carry a mikoshi (portable shrine) in the shape of a phallus called Oowasegata, while mikos carry smaller phallic-shaped portable shrines. According to legend, touching the mikoshi is believed to bring fertility and the blessing of having a child. The giant stem of the mikoshi is approximately 60 centimeters in diameter and over 2 meters long, making it a significant and prominent feature of the festival.

During the Hōnensai or Hounen Matsuri festival, the phallus is symbolized as 'heaven' and the female yin as 'earth'. The festival serves as a prayer for abundant harvests of the five grains through the blessings of heaven and the moistening of the earth, as well as for blessings of children. The festival is held in spring, which also represents the birth of new life, further emphasizing the connection between fertility, agriculture, and the cycle of life in this indigenous belief system.
In Inuyama City, there is another festival called Hounen Matsuri (or Ososo Matsuri) at Ōagata jinja. This festival includes floats shaped like a vulva, which complement the phallic-shaped mikoshi used in the festival.
Souvenirs of phallic-shaped candies, chocolates, and objects are available for sale at the festival.

In recent years, the festival has gained popularity among foreign tourists, and many visitors from abroad also come to experience it.

During the Hounensai festival, multiple parking lots near the shrine are available for visitors to use.

88 modern constellations by area

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) names 88 constellations of stars. In the table below, they are ranked by the solid angle that they subtend in the sky, measured in square degrees and millisteradians.

These solid angles depend on borders between the constellations: the list below is based on constellation borders drawn up by Eugène Delporte in 1930 for the IAU and published in "Délimitation scientifique des constellations" (Cambridge University Press). Before Delporte's work, there was no standard list of the borders of each constellation.

Delporte drew the borders along vertical and horizontal lines of right ascension and declination; however, he did so for the epoch B1875.0, which means that due to precession of the equinoxes, the borders on a modern star map (e.g., for epoch J2000) are already somewhat distorted and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal. This distortion will increase over the centuries to come. However, this does not change the solid angle of any constellation.

Confucian Shinto

Confucian Shinto is a Japanese religious tradition. It started in Japan during a time called the Edo period. This was from 1603 to 1868. It mixes parts of Confucianism and Shinto. Confucianism is a Chinese way of thinking and acting. Shinto is the original religion of Japan. Some people also call Confucian Shinto "Neo-Confucian Shinto". This is because it uses parts of Confucian teachings in Shinto beliefs and ways.
There are groups today linked with Confucian Shinto. These groups are Shinto Taiseikyo, Shinto Shusei, and Tsuchimikado Shinto. Suika Shinto was a known school of Confucian Shinto but no longer exists, it was founded by Yamazaki Ansai.

Confucian Shinto started in the 17th century. This is when Japanese people started to read Chinese Confucian books. They put Confucian ideas into their understanding of Shinto. A big name in this was Yamazaki Ansai. He lived from 1618 to 1682. He made a mix of Confucianism and Shinto. This mix focused on good behavior and respect for parents.

A student of Ansai, Kaibara Ekken, further developed these ideas. Ekken lived from 1630 to 1714. He wrote many important books on Confucian Shinto. One of these books is called the "Greater Learning for Women." Ekken's books stressed the need for education and becoming good. He said Confucian ethics should be part of daily life.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Confucian Shinto became more liked by the samurai class. They thought it helped them balance their duty to the emperor with their Confucian ideas. These ideas were about loyalty, honor, and being right. Regular people also liked Confucian Shinto. They were drawn to its focus on family values and everyday ethics. A thought by Wang Yangming was very important to Confucian Shinto. This thought was about the unity of knowledge and action.

Confucian Shinto had a significant impact on Japanese society during the Edo period and beyond. It helped to shape the moral values and social norms of the samurai class, and played a role in the development of modern Japanese nationalism.

Confucian Shinto also had an influence on the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which marked the end of the Edo period and the beginning of modern Japan. The leaders of the restoration sought to revive traditional Japanese values and culture, and saw Confucian Shinto as a way to do so. They promoted the idea of kokutai, or the "national essence", which was based on the Confucian notion of the ruler-subject relationship and the Shinto idea of the emperor as a divine being. Fukko Shinto which was also quite significant developed in reaction to Confucian Shinto, and it was the predecessor to State Shinto.

In Sect Shinto, Shinto Taiseikyo and Shinto Shusei are groups with Confucian influence. Tsuchimikado Shinto also carries on this legacy. But it is not a member of the Sect Shinto association.

The Mōri clan was a group of Japanese samurai that originated from Ōe no Hiromoto, who was a descendant of the Fujiwara clan. One of their most famous members, Mōri Motonari, greatly increased the clan's influence in Aki Province. During the Edo period, Motonari's descendants became daimyō (feudal lords) of the Chōshū Domain under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. However, after the Meiji Restoration, which abolished the han system and daimyō, the Mōri clan became part of the new nobility.

Hoori

Hoori (also known as Hikohohodemi no Mikoto or Yamasachi-hiko) is a character in Japanese mythology. He is the third and youngest son of Ninigi-no-Mikoto and , the blossom princess. Hoori is considered an ancestor of the Emperors of Japan and the grandfather of Emperor Jimmu.

Hoori's story is told in ancient Japanese texts called the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki. Hoori was a hunter who had an argument with his older brother Hoderi, a fisherman, over a fish-hook that Hoori had borrowed but lost. Hoderi insisted that Hoori return the exact same fish-hook, as each tool was believed to have its own unique spirit. To find the lost hook, Hoori went to the bottom of the sea where he met Toyotama-hime, the daughter of the sea god Ryūjin. With the sea god's help, Hoori found Hoderi's lost hook and eventually married Toyotama-hime.

Hoori and his wife lived in a palace beneath the sea for three years, but Hoori began to feel homesick and wanted to return to his own country. His brother forgave him after he returned the lost hook, and Toyotama-hime gave birth to their son, Ugayafukiaezu. However, during Toyotama-hime's childbirth, she made Hoori promise not to peek at her true form. But Hoori broke his promise and saw that she was actually a dragon, specifically a wani. Toyotama-hime was embarrassed and returned to her father, never to return. Ugayafukiaezu married Toyotama-hime's sister, Tamayori-hime, who raised him, and she gave birth to Emperor Jimmu, the first Emperor of Japan. Hoori ruled over Takachiho in Hyūga Province for 560 years.

Hoori is often linked to his parents and wife in Japanese mythology. He is primarily revered as a deity associated with cereals or grains. In Japanese mythology, it was believed that the "ho" part of his name meant fire, but it actually refers to crops, specifically rice, represented by a different character pronounced "ho" (穂). "Ori" (折り, to bend) signifies a bountiful crop that bends under its own weight. Another name for Hoori, Hohodemi, means "many harvests."


Toyotama-hime

Toyotama, also known as Toyotamahime or Toyotama-hime, married Prince Hoori. However, she returned to the sea when he broke his vow not to spy on her while she was going through childbirth. The child she gave birth to was named Ugayafukiaezu.



Ikukunitama Shrine

Ikukunitama Shrine (生國魂神社, "Ikukunitama jinja") is a Shinto shrine located in Tennōji-ku, Osaka Prefecture, Japan. It holds a big festival on September 9. It it used to be a first rank shrine (官幣大社, "kanpei taisha") in the Modern system of ranked Shinto Shrines.


Toshigami

Ōtoshi, also known as Ōtoshi-no-kami or Nigihayahi-no-mikoto, is a deity in the Shinto religion of Japan. Often referred to as Toshigami or Ōtoshi-no-kami, this god is associated with the passage of time and is often considered as the "Year God" or the "Great-Year God" due to their connection with the changing of years in Japanese traditions.

Ōtoshi is believed to be the son of the deities Susanoo and Kamu'ō-ichi-hime. He is the older brother of Inari.


Hōnensai

The Harvest Festival, known as Hōnensai in Japan, is a fertility festival that takes place annually on March 15th. The word "Hōnen" means "prosperous year" in Japanese, signifying a plentiful harvest, and "matsuri" refers to a festival or celebration. The Hōnen festival and ceremony are held to express gratitude for a bountiful harvest and to celebrate prosperity and fertility in various forms. 

The venerated Shinto deities in this context are Mitoshi (御歳神, Mitoshi-no-kami) and Tamahime (玉姫命, Tamahime-no-mikoto). Mitoshi is the son of Toshigami (年神) or locally known as Ōtoshi (大歳神, Ōtoshi-no-kami), a male Shinto deity, and the grandson of Susanoo, another Shinto deity. Tamahime is a princess and the daughter of Ō'arata (大荒田命, Ō'arata-no-Mikoto), the matriarch of the Owari clan (尾張氏), and her husband Take'inadane (健稲種命, Take'inadane-no-mikoto), who had two sons and four daughters. After her husband's death, she returned to his hometown Arata (situated close to Komaki) and, with the help of her father Ō'arata, encouraged cultivation and achieved his accomplishments in his honor.

The most well-known of these festivals occurs in the town of Komaki, located just north of Nagoya City in Japan. The festival is characterized by Shinto priests playing musical instruments, a parade of participants dressed in ceremonial attire, free-flowing sake (Japanese rice wine) for all to enjoy, and a prominent wooden phallus as a symbol of fertility.

The festival involves carrying a large wooden phallus called "youbutsu" or "ō-owase-gata," which weighs 280 kg (620 pounds) and measures 2.5 meters (96 inches) in length. The phallus is made of Japanese cypress and is estimated to be 200-250 years old. It is carried from a shrine called Shinmei Sha in Komaki on a large hill during even-numbered years, or from Kumano-sha Shrine during odd-numbered years, to a shrine called Tagata Jinja in Komaki, Tagata, Aichi Prefecture.

The festival begins with celebrations and preparations at 10:00 a.m. at Tagata Jinja, where various types of food and souvenirs, often in the shape of phallus or related themes, are sold. Free sake is also distributed from large wooden barrels. Around 2:00 p.m., everyone gathers at Shinmei Sha to start the procession. Shinto priests perform prayers and blessings for the participants, mikoshi (portable shrines), and the large wooden phallus, which will be carried along the parade route.

As the procession reaches Tagata Jinja, the wooden phallus in its mikoshi is spun vigorously before being set down, and additional prayers are offered. Afterwards, everyone gathers in the square outside Tagata Jinja and eagerly awaits the mochi nage, a highlight of the festival. During the mochi nage, officials throw small rice cakes down from raised platforms, showering the crowd with these treats. The festival typically concludes around 4:30 p.m.

Munakata Taisha

Munakata Taisha is a group of three Shinto shrines located in Munakata, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. It is considered the head shrine among approximately 6,000 Munakata shrines throughout the country. While the name Munakata Taisha refers to all three shrines - Hetsu-gū, Nakatsu-gū, and Okitsu-gū - it is commonly used to specifically refer to Hetsu-gū. As mentioned in Japan's second oldest book, Nihon Shoki, the shrines are dedicated to the three Munakata goddesses known as Munakata-sanjojin.

These deities, known as Munakata-sanjojin, are believed to be either daughters of the goddess Amaterasu, who is considered the ancestress of the imperial family, or daughters of Susanoo, who has been worshipped at Munakata Taisha as the god of mariners for many years. Over time, Susanoo has also come to be revered as the god of traffic safety on land.

Munakata Taisha is also home to many Japanese treasures. Hetsu-gū's "honden" (main shrine) and "haiden" (main prayer hall) are both designated Important Cultural Properties and the precincts are a Historic Site

Munakata Taisha is not only a place of worship, but also home to many precious Japanese treasures. The honden (main shrine) and haiden (main prayer hall) of Hetsu-gū are designated as Important Cultural Properties, and the entire precincts are recognized as a Historic Site. In addition, the shrine's treasure hall called Shinpō-kan, located at the southwest corner of Hetsu-gū's grounds, holds numerous valuable relics, including six National Treasures of Japan. The Shinpō-kan houses over 120,000 artifacts that were excavated on Okinoshima, an island associated with Munakata Taisha..

All three shrines of Munakata Taisha are located in Fukuoka Prefecture, but they are situated on separate islands. The main shrine, Hetsu-gū, is located on the mainland of Kyūshū. Nakatsu-gū is situated at the base of Mt. Mitake on the island of Ōshima, which is off the west coast of Kyūshū. The last shrine, Okitsu-gū, is located on the island of Okinoshima, which is situated in the middle of the Genkai Sea. The entire island of Okinoshima is considered sacred, and as a result, women are not allowed to set foot on the island. Men must also perform a purification ceremony before landing on Okinoshima according to the shrine's customs..

In 2009, the three shrines of Munakata Taisha were submitted for potential inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of a serial nomination called "Okinoshima Island and Related Sites in Munakata Region.".

In July, 2017 Japan's Okinoshima Island gained UNESCO World Heritage Status.

Hiroshima Electric Railway

. is a company in Japan. It runs streetcars and buses in and around Hiroshima Prefecture, and is commonly referred to as "Hiroden" for short.

The company has a diverse collection of trams from various parts of Japan and Europe, which has earned it the nickname "The Moving Streetcar Museum".

From January 2008 the company has accepted PASPY, a smart card ticket system.

This is the longest tram network in Japan, with .

On 6 August 1945, Hiroshima was devastated by the atomic bombing during World War II. The bombing resulted in the deaths of 185 employees of the local tramway company and caused damage or destruction to 108 out of its 123 trams. However, within just three days, the tramway system resumed operations. Remarkably, three trams that survived or were rebuilt after the bombing are still in operation even 75 years later..


Futodama

Futodama () is a god in Japanese mythology who is believed to be the ancestor of the Inbe clan. The characteristics of Futodama are believed to reflect the functions of the clan as court ritualists..

Wakoku

Wakoku was the name used by early China and its neighboring states to refer to what is now known as Japan. There are different ideas about how much power the early kings of Japan had. 

According to ancient Chinese books like the Book of Sui and the History of the Northern Dynasties, the borders of Japan were described as being five months from east to west and three months from north to south. 

The Wajin, who were people from Japan, were mentioned in historical documents like the Book of Han and the Geographical Survey of Japan, dating back to around the 2nd century BC. 

In the late 7th century, the Yamato kingdom, which was also known as Yamato, changed its external name to Japan, but its relation to Japan mentioned in the Book of the Later Han is not clear. There are differences in the descriptions found in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang.


Wajinden

The Wajinden is one of the earliest historical accounts of Japan. It refers to passages found in the 30th volume of the Chinese history book Records of the Three Kingdoms. These passages describe the Wa people, who would later be known as the Japanese people, and provide information about their customs, geography, and other aspects of their lives. The Records of the Three Kingdoms was written by Chen Shou during the Western Jin Dynasty at the end of the 3rd century, between the years 280 and 297, which was the year of Chen Shou's death..

Chernobog and Belobog

Chernobog ( "Black God") and Belobog ( "White God") are alleged Polabian deities, with Chernobog meaning "Black God" and Belobog meaning "White God". Chernobog is mentioned in Helmold's Chronicle as a god of misfortune worshipped by the Wagri and Obodrites, while Belobog is not mentioned and is believed to have been reconstructed in opposition to Chernobog. Both gods also appear in later sources, but their authenticity is debated among scholars. Some researchers consider them as authentic deities associated with good and evil, while others believe they may be pseudo-deities. Chernobog and Belobog originally referred to "bad fate" and "good fate" and later became associated with the Christian Devil and God.

Lada (mythology)

Lada and Lado are slavic pseudodeities.
Lada was first mentioned in the sermons of the Christian priest Lucas of Wielki Koźmin around 1405-1412. Lucas warned against worshipping Lada and other gods during spring ceremonies and folk performances. 

However, the majority of religious scholars and Slavists reject the historicity of these deities, believing that they owe their divine status to a misunderstanding of song lyrics by medieval scribes.

Chromosphere

A chromosphere ("sphere of color") is the second layer of a star's atmosphere. It is located above the photosphere and below the solar transition region and corona. The term usually refers to the Sun's chromosphere, but not only.

In the Sun's atmosphere, the chromosphere is about in height, or a little more than 1% of the Sun's radius at maximum thickness. It possesses a homogeneous layer at the border with the photosphere. Hair-like jets of plasma, called spicules, rise from this homogeneous area and through the chromosphere, extending up to into the corona above.

The chromosphere has a usual and expected red color due to electromagnetic emissions in the "H" spectral line. Information about the chromosphere is mostly received by analysis of its given-off electromagnetic radiation. 

Chromospheres have also been followed on stars other than the Sun. On large stars, chromospheres sometimes make up a significant proportion of the whole star. For example, the chromosphere of supergiant star Antares has been found to be about 2.5 times larger in thickness than the star's radius.

Equinox (celestial coordinates)

In astronomy, an equinox is either of two places on the celestial sphere at which the ecliptic divides the celestial equator. Although there are two such intersections, the equinox connected with the Sun's ascending node is used as the ordinary origin of celestial coordinate systems and referred to simply as "the equinox". In contrast to the common usage of spring/vernal and Autumn/autumnal equinoxes, the celestial coordinate system equinox is a direction in space rather than a moment in time.

In a cycle of about 25,800 years, the equinox moves westward with respect to the celestial sphere because of perturbing forces; therefore, in order to define a coordinate system, it is necessary to specify the date for which the equinox is chosen. This date should not be confused with the epoch. Astronomical objects show real movements such as orbital and proper motions, and the epoch defines the date for which the position of an object applies. Therefore, a complete detailed description of the coordinates for an astronomical object needs both the date of the equinox and of the epoch.

The now used standard equinox and epoch is J2000.0, which is January 1, 2000 at 12:00 TT. The prefix "J" shows that it is a Julian epoch. The previous standard equinox and epoch was B1950.0, with the prefix "B" showing that it was a Besselian epoch. Before 1984 Besselian equinoxes and epochs were used. Since that time Julian equinoxes and epochs have been used.

The equinox moves, in the sense that as time goes forward it is in a different location with respect to the distant stars. As a result, star catalogs over the years, even over the course of a few decades, will list different ephemerides. This is due to precession and nutation, both of which can be modeled, as well as other minor perturbing (disturbing) forces which can only be decided by observation and are this way tabulated in astronomical almanacs.

Precession of the equinox was first noted by Hipparchus in 129 BC, when noting the location of Spica with respect to the equinox and comparing it to the location followed by Timocharis in 273 BC. It is a long term movement with a period of 25,800 years.

Nutation is the oscillation of the ecliptic plane. It was first followed by James Bradley as a difference in the declination of stars. Bradley published this discovery in 1748. Because he did not have a correct enough clock, Bradley was unaware of the effect of nutation on the movement of the equinox along the celestial equator, although that is in the present day the more significant aspect of nutation. The period of oscillation of the nutation is 18.6 years.

A Besselian epoch, named after German mathematician and astronomer Friedrich Bessel (1784–1846), is an epoch that is based on a "Besselian year" of 365.242198781 days, which is a tropical year measured at the point where the Sun's longitude is exactly 280°. Since 1984, Besselian equinoxes and epochs have been superseded by Julian equinoxes and epochs. The current standard equinox and epoch is J2000.0, which is a Julian epoch.

Besselian epochs are calculated according to:

The previous standard equinox and epoch were B1950.0, a Besselian epoch.

Since the right ascension and declination of stars are constantly changing due to precession, astronomers always specify these with reference to a particular equinox. Historically used Besselian equinoxes include B1875.0, B1900.0, B1925.0 and B1950.0. The official constellation borders were defined in 1930 using B1875.0.

A Julian epoch is an epoch that is based on Julian years of exactly 365.25 days. Since 1984, Julian epochs are used in preference to the earlier Besselian epochs.

Julian epochs are calculated according to:

The standard equinox and epoch now in use are J2000.0, which is equal to January 1, 2000 12:00 Terrestrial Time (TT).

The J2000.0 epoch is exactly Julian date 2451545.0 TT (Terrestrial Time), or January 1, 2000, noon TT. This is equal to January 1, 2000, 11:59:27.816 TAI or January 1, 2000, 11:58:55.816 UTC.

Since the right ascension and declination of stars are constantly changing due to precession, (and, for relatively nearby stars due to proper motion), astronomers always specify these with reference to a particular epoch. The earlier epoch that was in standard use was the B1950.0 epoch.

When the "mean" equator and equinox of J2000 are used to define a celestial reference frame, that frame may also be represented J2000 coordinates or simply J2000. This is different from the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS): the mean equator and equinox at J2000.0 are seperate from and of lower (high) quality than ICRS, but agree with ICRS to the limited (high) quality of the first thing mentioned. Use of the "mean" locations means that nutation is averaged out or left out. This means that the Earth's rotational North pole does not point quite at the J2000 celestial pole at the epoch J2000.0; the true pole of epoch nutates away from the mean one. The same differences relate to the equinox.

The "J" in the prefix shows that it is a Julian equinox or epoch rather than a Besselian equinox or epoch.

There is a special meaning of the expression "equinox (and ecliptic/equator) of date". This reference frame is defined by the positions of the ecliptic and the celestial equator as of the date/epoch on which the position of something else (usually a solar system object) is being specified.

Other equinoxes and epochs that have been used include:

Epochs and equinoxes for orbital elements are usually given in Terrestrial Time, in many different formats, including:

Sidereal time is the hour angle of the equinox. However, there are two types: if the mean equinox is used (that which only includes precession), it is called mean sidereal time; if the true equinox is used (the actual location of the equinox at a given instant), it is called apparent sidereal time. The difference between these two is known as the equation of the equinoxes, and is counted in the "Astronomical Almanac".

A related idea is known as the equation of the origins, which is the arc length between the Celestial Intermediate Origin and the equinox. Or, the equation of the origins is the difference between the Earth Rotation Angle and the apparent sidereal time at Greenwich.

In modern astronomy the ecliptic and the equinox are reducing in importance as needed, or even convenient, reference ideas. (The equinox remains important in ordinary civil use, in defining the seasons, however.) This is for many reasons. One important reason is that it is very hard to be exact what the ecliptic is, and there is even some confusion in the books about it. Should it be centered on the Earth's center of mass, or on the Earth-Moon barycenter?

Also with the introduction of the International Celestial Reference Frame, all objects near and far are put basically in relationship to a large frame based on very distant fixed radio sources, and the choice of the origin is random and defined for the convenience of the problem at hand. There are no significant problems in astronomy where the ecliptic and the equinox need to be defined.

Forth and Clyde Canal

The Forth and Clyde Canal opened in 1790. It is is 35 miles (56 km) long. It provided a route for boats to go between Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth to Glasgow on the Firth of Clyde at the narrowest part of the Scottish Lowlands. As the boats grew bigger and the railways were developed it was slowly abandoned. In 1967 the part through Grangemouth was drained and filled in. 

In 2000 the Falkirk Wheel was built to connect it again to the Union Canal.

Falkirk Wheel

The Falkirk Wheel is a rotating boat lift in Tamfourhill, Falkirk, in central Scotland. It connects the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal. It opened in 2002 as part of the Millennium Link project. It is the only rotating boat lift of its kind in the world, and one of two working boat lifts in the United Kingdom, the other being the Anderton Boat Lift.

The two canals used to be connected by a series of 11 locks but they were closed in 1933. The Union canal is 35-metre (115 ft) above the Forth and Clyde Canal.

Much of the money came from the Millennium Commission. The wheel was built in Ripley, Derbyshire by Butterley Engineering and carried to Falkirk on 35 lorries. There are also a 160 m (520 ft) new canal tunnel of 8 m (26 ft) diameter, 2 aqueducts of 20 m (66 ft) and 120 m (390 ft), three sets of locks and a number of bridges.

Canal de Marseille au Rhône

The Canal de Marseille au Rhône connects the Mediterranean Sea at Marseille to the Rhône at Arles. It is 81 kilometres (50 miles) long. The section between Marignane and Marseille has been closed since the collapse of the Rove Tunnel in 1963. 

It was built between 1906 and 1927. The Rove tunnel is the longest canal tunnel in the world - 7,120 metres (23,360 ft). 

TRAPPIST-1e

TRAPPIST-1e, also known as 2MASS J23062928-0502285 e, is a rocky, almost earth-size exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone around the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 about away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. Astronomers found the exoplanet by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured.

The exoplanet was one of seven new exoplanets discovered orbiting the star using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Three of the seven ("e", "f", and "g") are in the habitable zone. TRAPPIST-1e is almost the same to Earth's mass, radius, density, gravity, temperature, and stellar flux. It is also confirmed to not have a cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, meaning it is more likely to have a compact atmosphere like the terrestrial planets in the Solar System. 

In November 2018, researchers decided that of the seven exoplanets in the multi-planetary system, TRAPPIST-1e has the best chance of being an Earth-like ocean planet, and the one most worthy of further study related to habitability. What's more, according to the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog, TRAPPIST-1e is one of the most possible habitable exoplanets discovered.

Gosha Suwa Shrine

Gosha-Suwa-jinja, is a Shinto shrine located in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. It is in Naka Ward, which is in the central part of Hamamatsu City. It is located about 6.5 kilometers away from the right bank of the Tenryū River, in a straight line. The shrine is also near the railway station, approximately 1 kilometer away, and the city's castle, which is about 500 meters to the north.

The Gosha-Suwa religious complex consists of typical architectural elements commonly found in Shintō shrines, including an entrance gate called torii, a building for worship called haiden which is guarded by a traditional pair of creatures, a main building known as honden, an ablution pavilion called temizuya, a temple office referred to as shamusho, and supports for hanging votive plaques. The main axis of the shrine's enclosure is an alley that runs from the entrance torii to the haiden, oriented east-west parallel to the Enshū Sea and perpendicular to the ancient Tōkai road that leads north to the castle entrance in Hamamatsu. The shrine is distinguished by the presence of two hokora, one dedicated to ancestor worship and the other honoring Inari. Additionally, there is a shed used for storing mikoshi, which are portable shrines used during religious processions.

Gosha-Suwa Shrine is affiliated with Kasuga-taisha in Nara City, Nara Prefecture, and Suwa Grand Shrine near Lake Suwa, Nagano Prefecture. It venerates Shinto deities such as Takemikazuchi, the "thunder god", Ama-no-Koyane-no-mikoto, Futsunushi, Suwa Myojin, and Kotoshironushi, who are considered as the sons of Ōkuninushi. Devotees visit the shrine to convey their wishes for various blessings, such as prosperity, happiness, finding a soul mate, successful fishing, abundant harvests, or safe childbirth.

In the early 16th century, the leader of the Imagawa clan built a castle called Hikuma Castle in the province of Tōtōmi, which also had a shrine within its enclosure. Later in the same century, Tokugawa Ieyasu, who would become the ruler of unified Japan, seized the castle, expanded it, and renamed it Hamamatsu Castle. In 1579, after the birth of his son Tokugawa Hidetada, he converted the shrine into a place of worship for the Shintō deity Futsunushi. The following year, he had the holy place rebuilt outside the castle's enclosure.

In 1914, the Gosha sanctuary was classified as a national treasure. However, on June 18, 1945, an air raid by the American army destroyed all the buildings.

In 761, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, a general in the service of Emperor Kammu, had a Shintō shrine built in Tōtōmi province. This shrine was later moved in 1556 to the foot of Hikuma Castle, and then in the 1580s it came under the control of the Tokugawa dynasty. In 1641, the sanctuary was rebuilt stone by stone near the Gosha-jinja.

In 1938, the Suwa sanctuary was classified as a national treasure. However, on June 18, 1945, during an aerial bombardment, several buildings of the religious complex were reduced to ashes.

In 1962, in the city of Hamamatsu, two Shintō shrines, Gosha-jinja and Suwa-jinja, merged to form the religious complex Gosha-Suwa. The construction of Gosha-Suwa was completed in 1982, including the opening of its honden (main hall) to the faithful. During World War II, the shrines of Gosha-jinja and Suwa-jinja were heavily damaged by bombings, resulting in the loss of their national treasure status. Unfortunately, the damage could not be repaired.

On November 15th, during the traditional annual festival called shichi-go-san, parents come to Gosha-Suwa Shrine as a family to pray for the good health of their children. The shrine's enclosure is crowded with families who participate in this festival.

St Luke Passion, BWV 246

The St Luke Passion (), BWV 246, is a musical composition. Its author is not known. It was thought that Johann Sebastian Bach wrote the passion. However, the style of the composition is different from Bach's style.

The manuscript of the "St Luke Passion" was written by Johann Sebastian Bach and his son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. Franz Hauser bought the manuscript in the early 19th century. He thought that Johann Sebastian Bach was the author of the composition. He asked Felix Mendelssohn for his opinion. Mendelssohn thought that Bach was not the author of the composition. He pointed out that a chorale did not fit Bach's style.

It was thought that Bach copied the Passion setting to be performed in Leipzig in 1730. However, this has been proven to be false.

IRC −10414

IRC-10414 is a Red hyper giant star and is one of the largest stars known. It is not well known because IRC’s and IRAS’s are not very popular. If you placed it in the Solar system, It would engulf the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and dwarf planet Ceres. However, IRC 10414 is a bit tiny compared to larger stars such as WOH G64, VY Canis Majoris and UY Scuti. It is still a big honking star. It is approximately 1,000 times bigger than our own Star, The Sun. It is not likely that it has planets, But another large star, VV Cephei, has a smaller companion, so there is a small chance IRC-10414 has a smaller companion. However, scientists have not found a single binary orbiting this huge star. If you want to learn about more large Stars, check out the List of Largest Stars page.

HD 8673 is a binary star system in the constellation of Andromeda. It has an apparent magnitude of 6.34 and absolute magnitude of 3.56. It is 124.5 light years away from us. They are moving away from us with a heliocentric radial velocity (speed) of 19 km/s. A smaller object, possibly a exoplanet or brown dwarf, was found orbiting around them in 2005.

The main (primary) star is classified as an F7 V star. It is almost the same to the Sun but a bit bigger, with a mass of 1.36 times the mass of the Sun and 1.52 times the Sun's size. The star is about 1.5 billion years old and is spinning quickly, with a projected radial velocity of 26.9 km/s. It is emitting off 3.4 times more light than the Sun and has an effective temperature of 6,340 K.

In 2011, speckle interferometry measurements suggested that there might be another star close to this one. But more observations showed that it was wrong. Later, a smaller star was found orbiting the main (primary) star. This star is about one-third to half the size of the Sun and is far away from the main star, about 35 to 60 times farther than the Earth is from the Sun.

Jamestown Settlement

On 14 May 1607, just over one hundred men settled in what is now Jamestown, Virginia to become the first permanent English colony in the New World. In 1619 the first women and slaves
arrived, and the colonists elected some of their number to the House of Burgesses, the first representative legislature in the Americas. The colony was chartered on 10 April 1606, one year back. 

To mark the 350th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown Settlement, in 1957 a large festival park opened with much ballyhoo: Queen Elizabeth II of England made an official appearance and loaned a copy of the Magna Carta for the exhibition. There is now a working reconstruction of the settlement -- and of the three ships that brought the colonists: the "Godspeed", the "Discovery", and the "Susan Constant" (or "Sarah Constant") -- that is very popular with tourists, especially school groups. Recent archeological work at the site is still expanding our knowledge of what happened at Jamestown in its earliest days.

A1 Telekom Austria Group

A1 Telekom Austria Group is a provider of a range of fixed-line, broadband Internet, multimedia services, data, and IT systems, wholesale as well as mobile payment services. It is a subsidiary of Mexican telecommunications conglomerate América Móvil since 2014, and its headquarters are in Vienna. The company operates subsidiaries in seven European countries: Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia. Its largest subsidiary is the Austrian telecommunications provider A1 Telekom Austria.

Telekom Austria's earliest predecessor, the state-owned PTT agency K.K Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung (PTV), was formed in 1887 when all telephone and mail services in Austria-Hungary were taken over by the state. After World War I, the Austrian portion of the company became simply Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung.

In 1996, with the passage of the Post Restructuring Act, PTV was restructured as a public corporation, Post-und Telekom Austria AG (PTA AG). Only two years later, the telecommunications sector was fully deregulated and PTA was split, with the telecom side becoming Telekom Austria. The company was fully privatised in 2000 and was listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange (it delisted from the latter in 2007).

In June 2000, the company invested about 15 million euros to rebrand itself as Jet2Web. However, Jet2Web failed to succeed in the market, because it was perceived as unreliable. The use of the name was discontinued in 2002, and the company name Telekom Austria was revived as the brand name with a new logo.

In June 2006, the company was split into the holding company Telekom Austria Group, with the public switched telephone network becoming Telekom Austria FixNet AG, which was later renamed Telekom Austria TA AG. In doing so, Telekom Austria FixNet AG became a sister company of affiliate Mobilkom Austria AG.

Both merged in 2010 to form A1 Telekom Austria. Foreign subsidiaries of Mobilkom Austria were transferred to the holding company, so that A1 Telekom Austria would only deal with the Austrian market.

In 2011, misdemeanours by company directors between 2004 and 2006 became public, erupting into a scandal known as the Telekom-Affäre.

As of the end of 2016, Telekom Austria Group had 18,203 employees and generated about €4.2 billion in revenues.

In 2020, all shares of Telecom Liechtenstein were sold to the Principality.

On 23 April 2014 Carlos Slim, owner of America Movil, took control of Telekom Austria by forming a syndicate agreement between ÖIAG and America Movil, spending as much as $2 billion to buy out minority shareholders and investing up to 1 billion euros ($1.38 billion) into the company. America Movil sees Telekom Austria as a "platform for expansion into Central and Eastern Europe". Labour representatives boycotted the decision on the syndicate agreement at the ÖIAG supervisory board meeting for 12 hours criticising lack of explicit job guarantees.

A1 Telekom Austria Group operates the following subsidiaries:

A1 Telekom reduced mobile Internet bandwidth in Minsk during 2020 Belarusian protests at the request of Belarusian officials.

Galactic year

The galactic year, also known as a cosmic year, is the length of time needed for the Sun to orbit once around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. One galactic year is 230 million Earth years. The Solar System is traveling at an average speed of 230 km/s (828,000 km/h) within its arc-like path around the galactic center, a speed at which an object could travel around the Earth's equator in 2 minutes and 54 seconds; that speed goes along with about 1/1300 of the speed of light.

The galactic year provides a conveniently usable unit for showing cosmic and geological time periods together. Very differently, a "billion-year" scale does not allow for useful difference between geologic events, and a "million-year" scale needs some rather large numbers.

Turkic mythology

Turkic mythology reflects the wide variety of different religions that the Turkic peoples professed throughout their history. It is mainly influenced by Tengrism, the old Turkish faith. Heroic rulers always play an important role, the sacred wolf, the levels of the underworld and the upper world in which various overpowering beings exist, giants, monsters, and the sacred numbers 3, 7, 9 and 40.

The legend of the she-wolf Asena is the oldest known legend of Turkish mythology (oldest version 330 BC). It is the tragic story of the Tue'kue, who are wiped out except for one badly injured little boy by an enemy attack. The boy survives in a bog with severed hands and feet. The she-wolf Asena finds the boy, nurses him and thus ensures the continued existence of the colony. The wolf, as the holiest and highest totem animal of the Turks, plays an important role in many sagas and myths. The Turks regarded the wolf as their ancestor. The wolf is the animal that seems to play the most important role in ancient Turkic mythology. It is likely that the original legend of the ancestral wolf developed among the Hsiung-nu (or Huns) at an unknown but undoubtedly very early date. Shiratori writes that in pre-Christian times it appears already well developed among the Wu sun of the Išíq Qul and the Ili, who are Indo-Europeans or Proto-Turks. Two stories introduce us to her. Both told of a she-wolf nursing a foundling and a raven circling overhead.

Kaira Khan understands that he must create land. He commands man to dive into the water and fetch sand from the bottom. Man is insidious and ungrateful, he suspects the intention of the god and hides a little bit for himself when fetching the sand in his mouth (or in his beak) in order to create his own country. He follows the god's renewed command and scatters the sand on the water. Suddenly, islands appear that grow rapidly and become land. But the sand in people's mouths is also beginning to increase. His cheeks are getting bigger and he is in danger of suffocating and dying. Kaira Khan orders him to spit out the sand so he doesn't die. From what is spat out arise (ugly, superfluous) mountains on the beautiful land that before was only wide, flat steppe. Kaira Khan speaks: You sinned and wanted to cheat me. The minds of the peoples who worship me will be pure and they will enjoy the sunlight. Your name shall be Erlik. The people who commit sin shall become your people. Kaira Khan grows a huge tree on a hill with nine branches. Törüngey and Eje, the ancestors of all people, sit under this tree.

The 11th-century Dede-Korkut book contains twelve sagas of the Oghuz. Among them are tribal myths, heroic sagas and heartbreaking love stories.

Sculptor Group

The Sculptor Group is a loose group of galaxies. It is visible near the south galactic pole. The group is one of the nearest groups of galaxies to the Local Group; the distance to the center of the Sculptor Group from the Milky Way is about 12.7 million light years.

The Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253) and a few other galaxies form a gravitationally-bound core in the center of this group. A few other galaxies at the edges may be connected with the group but may not be gravitationally bound. Because most of the galaxies in this group are actually weakly gravitationally bound, the group may also be described as a filament. It is believed to be at an early stage of evolution in which galaxies are still falling into the group along filamentary structures.

Astrakhan Tatars

The Astrakhan Tatars (Tatar: Əsterxan tatarları, Әsterhan tatarlary) are a Muslim Tatars population of about 80,000 people in the Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

They are descended from the nomadic Kypchaks, Volga Bulgarians and Khazars]]. After the breakup of the Golden Horde, they founded the Khanate of Astrakhan (1459-1556) on the Lower Volga. The related Nogai also lived here, by whom they were strongly influenced. The Volga Bulgarians also had trading settlements in the area, and the so-called Agryzjan Tatars, were the Muslim descendants of 51 Indian Hindu traders from India, who settled in Astrakhan in 1649 and married local Muslim Astrakhan Tatar women. 
The families lived in the Agryzjan suburb in Astrakhan and the descendants were named after this suburb. 

Since the 17th century there was an increasing influence of the also Muslim Volga Tatars, who lived in the middle course of the river.

During the Soviet period, the Astrakhan Tatars were counted among the Volga Tatars. In the 2010 census, most simply listed themselves as "Tatars". A large number of Volga Tatars also live in the oblast, and the differences between them are gradually disappearing.

Astrakhan Tatar is a mixed dialect. Around 43,000 speakers have assimilated to the much more widely spoken Kazan Tatar language.


Icosidodecahedron

An icosidodecahedron is a polyhedron (a three-dimensional shape) with 20 ("icosi") triangular faces and 12 ("dodeca") pentagonal faces. An icosidodecahedron has 30 identical vertices, with two triangles and two pentagons meeting at each, and 60 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a pentagon. As such it is one of the Archimedean solids and more especially, a quasiregular polyhedron.

Earth radius

Earth radius (represented as "R" or formula_1) is the distance from the center of Earth to a point on or near its surface. Approximating the figure of Earth by an Earth spheroid, the radius ranges from a maximum of nearly (equatorial radius, represented "a") to a minimum of nearly (polar radius, represented "b"). 

Earth radius is sometimes used as a unit of measurement in astronomy and geophysics. The International Astronomical Union recommends that the radius at the equator should be used.

A globally-average value is usually believed to be with a 0.3% variability (±10 km) for the following reasons. The International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) provides three reference values: the "mean radius" (R) of three radii measured at two equator points and a pole; the "authalic radius", which is the radius of a sphere with the same surface area (R); and the "volumetric radius", which is the radius of a sphere having the same volume as the ellipsoid (R). All three values are about .

Other ways to define and measure the Earth radius involve the radius of curvature. A few definitions yield values outside the range between polar radius and equatorial radius because they include local or geoidal topography or because they depend on abstract geometrical that are carefully thought about.

Granula

Granula was the first commercial breakfast cereal, invented by James Caleb in 1863. It is mostly made of bran-rich graham flour, which was formed into nugget shapes and baked until it was crispy. Granula was marketed as healthy and was intended to be eaten with milk or cream.

James Caleb, a Seventh-day Adventist, was the proprietor of the Jackson Sanatorium in Dansville, New York, which in hydrotherapy and vegetarianism. He created Granula as a healthy food for his patients, who had to follow a vegetarian diet. Jackson believed that a diet of whole grains and vegetables was the key to good health and longevity.

In 1863, Jackson created Granula by baking graham flour into nuggets, which were then broken into smaller pieces. The cereal was really hard and required soaking in milk or cream before it could be eaten. Jackson marketed Granula as a healthy food, claiming that it was nutritious and easily digestible.

Granula was popular and was sold through mail order catalogs and health food stores, but it was not popular for a long time because of its hard texture and the fact that it required soaking before it could be eaten. In 1877, a similar cereal called Grape-Nuts was introduced, which was made from wheat and barley flour and had a less hard texture. Grape-Nuts quickly became more popular than Granula and eventually replaced it as the msot popular breakfast cereal in the United States.

Although Granula was not successful, it led to the development of the modern breakfast cereal industry. It inspired other inventors to create new and more palatable cereal products, such as Kellogg's Corn Flakes and Quaker Oats.

Today, the term "granola" is used to describe a range of breakfast cereals that are typically made from rolled oats, nuts, and dried fruit. These cereals are often sweetened with honey or sugar and are popular with health-conscious consumers.

IOS jailbreaking

iOS jailbreaking refers to the process of removing the software restrictions imposed by Apple on its iOS operating system. This allows users to gain root access to their iOS devices, modify the device's software and install apps from sources outside of the Apple App Store. Jailbreaking has a rich history, with its origins dating back to the early days of the iPhone.

Jailbreaking first became popular in 2007 with the release of the original iPhone. The first jailbreaking tool was developed by a group of hackers known as the iPhone Dev Team. The tool allowed users to modify their iPhones, install third-party applications, and customize the appearance of the user interface.

Over the years, jailbreaking became more mainstream, and a thriving community of developers and enthusiasts emerged. Many of the early jailbreaking tools were based on exploits found in iOS, which allowed users to bypass Apple's security measures.

In 2010, the US government made it legal to jailbreak an iPhone, citing that jailbreaking did not violate copyright laws. This ruling helped to further legitimize jailbreaking and brought it into the mainstream.

Today, jailbreaking is still popular among iOS users, although it has become less common than in previous years. This is partly due to the increased security measures implemented by Apple in recent versions of iOS.

Jailbreaking can also have negative consequences, such as voiding the device's warranty, and potentially leaving the device vulnerable to security threats.

There are still many jailbreaking tools and communities available for those interested in modifying their iOS devices. These communities continue to develop new tweaks, apps, and tools to enhance the functionality and customization of iOS devices.

IRAS 05280-6910

IRAS 05280–6910 (also known as LMC 582) is a red supergiant star or OH/IR supergiant star. It is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud and it is also the most reddened object in the Large Magellanic Cloud, far more than the redness that the famous red supergiant WOH G64 emits. Its radius is 1,367 to 1,736 times that of the Sun, making it one of the largest stars found so far. If it was placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would reach and eat the orbit of Jupiter. It is estimated that the star loses (Solar mass) per year, this mass loss rate is the highest known for any red supergiant star.

R1a1

Haplogroup R1a1 (Y DNA) In genetics, the Haplogroup R1a1 (M17) is a Y chromosome haplogroup, which is distributed across Greater Asia or (Eurasia). This group is common in Europe, North Central Asia and India. In Europe, the highest concentrations are in Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland and Ukraine, where half of all males belong to this haplogroup. High concentrations are also present in Northern Europe and it is believed that the Vikings spread it throughout the rest of Europe, including the British Isles. The first carriers of the R1a1 haplotype may have been the Proto-Indo-European nomads in Ukraine about 5,000 years ago. In the context of the kurgan hypothesis, it is associated with the spread of the Indo-European languages. In India, the highest concentrations of R1a can be found in the Brahmins. The studies point to an Aryan migration dating back to before 1500 B.C. The average frequency across all castes of the R1a haplogroup is approximately 40%. In Europe a high concentration of this Lineage be found in Roma people https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/r1a1a-conquers-the-worldin-a-few-pulses

WASP-17

WASP-17 is a main sequence star about 1,300 light years away in the constellation Scorpius. It has the spectral type F6V. 

WASP-17 is also known as Dìwö. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Costa Rica. At that time, it was the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Dìwö in Bribri language means the sun.

The star has about the same amount of heavy elements as the Sun. However, it has less carbon than the Sun. The carbon-to-oxygen molar ratio of 0.18 for WASP-17 is far below the solar ratio of 0.55.

An extrasolar planet known as WASP-17b was confirmed orbiting the star as of 2009. The star is unusual for the reason that WASP-17b is believed to orbit in the opposite direction to the direction the star spins and is said to be twice the size of Jupiter, but half its mass. It is subject to deep photo-evaporation, and may be completely destroyed within 1 billion years from now.

WASP-17b was discovered by SuperWASP project. For this reason, the name of the planet and the star has WASP in them.

James Dunlop

James Dunlop FRSE (31 October 1793 – 22 September 1848) was a Scottish astronomer, noted for his work in Australia. He was employed by Sir Thomas Brisbane to work as astronomer's helper at his private observatory, once located at Paramatta (now named Parramatta), New South Wales, about west of Sydney during the 1820s and 1830s. Dunlop was mostly a visual observer, doing stellar astrometry work for Brisbane, and after its completion, then independently discovered and catalogued many new telescopic southern double stars and deep-sky objects. He later became the Top-level manager of Paramatta Observatory when it was finally sold to the New South Wales Government.
James Dunlop was born in Dalry, Ayrshire, Scotland, the son of John Dunlop, a weaver, and his wife Janet, "née" Boyle. Dunlop was educated at a primary school in Dalry and went to work at a thread factory in Beith when he was 14. He also attended a night-school in Beith kept by a man named Gardiner. He became interested in astronomy at an early age and was building telescopes in 1810. By fortune in 1820, he got to know the astronomically inclined Sir Thomas Brisbane. In the same year, Brisbane was selected as the new Governor of New South Wales, who then decided to set up an astronomical observatory in the new Colony. Before leaving Britain, Dunlop was then selected as his second scientific helper, and both travelled to Sydney in 1821.

Ebony (tree)

Ebony is a dense darker than brown hardwood, coming from some species in the genus "Diospyros", which has persimmons as well. Not like most trees, ebony is dense enough to slowly fall in water. It is softly textured and has a mirror finish when polished, making it great as an ornamental wood. The word "ebony" comes from the Ancient Egyptian ', through the Ancient Greek ('), as well as Latin and Middle English.

The ebony tree has many species (types), having "Diospyros ebenum" (Ceylon ebony), that lives in southern India and Sri Lanka; "D. crassiflora" (Gabon ebony), usually in western Africa; "D. humilis" (Queensland ebony), native to Queensland, the Northern Territory, New Guinea and Timor; and "D. celebica" (Sulawesi ebony), native to Indonesia and prized for its nice, multi-colored wood grain. Mauritius ebony, "D. tessellaria", was largely overused by the Dutch in the 17th century. Some species in the genus have an ebony with similar looks, but striped rather than the even black of "D. ebenum".

Ebony has been used for a very long time, and carved pieces have been found in Ancient Egyptian tombs.

By the end of the 16th century, fine cabinets for the luxury trade were made of ebony in Antwerp. The wood's dense hardness helped people create refined moldings framing finely detailed pictorial panels with carving in very low relief (bas-relief), usually of allegorical subjects, or with scenes taken from classical or Christian history. Within a short time, such cabinets were also being made in Paris, where their makers became known as "ébénistes", which remains the French term for a cabinetmaker.

Modern uses are largely restricted to small items, such as crucifixes, the main body of some musical instruments such as the clarinet, oboe, or piccolo and musical instrument parts, including black piano, organ, and harpsichord keys; violin, viola, mandolin, guitar, double bass, and cello fingerboards; tailpieces; tuning pegs; chinrests; and bow frogs. Many plectrums, or guitar picks, are made from ebony.

Traditionally, black chess pieces were made from ebony, with boxwood or ivory being used for the white pieces. Modern East Midlands-style lace-making bobbins, also being small, are often made of ebony and look particularly decorative when bound with brass or silver wire. Some expensive handgun grips and rifle fore-end tips are still made of ebony, as are the butts of pool cues.

As a result of unsustainable harvesting, many species yielding ebony are now considered threatened. Most indigenous ebony in Africa in particular has been cut down illegally.

In Sri Lanka, ebony is a protected species and harvesting and sale of ebony is illegal and punishable by imprisonment.

In 2011, the Gibson Guitar company was raided by the US Fish and Wildlife Service for violations of the Lacey Act of 1900, which prohibits the illegal importation of threatened woods and other materials.

An ebony and rosewood expert at the Missouri Botanical Garden calls the Madagascar wood trade the "equivalent of Africa's blood diamonds".
