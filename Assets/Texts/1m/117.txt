Indooroopilly Silver Mine

The Indooroopilly Silver Mine is a historic silver mine at Indooroopilly, Brisbane, Australia
In 1918, G. Olsen and his neighbour, Patrick J. Madden discovered silver-lead traces on Mr Olsen’s land at Finney’s Hill, Indooroopilly, a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland, 10km from the city centre. After some promising excavations all over the property approximately 200 feet above sea level, a mineral lease was granted to them and the first ore recovered from the site was dispatched to Cockle Creek, N.S.W. for smelting.

The success of this led to the construction of an underground shaft to commence open-cut mining of the site in 1919. A number of leases were taken out on the property and adjacent land. A year later geophysical prospecting was undertaken, the first record of such a survey being undertaken in Queensland.

In 1921, a larger shaft was sunk to recover ore and a small treatment plant was erected in 1924 to facilitate work there. Mining continued with P.J. Madden purchasing the property outright. The existing house on the land, Fernbrook, built by architect, George Addison was demolished.

By 1929, the mine ceased operations, due to poor metal prices worldwide and the exhaustion of the higher grade reserve. Total production for the period 1919-1929 had been 227, 343 oz of silver and 1,795 tonnes of lead.
Over the next two decades, the mine remained closed. Shafts and tunnels collapsed as timber rotted, and the land was susceptible to flooding from the Brisbane River. The University of Queensland leased the site in 1951, totalling 6 hectares for its Department of Mining. The property was owned by Brisbane City Council, who sold it to the Queensland government. In 1956, the state government provided to mine site to the University granting it permanent and exclusive surface and underground rights. 

The open-cut and underground workings resumed, offering the University an opportunity to manage it as a working mine and teaching facility. Three shafts exist – the main shaft sunk to a depth of 290 ft, a ventilation shaft sunk to 150 ft and an inclined shaft sunk 65 degrees horizontal to the mine’s 140 ft level. This was established by students of the Colombo Plan to gain experience.

The mine operates today as part of the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre.

Explanatory variable

Kamehameha I

Kamehameha I (about 1736–1819) was the first king of Hawaii. 
Kamehameha was born about 1736, probably during the winter. His parents were Keoua and Keku‘iapoiwa II. They were cousins. Their grandfather was Keawe‘ikekahiali‘iokamoku, who had been the boss ("ali‘i nui") of the big island of Hawaii. When Keawe‘ikekahiali‘iokamoku died, there was a civil war. Keoua and his brother Kalani‘opu‘u lost, and Alapa‘inui won. Keoua lived with Alapa‘inui for a while, but he died when Kamehameha was still a little boy. Kamehameha left and lived with his uncle Kalani‘opu‘u. 

When Kamehameha's uncle died in 1782, his cousin Kiwala‘o became the new boss of the big island of Hawaii. Kamehameha became the head priest for the Hawaiian god of war Kuka‘ilimoku and the leader of the Waipi‘o Valley. He and his cousin started to fight because Kamehameha showed more respect to the gods than to his cousin. Some leaders in Kona joined him. They beat Kiwala‘o at the Battle of Moku‘ohai, and Kamehameha became the leader of Kona, Kohala, and Hamakua on Hawaii Island.

At that time, there were people who said that they could see the future. They told a prophecy that Kamehameha would bring Hawaii together and even unite the people of Polynesia as far away as the Maoris in New Zealand. Kamehameha began to plan to unite all the kingdoms of the different islands. He started buying guns and bullets from British and American sailors who came to Hawaii while they hunted whales. Captain Brown began to bring him gunpowder from China and taught him how to it from sulfur, saltpeter, and charcoal on Hawaii. Isaac Davis and John Young stayed on Hawaii, married Hawaiian women, and taught Kamehameha's men how to use and fix guns.

Kamehameha took Puna from its leader Keawema‘uhili in 1790. Keoua Ku‘ahu‘ula tried to take over his land while he was busy fighting, but Kamehameha was able to come back with his men in time. Keoua Ku‘ahu‘ula ran away past the volcano Kilauea and lost many men because of poison gas. The next year, Kamehameha invited him to visit. When Keoua Ku‘ahu‘ula came, he and his protectors were all killed. Kamehameha was now the boss of the big island of Hawaii.

Kamehameha now had 960 war canoes and about 10,000 men. He took Maui and Molokai at the Battle of Kawela in 1795. 

Kamehameha then attacked Oahu, landing his men at Wai‘alae and Waikiki. His helper Ka‘iana was really helping his enemy Kalanikupule. He helped make special safe places for Kalanikupule's cannon on top of the Pali Mountains. This caused Kamehameha to lose many men until he sent many to climb the other side of the mountains and hit the cannon from behind. 400 Oahu men were forced over the side of the mountains' cliff. Ka‘iana was killed in the battle, and Kalanikupule was caught and given as a gift to the war god Kuka‘ilimoku.

Kamehameha got Kaumuali‘i, the leader of Kauai, to work for him in April 1810 and, in this way, at last became the only leader of all the Hawaiian Islands. Other angry leaders wanted to kill Kaumuali‘i with poison at a big dinner but Isaac Davis heard about their plan and told him ahead of time.

Kamehameha made Kamakahonu in Kona his home after about 1812. He wanted the Hawaiian Islands to stay together after he died. He made all the islands use the same laws. He used his taxes to increase the islands' trade with Europe and the United States. He thought about bringing in Christianity to the islands, but decided that the Hawaiian gods that he had followed so far were strong in spirit and had brought him his success. He had somewhere between 20 and 30 wives and about 35 children, including 17 sons and 18 daughters. 

Kamehameha died on May 8 or 14, 1819. No one is sure where his body was put, because the Hawaiians thought people could use the spiritual power of the dead and the king's close friends Hoapili and Ho‘olulu hid his body carefully. His children by his wife Keopuolani followed him as the leaders of Hawaii and are known as the House of Kamehameha.

Roman calendar

The Roman calendar was a lunar calendar used by the Roman Kingdom and the Roman Republic.

The year started on 1 March and had only 304 days or 10 months (March, April, May, June, Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October, November and December). These 304 days were followed by an unnamed 50-day winter period. The Roman king Numa Pompilius (c. 715-673 BC) introduced February and January (in that order) between December and March, increasing the length of the year to 354 or 355 days. In 450 BC, February was moved to its current position between January and March.

In order to make up for the lack of days in a year, an extra month, Intercalaris or Mercedonius, (allegedly with 22 or 23 days) was introduced in some years. In an 8 year period the length of the years were:


A total of 2930 days corresponding to a year of 366¼ days. This year was discovered to be too long, and therefore 7 days were later dropped from the 8th year, yielding 365.375 days per year.

It was the duty of the priesthood not to have any mistake of the intercalary month. However, leap years were considered unlucky. Therefore, they were avoided in time of crisis, such as the Second Punic War. In order to fix the problem, Julius Caesar made his famous calendar reform in 45 BC.

Norman E. Hallendy is an Arctic researcher, writer and photographer. Hallendy's Arctic journeys began in 1958 at a time when many Inuit, who traditionally lived on the land, were moving to permanent settlements created by the Federal government. Returning north year after year, he was befriended by Inuit elders who shared with him their perception of their material and spiritual world.

His previous books include the best selling Inuksuit: 


He has been a lecturer at Oxford, Cambridge, UNESCO (Paris) including numerous universities in Canada and abroad. His most enjoyable presentations were to Inuit elders and their children in several Arctic communities. 

Norman Hallendy has been named one of Canada’s 100 greatest modern-day explorers by Canadian Geographic Society. 

His contribution to geographical knowledge through documenting Arctic landscapes and ancient sites earned him the coveted Mungo Park Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 2007 placing him among such esteemed persons as Professor Jean Malaurie, Count Eigil Knuth and Thor Heyerdahl. 

In 2001, the Royal Canadian Geographical Society awarded Hallendy the Gold medal for his internationally acclaimed work on inuksuit and ethnographic work in southwest Baffin Island placing him among such outstanding contributors to geography as Michael Palin, Gilbert Grosvenor and Sir Christopher Ondaatje.

The War of the Worlds (radio drama)

In 1938, Orson Welles produced a radio version of the 1898 book "The War of the Worlds" by H. G. Wells. Wells only produced one episode of the American radio drama anthology series "The Mercury Theatre on the Air". This episode was produced as the Halloween episode. It was broadcast on Sunday, October 30, 1938. It became famous for allegedly causing mass panic, although the scale of the panic is disputed as the program had relatively few listeners.

The first two-thirds of the one-hour broadcast was presented as a series of simulated news bulletins. The first news update interrupted a program of dance music to report that a series of odd explosions had been spotted on Mars, which was followed soon thereafter by a seemingly unrelated report of an unusual object falling on a farm in Grover's Mill, New Jersey. Martians emerged from the object and attacked using a heat ray during the next interruption, which was followed by a rapid series of news reports describing a devastating alien invasion taking place across the United States and the world. The illusion of realism was increased because the "Mercury Theatre on the Air" was a sustaining show without commercial interruptions, and the first break in the program came almost 30 minutes into the broadcast. Popular legend holds that all of the radio audience may have been listening to Edgar Bergen and tuned in to "The War of the Worlds" during a musical interlude, thereby missing the clear introduction that the show was a drama, but research beginning in the 2010s suggests this only happened in rare instances.In the days following the adaptation, widespread outrage was expressed in the media. The program's news-bulletin format was described as deceptive by some newspapers and public figures, leading to an outcry against the perpetrators of the broadcast and calls for regulation by the Federal Communications Commission. The episode secured Welles' fame as a dramatist.

Sindhi writers

Sindhi language is spoken by more than 50 million people and Sindhi literature is as rich as of any language known to human society. Shah Abdul latif Bhittai, Sachal Sarmast and Sammi are considered as the legendary trio of Sindhi literature. Here in this discussion we concentrate on the Sindhi writers from India. This is quite possible that Sindh, presently part of Pakistan may appear in our discussion as this has passed only 70 years since the partition of the country which forced Indian Sindhi community to leave the motherland of many generations of their forefathers. Many of the contributors to Sindhi literature - Sindhi writers were born in Sindh though they live and worked in India. This might be the Rashtriya Kavi Padam Shri Dada Hundraj Dukhayal or unparalleled Sindhi writer poet Padma Shri Prof Ram Panjwani.

When we are discussing about Sindhi writers we must mention Sindhi women. Sindhi literature has revolutionary woman writers like Popati Hiranandani [Sindhi Sahitya Academy Award 1982] , Indira Vaswani, Maya Rahi and many more who have contributed to enrich the Sindhi literature. Many of Sindhi women have contributed poetry.

We will start list of Sindhi writers from India with Tirth Basant who wrote a biography of the famous Sindhi Saint Bhagat Kanwarram Sahib with Title "Kanwar" and was first awardee of Sindhi Sahitya Academy award in 1959.

Sun Moon Lake

Sun Moon Lake (; Thao: "Zintun") is a lake in Nantou County, Taiwan. It is the largest lake in Taiwan. Sun Moon Lake is one of the Eight Views of Taiwan. The lake was named because the east side of the lake looks like a sun, and the west side of the lake looks like a moon.

The lake is famous because the scenery looks very beautiful. In the morning and evening, there are clouds and mist with the rising or setting sun. The area around the lake is one of Taiwan's national scenic areas.

The land around the lake is home to the Thao tribe. They are an aboriginal people. According to legend, Thao hunters discovered Sun Moon Lake after chasing a deer. The deer led them to the lake. They found that the lake was beautiful and had lots of fish. An island in the middle of the lake is thought of as the worship place for the Thao people.

The lake was called Lake Candidius in the past. It was named after the missionary Georgius Candidius. The lake was first called Sun Moon Lake in 1821, in a book called "Travels to Shueilishe" by Deng Chuan-an. In the Qing dynasty, Chinese people began moving to the area around Sun Moon Lake. Many people wanted to open restaurants, hotels, and stores there.

When Taiwan was ruled by Japan, they made many changes. The first power plants were built in 1934. It was being built for 15 years and the project began in 1919. The Jiji Line railroad was built to help the construction of the power plants. Lalu Island was renamed "Jade Island". The Japanese built a large dam in 1931 that made the lake much bigger. In 1946, the new Chinese government renamed the lake "Kuanghua Island". The name stayed that way until the 921 earthquake in 1999 that damaged the island. After the earthquake, the island was renamed Lalu Island. It was renamed because the Taiwanese government wanted to help keep the Thao culture.

In 1967, an Aboriginal Culture Centre was created to help preserve the Thao culture. In 1975, the centre was opened. In 1990, a yacht turned upside down while in the water. It caused 57 people to die. Only 25 people lived. In 2012, a picture of Sun Moon Lake was used in the People's Republic of China passports. It made the Taiwanese government angry because they say that Taiwan and Sun Moon Lake is not part of the People's Republic of China.

Sun Moon Lake is above sea level. It is deep. Many mountains and forests are around the lake.

The water of the lake is very clear and crystal-like. There is an island in the middle of the lake that is called Lalu Island. The public is not allowed on the island because it is only allowed for aboriginal uses.

Sun Moon Lake is in a warmer area. The average temperature there is 21 °C.

There are many museums and monuments around the lake. The town Ita Thao has many shops and businesses. They are mainly owned by people of the Thao tribe. The Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village is very close to Sun Moon Lake. It opened in 1986 and helps teach about Aboriginal culture. It has beautiful gardens and forests. There is a gondola that people ride over the forests next to the lake.

People can ride bicycles around the lake. There are many bike trails around the lake. There are also many hiking trails around the lake that go up Mount Maolan.

Kuntala Kumari Sabat

Kuntala Kumari Sabat (8 February 1901 – 23 August 1938) was an Odia poet during colonial India.

Kuntala Kumari Sabat was born on 8 February 1901, at Jagadalpur in Bastar region. Her parents were Daniel and Monica. Shortly after her birth, her parents went to Burma with family. So Kuntala Kumari passed her early childhood in Burma with her parents. Then she returned to Khurda with her mother Monica after her father got remarried at Burma. She completed her early school education at Ravenshaw Girl’s School and higher study at the Medical School, Cuttack. Kuntala Kumari composed poems during her school days. She came out successfully from the medical school and became popular as a doctor with her sincerity and simplicity.

Kailash Rao was her literary teacher who guided her literary activities. Kuntala Kumari enrolled herself as a member of ‘Nava Vidhan’, the ‘Brahmo Society’. She got wide applause when poems, ‘Anjali’ came out. She won praise from almost all the literary figures of Orissa. A leading cultural association of women conferred on her the title ‘Utkal Bharati’. Gopal Chandra Praharaj and Pallikabi Nanda Kishore Bal loved her and adopted her as their daughter. Kuntala Kumari joined a maternity welfare centre, which was newly opened at Cuttack in 1925. She left for Delhi on 1st July 1928. The same year she got married to Krishna Prasad. New phase of life began, yet she did not leave her writings. She had written in English : A True Patriotic Litterateur and Reflection of Her Literary Works on Gandhian Movement Dr. Janmejay Choudhury Bengali and Hindi and contributed to a number of nonOriya journals and edited a number of Hindi journals at Delhi. During her stay at Delhi, she presided over the ‘All India Arya Mahila Sammilani’ at Bareli. During this time also she was invited by the Allahabad University and Benaras Hindu University to deliver lectures. She was the president of the students federation at Aligarh. She was made the chair-person of a reputed social organisation founded by Harbilash Sarada for the introduction of widow marriage and abolition of child marriage. While at Delhi she took steps to encourage, publish and project Oriya literature. At Delhi, Kuntala Kumari was also associated with eminent writers like , Yeasshpal Jee Jain, S.H. Batsayan and a host of Hindi writers. ‘Hindi Pracharini Sabha’ conferred on her the title of ‘Bharat Kavinetri.’

As a disciple of Gandhi she claimed independence as the birthright of Indian people. She took up the task of awakening the women. She encouraged them to join the National Movement under Gandhian leadership. During the noncooperation movement she gave a clarion call to the people of Orissa to fight for freedom. In a real sense she was a visionary and a rebel. 

No doubt, Kuntala Kumari had a lot of patriotic fervour in her. She had derived a special pride in herself by portraying Gandhi, Nehru and the spinning wheel in her lucid poems. The Oriya youths plunged headlong into the noncooperation movement being addicted to her war songs. It ignited the sparks in them spontaneously, so to say rapidly. She composed beautiful numerous patriotic poems and songs. Her first collection of poems came out in 1922. Then it was followed by ‘Uchhwas’ – 1924, ‘Archana’ – 1927, ‘Sphulinga’ – 1929, ‘Ahwan’ – 1930, ‘Prem Chintamani’ – 1930, ‘Oriyanka Kandana’ – 1937, ‘Garjat Krishaka’ – 1939.4 Her love for man, nature and nation is reflected in her poems. She had a deep hatred for superstitions and conventions, raised her voice against high and mighty. She always tried to protest against injustice and inequalities. She renounced the heartless religious dogmas and practices. She comprehended the image of the glorious past of Orissa. 

She composed the inaugural song of ‘Utkal Sammilani’, chaired by Acharya P.C. Roy in 1924. the poems in the anthology ‘Archana’ echoes the voice of poor and lowly, the depressed and the marginalized. Her poetic longing for brave new world is expressed in most of her poems. Some of her poems published in ‘Sphulinga’, inspired the youth of Orissa and infused dynamism in them. The volume ‘Ahwan’ captures the spirit of Gandhi’s clarion call to people to join the struggle for freedom. Her poems in Ahwan created tremendous sensation. Her fame as a patriot and poet spread over the country. The yearning for liberty is always marked in her poems like ‘Garjat Krishaka’. Her poetry, in some degree, reveals all the romantic traits : “Love of nature, love of beauty, imagination, love of past and a wearied sadness.” Her writings were regularly published in the ‘Samaj’ and ‘Sahakar’ under the title ‘Delhi letters’. She expresses the socio-political life of pre-independent India and makes a zealous attempts to reform the tradition ridden society. In the novel, ‘Na-tundi’, She expresses real thing of the land. ‘Raghu Arakhit’ is one of her most outstanding works. It narrates the social character regarding marriage, where a compensation was given to the bride’s family.

Kuntala Kuamri’s voice was more reflected in her poetry anthologies AHWAN (the call) and Gadajata Krishaka (Feudatory Farmer). The following stanza provides enough stimulus to adorn the spirit of mankind. Oh ! my compatriot !! The man is not born to die of reminiscence or to sink in somewhere It is never a human fate That gets terminated through a happiness living After being condemned to the fretful glooms of failure in a deprived morbid prison of ever – disciplined humiliating; Thus great Earth is never a decaying caravan or a lady nurturing death.

One of the session of Utkal Sammilani was held at Balasore on 2nd August 1931 with Kuntala Kumari in chair. Jahnabi Devi was the chairperson of the reception. Nearly twelve hundred people all over Orissa attended. This meeting was also attended by more than a thousand women. In her speech as the chairman of the Reception Committee Jahnabi Devi refuted the universally accepted view of women’s inability to stand on their own. A central executive committee, named “All Orissa Women’s Association” was set up. Here sincere efforts were made to work out a programme for the improvement of conditions of women of Orissa. In an essay entitled “Kabi O Lekhakara Udeshya”, she raised the status of a poet by declaring that she is not limited to any time and clime. “The poet or the writer is nature’s representative. He is not confined to any particular nation or time. He belongs to all the nations, to all time and all humanity. Her death on 23rd August 1938 was a great loss for the people of Orissa.. Although she spent most of her short life outside the state, she had enough inclination to intercede the causes of its Gods and Goddesses, aquatic landscapes, rural surroundings, and the people irrespective of rich and poor alike.

Kaziranga National Park

Kaziranga National Park is a national park in India. The park is home to two-thirds of the world's great one-horned rhinoceroses. It is a World Heritage Site. It was named a Tiger Reserve by the government of India and an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.

Kaziranga is home to large breeding populations of tigers, elephants, wild water buffalo, and swamp deer. One type of swamp deer now only exists in the park.

The Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest was created in 1905. Mary Curzon, the wife of the Viceroy of India, wanted the area protected mostly to save the rhinoceros. In 1908, Kaziranga was designated a "Reserve Forest". In 1916 it was renamed "Kaziranga Game Sanctuary" then changed to “Wild Life Sanctuary” in 1950.

The park is located in both the Nagaon district and Golaghat district, in the state of Assam in India. It is about 40 kilometres (25 mi) long and 13 kilometres (8 mi) wide.

The park is crossed by four main rivers — Brahmaputra, Diphlu, Mora Diphlu and Mora Dhansiri. There are also many small water bodies.

The park is within the Brahmaputra floodplain. This means when the water in the river rises, the park is partially covered in water. Flooding happens every year which results in over half the park being underwater. In 2017, 85% of the park was underwater. At least 107 animals died because of the flooding in 2017. There are elevated areas of the park which provide retreats and shelter for animals during floods. These are called "chapories". Many artificial "chapories" have been built with the help of the Indian Army to ensure the safety of the animals.

The park has three seasons: winter, summer, and monsoon. The winter season is between November and February. It is mild and dry. The small water bodies dry up and short grass covers the bed. The summer season between March and May is hot. The animals can be found near water during these months. The rainy monsoon season lasts from June to September.

Kaziranga National Park is home to 35 major mammals. This includes 15 mammals under the highest protection in India. The One-Horned rhinoceros, Royal Bengal Tiger, Asian elephant, wild water buffalo and swamp deer are collectively known as the 'Big Five' of Kaziranga. In addition there are 
gaur, sloth bears, clouded leopards, wild boar, and several deer species. Small mammals include the rare hispid hare, mongoose, civet, pangolin, and badgers. The park also is home to several primates. These include macaques, lutungs, the Bengal slow loris, and the only ape in India - the hoolock gibbon. Kaziranga's rivers are home to the endangered Ganges dolphin.

More than 490 bird species live in Kaziranga which includes 24 globally threatened species. The park is known for its nesting colonies of Spot-billed Pelicans and Adjutants. Waterfowl which breed in or pass through Kaziranga include several rare species of geese (lesser white-fronted goose), and ducks (ferruginous pochard, Baer's pochard). Other rare riverine birds include kingfishers, herons, shanks, and terns. Raptors include the rare eastern imperial eagle, other eagles, and the lesser kestrel.

Two of the largest snakes in the world, the reticulated python and the rock python, are common inside the park. It is also home to the king cobra, Indian cobra, Russell's viper, and common krait. Fifteen species of turtle live in Kaziranga. 42 species of fishes are found in the Kaziranga area, including the unusual ocellated pufferfish.

There are four main types of plant life in Kaziranga National Park. These are alluvial inundated grasslands, alluvial savanna woodlands, tropical moist mixed deciduous forests, and tropical semi-evergreen forests. Percent coverage by vegetation is: tall grasses 41%, short grasses 11%, open jungle 29%, swamps 4%, rivers and water bodies 8%, and sand 6%.


Sleeping Beauty transposon system

Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system is a non-viral vector for gene therapy.

The SB system enables high-level stable gene transfer and sustained transgene expression in multiple primary human somatic cell types. It is a highly attractive gene transfer strategy for clinical use. Sleeping Beauty transposon-based transfection is a two-component system consisting of a transposase and a transposon containing inverted repeat/direct repeat (IR/DR) sequences that result in precise integration into a TA dinucleotide. The transposon is designed with an expression cassette of interest flanked by IR/DRs, and SB transposase mediates stable integration and reliable long-term expression of the gene of interest. It has recently been demonstrated that SB efficiently mediates gene transfer and stable gene expression in human embryonic stem cells.

Sohni Mahiwal

Sohni Mahiwal or Suhni Mehar (Punjabi: سوہنی معینوال‎, ਸੋਹਣੀ ਮਹੀਂਵਾਲ; Sindhi: سهڻي ميهار‎) is one of the four popular tragic romances of Punjab. The others are Sassi Punnun, Mirza Sahiba, and Heer Ranjha. Sohni Mahiwal is a tragic love story which reverts the classical motif of Hero and Leader. The heroine Sohni, unhappily married to a man she despises, swims every night across the river using an earthenware pot to keep afloat in the water, to where her beloved Mehar herds buffaloes. One night her sister-in-law replaces the earthenware pot with a vessel of unbaked clay, which dissolves in water and she dies in the whirling waves of the river.

The story also appears in Shah Jo Risalo and is one of seven popular tragic romances from Sindh. The other six tales are Umar Marui, Sassui Punhun, Lila Chanesar, Noori Jam Tamachi, Sorath Rai Diyach and Momal Rano commonly known as "Seven Heroines" (Sindhi: ست سورميون ‎) of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. Shah begins the story at the most dramatic moment, when a young woman cries out for help in the cold river, attacked by crocodiles. The whole chapter (Sur Sohni) is merely an extension of this dreadful and yet hoped-for moment when the vessel of her body breaks and she, faithful to her pre-eternal love-covenant with Mehar, will be forever united through death.

Sohni is one of the favourite folktales both in Sindh and Punjab.

Behavioural responses to stress in animals

Real or perceived threat in the environment, produces stress response in animals, which disrupts the internal constant environment of the animal. There are different kinds of stressors that animals can be exposed to. Animals display different kinds of stress responses as a result. Physiological changes that happen because of stress cause behavioural responses in animals. There are different types of behavioural responses: impairment of response inhibition and lack of motivation, changes in social, sexual, aggression and nurture behaviour in animals. The impact is dependent upon the type, and duration of the stress, as well as the past experiences of the animal. Behavioural responses to prolonged stress can also be transferred across generations.

Stress responses are any responses that an organism makes or goes through, in response to a stressor. A stress in accordance to Walter Cannon (1871-1945), is any disturbance that imbalances the internal environment of an organism also known as homeostasis. There are two major types of stressors that cause stress to animals: abiotic stressors and biotic stressors. Abiotic stressors are any ecological, geological, or climatological changes, that causes stress to the animal such as increased temperatures, and natural disasters. Biotic stressors are living things-related complications that causes stress; these include dominance, pollution, infection social pressures and competition.

There are different types of stress responses in an animal in response to stressors: physiological responses, behavioural responses, psychological responses, and/or physical responses. The response depends on the choice the animal makes when it is faced with danger that causes distress. Walter Canon argues that there are two possible choices that an organism may choose when stress is encountered: fight or flight responses.

There are many different types of behavioural responses to stress:


Prolonged stress in rats causes response inhibition. Stressed rats had inhibited premature responses (decreased timing of intervals to food), along with decreased intrinsic motivation to initiate a response. The decreased motivation is linked to the stress-associated reduction in incentive motivation. Decreased motivation was also seen in a study conducted by Beery and Kaufer, where they explained that stressed rodents are less likely to be motivated to interact with one another.

Social behaviours in rodents change in response to stress. Social withdrawal and general reduction in social interaction after an exposure to a stressor are evident in rodents. This is due to the underlying physiological changes that the rodent goes through. The changes that occur to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis are directly related to the changes in social behaviour. Social avoidance is another consequence of stress that can be seen in rodents. Rodents are more likely to avoid dominant rats and avoid social interactions after the exposure to a stressor.

Sexual interests change in many species when exposed to stressors. Stressed male and female rats express inhibited mating behaviour which is evident through the clear increase in the inhibitory hormone RF-amide. Masculine sexual behaviour in male rats is subject to changes in accordance to the type of stressors that the rats were subjected to. Female Zebra Finches mating choice is determined by the stressors that they are exposed to early in life, which remains consistent throughout adulthood. A study about stress effects on female songbird’s response to sexual signal for mating, indicated that the response to this specific signal can be impaired if the female is exposed to developmental stress. Behavioural changes as a result from developmental stress impairs neural responses to sexual signal, which reduces mating:


Stressed animals would choose to avoid a novel situation rather than confront it. Aggressive behaviour is associated with sex hormones, such as testosterone, and specific brain regions and systems such as the medial preoptic nucleus, prefrontal cortex-dependent response inhibition, and anterior hypothalamus. Stress negatively impacts sex hormones, which results in an imbalance and reduction in aggression related hormones and function. Chronic stress results in prefrontal cortex-dependent response inhibition. This results in reduction in aggression, thus promoting anti-predator responses.


Prolonged stress alters parental behaviour toward offspring and promotes parental neglect. Predation stress alters parents’ behaviours such as the reduction in provisioning rates, which negatively impacts the offspring’s performance. Oxytocin and vasopressin hormones are generally responsible for affiliative and pair-bonding behaviours in many species. Stress alters the level of both hormones resulting in abnormal behaviour from parents towards offspring. Levels of oxytocin decrease as a result of prolonged stress, which has been shown to reduce pair bonding behaviour and increase withdrawal behaviour. Prolactin is another important hormone that is associated with nurture by parents to offspring, and levels of this hormone can be altered as a result of stress. Reduced levels of prolactin as a result of stress decreases behaviours such as suckling, licking, and brooding.

Behavioural response to stress can go from parents to offspring. When an offspring observes the expression of behaviour such as fear in response to a stress stimulus, the same response would be elicited in the offspring when the stimulus is presented. Fear is transferred from mother to infant in response to a certain odour stimulus. Neural activity, such as the basal amygdala activity of the offspring’s brain, illustrated fear response. Parents’ behavioural response to stress can be transgenerational and can be proven via neural activity.

Taroko National Park

Taroko National Park () is a national park in Hualien County, Taiwan. It is the fourth national park in Taiwan ever created. It is the third-biggest national park in Taiwan. It features the Taroko Gorge.

The park is well known because it has beautiful mountains and cliffs.

The meaning of "Taroko" is magnificent or beautiful in the Truku language.

The area in and around the park was created by the Liwu River. The river slowly cut through the rock to create the gorge.

The Atayal and the Sedek tribes came to the area over 300 years ago. Researchers found more than 70 villages from the tribes. There was a trail to Taroko called the Northern Road. The Qing Dynasty helped improve it. The Japanese then built a road system along the coast.

Gold mining began in the area in the 17th century. It happened when the Dutch ruled Taiwan, during the Qing Dynasty, and when the Japanese ruled Taiwan. When the Japanese ruled Taiwan, they began mining the gold in the Liwu River. It began in 1918. There were plans to mine more gold in a shorter time, but World War II started and it didn't happen. Soon, when the Kuomintang ruled over Taiwan, they banned gold mining.

The park was first created in 1937 when Taiwan was ruled by the Japanese. When they created it, it was called Tsugitaka-Taroko National Park. When the Chinese government came back to Taiwan in 1945, they closed down the national park. In the 1950s, Chiang Kai-shek wanted a road that crossed Taiwan from west to east. In 1960, this road was opened, called the Central Cross-Island Highway.
It runs through the Taroko Gorge.

The park was created again in 1986. It was important because it showed that the Taiwanese government knew that they were damaging the environment.

The park has many rivers, waterfalls, and gorges. It has of cliffs. It also has 27 of the "100 Peaks of Taiwan", which includes Mount Nanhu. Mount Nanhu is high and the fifth tallest mountain in Taiwan. The area has a lot of marble and it also has the only jade found in Taiwan.

The park is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean in the east, the Dajia River in the north, and the Zhoushui River in the west. The park covers around of land and covers Hualien County, Taichung, and Nantou.

The Taroko Gorge is long.

In October to April, the temperature is around . In May to September, the temperature is around .

There are 152 kinds of birds, 46 kinds of mammals, 35 kinds of reptiles, and 21 kinds of fish in the park. They include the Formosan wild boar and the Formosan monkey.

Taroko National Park has many monuments and attractions to help people learn about the Truku people and people that built the Highway. They include the Eternal Spring Shrine (also called the Changchun Shrine), and the Taroko village. In the park, many people come to hike. There are many hiking trails in the park.

The Eternal Spring Shrine was built to honour the 226 people who died building the Central Cross-Island Highway. It has two waterfalls coming out from the building. There are many hiking trails that begin there. There is also a cave with statues in it.

Canaan (son of Noah)

According to Islam, Yam, son of Noah was the fourth son of Noah.

Yam is not in the Jewish holy book, the Torah, or the Christian holy book, the Bible. Those two books talk about Yam's older brothers, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, but Yam is only in the Muslim holy book, the Qur'an. 

In the Muslim version of the story of the Great Flood, Yam did not believe in God the way his father, mother and brothers did. They followed God's instructions and Noah built a large boat, the ark, in time to survive the flood, but Yam drowned instead.

According to the Qur'an, Noah asked Yam to come with him on the boat, but Yam decided to climb a mountain instead: "O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers." Canaan said, "I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water." Noah said, "There is no protector today from the decree of The Lord our God, except from whom He gives mercy." Then it is mentioned that Yam drowned.

The holy books of the Jews, Christians and Muslims also talk about Canaan (son of Ham), Noah's grandson. This Canaan is still alive after the flood. One Jewish scholar thinks this Canaan might have been Noah's son and not grandson. So this could be the same Canaan or it could be another person with the same name.

Positron emission tomography

Positron Emission Tomography (often called PET) is a medical imaging technique. A specially constructed device can show the path and distribution of a weakly radioactive substance. This substance is called tracer. The tracer dissolves in the blood, which will carry it the brain. There, it concentrates around brain structures that are particularly active. A PET scan detects the radioactivity and converts it into a digital image of the brain, highlighting the active areas. PET scans are often used to detect tumors. Different tracers are used for different kinds of scans. Very often, the tracers are similar to sugar, or are sugars which have been specially modified for the purpose.

The machinery which can detect these substances is expensive. The tracers have a half-life of around 30-60 minutes, Producing the tracer is difficult, and expensive. Because of different factors, the tracers need to be prepared for the event, they cannot be mass-produced.

Meissner effect

The Meissner effect is when a magnetic field is pushed out of a superconductor when it becomes superconducting. If you were to put a superconductor in the field of a big magnet and you looked just inside the superconductor, you would see that the magnetic field was much smaller than it was outside. The deeper in you looked, the closer it would be to zero. This is one of the ways that superconductors are not the same as perfect conductors, which do let magnetic fields pass through them.

The effect was discovered by Walter Meissner and Robert Ochsenfeld in 1933. They saw that because the magnetic field cannot go through the superconductor, the field right outside the superconductor becomes stronger.

One example of the Meissner effect is a magnet levitating above a superconducting plate cooled by liquid nitrogen. In order to stop the magnetic field from going into the superconductor, the superconductor acts like a magnet pointing the opposite direction. This repels the real magnet and stops it from coming any closer.

Ham sandwich theorem

The ham sandwich theorem is a math theorem that says that a number of objects in the same number of dimension can be cut into two equal parts with a cut that is one dimension less.

One dimension is a line. A section of the line can be cut exactly in half with a single point.

Two dimensions is a flat sheet. Two shapes on this sheet can be cut exactly in half with a single line.

Three dimensions is space. Three objects in space can be cut exactly in half with a single flat sheet.

Four dimensions is a hyperspace. Four hyper-objects can be cut exactly in half with a single space.

The theorem is called the ham sandwich theorem because sandwiches are made of three dimensional pieces of bread that are cut in half with a flat sheet, like a slice of ham. If there were three pieces of bread, it would be possible to make one cut along a plane to divide each piece of bread into two equal pieces. If a piece of ham is then put between each sliced piece of bread, the result would be three ham sandwiches.

Kaji Khalak family

Kaji Khalak family is a noble group of four families that served the senior most state affairs in the Kingdom of Nepal. These families belonged to Kshatriya varna and were member of Kshetri caste within the Khas group. The primary four families who were granted the hereditary title of Kaji were - Thapa, Pande, Basnet and Kunwar. These four families were the apex of noble families in the court of Hindu Shah dynasty of Gorkha. Besides them the family of noble Bhandaris led by Jasvanta Bhandari, Parath Bhandari, Gagan Singh Bhandari, etc were minor members of the Kshetri Kaji group.

Thapa Kajis are the age old warriors and administrators who served in the Shah court. These consists of Bhimsen Thapa and Amar Simha Thapa family that came from Gorkha and various families of Kshetri Thapa came to serve the nation. They were added lately in comparison to Pandes. But, rightfully Thapa Kshetris served the nation vigorously to rise through the ranks. They are credited to defending their motherland in the Anglo-Nepalese War.

Pande Kajis are the group of warriors and administrators who served Gorkha Kingdom from its origin. There were many Pande courtiers serving long generations in the Gorkha Kingdom since 1559. Bangshidhar "Kalu" Pande (1713-1757) was selected as Kaji (Chief Minister) of Gorkha under King Prithvi Narayan Shah, after he received popular mandate from the residents of Gorkha. Pande family was tied maritally with Basnyat family. King Prithvi Narayan Shah conducted marriage between Kalu Pande's only daughter Chitra Devi Pande and Shivaram Singh Basnyat's second son Kehar Singh Basnyat.

He was killed due to palace conspiracy on 1785. Pande Kajis ran and dominated the Nepalese administration till the death of the Mul Kaji (Chief Minister) Damodar Pande, who happens to be the third and youngest son of Kaji Kalu Pande. After he was given death penalty on 1804, Pande Kajis was pushed out of the central power by the Thapa Kajis.

The Basnyat Kaji family was established by leading military commander Shivaram Singh Basnyat who was of Shreepali clan. He was a prominent courtier of King Prithvi Narayan Shah. The third son of Senapati Shivaram, Abhiman Singh Basnyat became the Mul Kaji (Chief Minister) of Kingdom of Nepal. His nephew Kirtiman Singh Basnyat, eldest child of marital ties between Basnyats and Pandes, became Mul Kaji (Chief Minister) of Nepal on 1794. He was regularly dominated by his maternal uncle Damodar Pande on court politics. After death of Kirtiman Singh, his brother briefly controlled the office of Mul Kaji. Basnyats were completely out of central power after that and supported Pandes due to their previous marital ties.

Kunwars were initiated in the Darbar politics through influential Sardar Ramkrishna Kunwar. A branch of Kunwars led by "Kaji" Jang Bahadur Kunwar, renamed themselves as Rana after 1848.

There were many Bhandari nobles; Parath, Gagan Singh, Jashwanta. Gagan Singh Bhandari was influential Kaji during 1845-46. He had 7 battalions under his control before his murder by Jung Bahadur Kunwar .

Subprefectures in France

In France, a subprefecture () is the administrative center of a departmental arrondissement that does not contain the prefecture for its department. The term also applies to the building that houses the administrative headquarters for an arrondissement.

The civil servant in charge of a subprefecture is the subprefect, assisted by a general secretary. Between May 1982 and February 1988, subprefects were known instead by the title "commissaire adjoint de la République".

Where the administration of an arrondissement is carried out from a prefecture, the general secretary to the prefect carries out duties equivalent to those of the subprefect.

The municipal arrondissements of Paris, Lyon, and Marseille are divisions of the city (or commune) rather than the prefecture, and so are not arrondissements in the same sense.


Zibelemärit

The Zibelemärit (Bernese German dialect; English: Onion market) is an annual market with aspects of a fair in the old town of Bern, Switzerland. It takes place the fourth Monday in November.
Historical research indicates that the Zibelemärit originated in the 1850s with marmettes, farmer's wives from around Murten, coming to Bern at around St. Martin's Day to sell their produce. According to a local story, the Zibelemärit is a much older festivity though. According to this legend, the Bernese awarded the people from the nearby city of Fribourg the right to sell onions in the city in reward for their aid after a fire that destroyed much of Bern in 1405.

As the name indicates, it is mainly onions that are sold on the Zibelemärit. Bernese farmers, who are proud of their decorative onion tresses and onion wreaths, also sell other onion products on the market, including Zwiebelkuchen (onion pie), onion soup and onion sausages. Decorative chains of sugar onions are also popular with children.

The Zibelemärit opens very early in the day, at around 03:00 to 04:00. Later in the morning, the narrow alleys are usually packed tight with people, which is what the Bernese call the Gstungg. A general confetti battle in which mostly children participate ensues at four o'clock in the afternoon, officially ending the market.

Ion exchange chromatography

Ion exchange chromatography (or ion chromatography) is a process in chromatography that separates ions and polar molecules based on their attraction to the ion exchanger. It works on almost any kind of charged molecule—including large proteins, small nucleotides, and amino acids. The two types of ion chromatography are: "anion-exchange" and "cation-exchange" chromatography. They are used in protein purification, water analysis, and quality control.

The water-soluble and charged molecules such as proteins, amino acids, and peptides bind to moieties which are oppositely charged by forming ionic bonds to the insoluble stationary phase.The equilibrated stationary phase is made of an ionizable functional groups where targeted molecules of mixtures are separated and quantified while passing through the column. A cationic stationary phase is used to separate anions and an anionic stationary phase is used to separate cations.

La Chaux-de-Fonds

La Chaux-de-Fonds is the capital city of the district of La Chaux-de-Fonds in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. After Geneva and Lausanne, it is the third-largest city in the French-speaking part of the country. As of December 2016, 38,965 people lived there.

The famous architect Le Corbusier, the writer Blaise Cendrars and the car maker Louis Chevrolet were born there.

In 2009, La Chaux-de-Fonds and Le Locle, its sister city, have jointly been awarded UNESCO World Heritage status for their exceptional universal value.

The city was founded in 1656. The region was first inhabited around 10,000 years ago (Epipaleolithic). A skull and other traces have been found in caves nearby.

In the middle of the 14th century, the region was colonized from the southern Val-de-Ruz. La Chaux-de-Fonds is first mentioned in 1350 as "la Chaz de Fonz". In 1378 it was mentioned as "Chault de Font".

The region was under the authority of the lords of Valangin. In the 15th and 16th centuries, a second wave of colonization came from the so-called "Clos de la Franchise" (the valleys of Le Locle and La Sagne). Agriculture was the main activity but the village remained small. In 1531 there were only about 35 people living there. The first church was built in 1528. By 1530, La Chaux-de-Fonds, like the rest of the Valangin lands, converted to the new Reformed faith. The Lord of Valanginian, René de Challant, fixed the boundaries of the parish in 1550. The church and parish provided a political structure and a small community of Valanginian citizens, free farmers and peasants grew up around the church. By 1615 there were 355 people living in the village. In 1616, the low and middle jurisdiction over La Chaux-de-Fonds moved to Le Locle and La Sagne, while the high court remained in Valanginian. The agriculture, supplemented by mills on the banks of the Doubs, continued to dominate. However, at the end of the 16th century, the city became an important crossroad between Neuchâtel, Franche-Comté and the Bishopric of Basel.

The community grew during the Thirty Years' War, mainly because of its strategic position for trade. Economic activity accelerated in the 18th century with the development of the city's lace and watchmaking industries. Pierre Jacquet-Droz, best known for his automata, was a particularly prominent watchmaker of this era.

In 1794, the city was devastated by fire. Charles-Henri Junod created the new city's plan in 1835, and the city is now known for its "modern," grid-like plan, in comparison with most European cities' meandering streets. The central avenue is named the Avenue Léopold Robert.

The city's economy is based on industry and watch manufacturers.

Many watch companies started in La Chaux de Fonds:

La Chaux-de-Fonds is twinned with the town of Frameries, Belgium.

Pliny's Comedy and Tragedy villas

Pliny's Comedy and Tragedy villas were two Roman villas owned by Pliny the Younger in the 1st century. They were on the shores of Lake Como in northern Italy. Pliny had several villas on Lake Como. He wrote to his friend Voconius Romanus that the Comedy villa and the Tragedy villa were his two favorites. In Italy, the villas are called Villa Commedia and Villa Tragedia. In Italian, "commedia" means "comedy" and "tragedia" means "tragedy".

In his letter to Voconius Romanus Pliny also wrote that the Tragedy villa was on a hill above the lake but that the Comedy villa was right on the water's edge. Their names come from the theatre of ancient Greece and Rome. Pliny said that the villa on the hill was like the actors in tragedies who wore platform boots. He named that villa "Tragedy". The villa down by the water was like the actors in comedies who wore flat slippers. He named that villa "Comedy". Both villas were destroyed long ago. No one is sure exactly where they stood.

Most people think that the Tragedy villa was in Bellagio, a small town on Lake Como. People are less sure where the Comedy villa was. The historian Paolo Giovio (1483-1552) thought that by the 16th century the Comedy villa was under the water of Lake Como near the village of Lenno. The geographer Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598) also wrote that the Comedy villa was in Lenno. But in 1876 a Roman mosaic floor and many Roman coins were found in Lierna, another small town on Lake Como. Many people there now think that the mosaic floor was part of the Comedy villa. In the early 20th century the French geographer Élisée Reclus wrote that Lierna was the site of one of Pliny's villas, but he did not say which one.

In 1751 John Boyle, 5th Earl of Orrery, published his English translation of Pliny's letters. The letter to Voconius Romanus describing the Comedy and Tragedy villas was illustrated with an imaginary picture of the Comedy villa drawn by . The art historian Pierre de la Ruffinière du Prey, has said that the villa in Wale's drawing looks like Alexander Pope's villa on the River Thames in London. Alexander Pope was a friend of John Boyle. Pliny's own description of the Comedy villa in his letter said that its terrace was gently curved like the shore of the lake. He could fish directly from his bedroom window. He said that lying in his bed at the Comedy villa was like lying in a fishing boat on the lake.

Microservices

In classical software architecture, the architecture is often layered. There is one layer for the user interface, another for the application logic, and yet another for accessing persistent data (such as a database). In classical software architecture, an application server is used, which will run the different services (such as different entry points of a web site, or different parts of the business application). The problem with this approach is that such application servers often do not scale very well, they need a lot of resources, and services are often tightly coupled.

Microservices are patterns of Software architecture: The approach is similar to the pattern described above, but the services are very small: very often they only provide one or two very specific functions. To get the same situation as above, these services must interact with each other. Very often they do this using RESTful service calls. Each microservice still has the parts of the user interface layer, the application layer, and the layer to access persistent data. Very often, microservices run in an application container. When the load requires it, special software in the application container can be used to run several instances (or copies) of the specific service.

Microservices is a specialization of an implementation approach for service-oriented architectures (SOA) used to build flexible, independently deployable software systems. The microservices approach is a first realisation of SOA that followed the introduction of DevOps and is becoming more popular for building continuously deployed systems.

Intermediate value theorem

The intermediate value theorem says that if a function, formula_1, is continuous over a closed interval formula_2, and is equal to formula_3 and formula_4 at either end of the interval, for any number, c, between formula_3 and formula_4, we can find an formula_7 so that formula_8. 

This means that if a continuous function's sign changes in an interval, we can find a root of the function in that interval. For example, if formula_9 and formula_10, we can find an formula_7 in the interval formula_12 that is a root of this function, meaning that for this value of x, formula_13, if formula_1 is continuous.

Ogdoad (Egyptian)

In Egyptian mythology, the Ogdoad are a group of eight deities (divine beings) worshipped in Hermopolis. The gods of the Ogdoad were mostly seen as humans with the heads of animals, or just depicted as snakes and frogs. They were arranged in four male-female pairs, with the males associated with frogs, and the females with snakes. Their story is part of the Egyptian creation myth.

The Egyptians believed that before the world was formed, there was a watery mass of dark, directionless chaos. In this chaos lived the Ogdoad of Khmunu (Hermopolis). These were four frog gods and four snake goddesses of chaos. Together they represented balance in infinity.

Their names were Nun and Naunet (water), Amun and Amaunet (invisibility), Heh and Hauhet (infinity) and Kek and Kauket (darkness).

The chaos existed without the light, and thus Kek and Kauket came to represent this darkness. They also symbolized obscurity, the kind of obscurity that went with darkness, and night.

The Ogdoad were the original great gods of Iunu (On, Heliopolis) where they were thought to have helped with creation, then died and retired to the land of the dead where they continued to make the Nile River flow and the sun rise every day.

Surfactant

A surfactant is a chemical that lowers the surface tension of a liquid. Less surface tension lets the liquid soak into things better, and can also let bubbles form easier. A liquid that bubbles and soaks into things is better at cleaning, so surfactants are used in soap.

Every year, 15 million tons of surfactants are made. Half of them are used in soap; the rest are used in many different ways including making toothpaste and concrete.

One popular surfactant is sodium laurel sulfate, also called sodium dodecyl sulfate or SDS. SDS is a cheap, commonly used surfactant that is used in almost every toothpaste and many shampoos, body washes, and shaving creams.

Small amounts of most common surfactants are usually not harmful to people or animals, although if they get into eyes they can be painful. Very large amounts of surfactants can kill animals, but the amount varies depending on the surfactant.

Larger amounts of surfactants can be a problem in the environment, where they let the soil hold more water than usual, but this problem usually goes away in a few days.

Packet switching

In telecommunications, packet switching is a method of grouping data that is transmitted over a digital network into "packets".

Composed of a header and a payload:
A header is used by networking hardware to direct packets to its destination,
A payload is the thing extracted after it has reached its destination (thanks to the header)

The workstation creates a packet, and stamps it with the destination's IP Address and forwards it to a router, the router's job is to find out how to get the packet to the desired destination.
Breaking communication down into packets allows the same information to be shared amongst many users in a network.
A type of small network where packets (small units of data) are routed through a network based on the destination address contained in each packet.

“A data packet is a unit of data made into a single package that travels along a given network path. Data packets are used in Internet Protocol (IP) transmissions for data that navigates the Web, and in other kinds of networks.”

Unit load device

A unit load device, or ULD, (ULD) is a pallet or a container. It is used to load luggage, freight, and mail on wide-body aircraft and specific narrow-body aircraft. It allows a large quantity of cargo to be bundled into a single unit. As with other cargo transport, this leads to fewer units to load, it saves ground crews time and effort and helps prevent delayed flights. Each ULD has its own packing list (or "manifest") so that its contents can be tracked.

There are two kinds of unit load devices: pallets and boxes. The boxes are similar to shipping containers: they are mostly made with metal (usually aluminum) and have standard attachment points that let them be moved easily. The pallets are usually metal with sides that attach to a cargo net. Below is a table of sizes of ULDs. The volume listed is the internal volume, the size of the inside of the container.

Irrawaddy River

The Irrawaddy River or Ayeyarwady River is a river that flows from north to south through Myanmar. It is the country's largest river and most important commercial waterway. It begins where the N'mai and Mali rivers join together. The river ends at the Andaman Sea. The drainage basin is about and covers a large part of Myanmar.no

The delta of the Irrawaddy begins about north of the city of Hinthada. The westernmost distributary of the delta is the Pathein (Bassein) River and the easternmost is the Yangon River. The land in the delta is low but it is not flat. The soil is made of fine silt.

A large number of people live in the delta region. Because the soil can be as low as 3 metres above sea level, it is an important area for growing rice.

On 2 May 2008, Cyclone Nargis was a major disaster for the delta. The cyclone reportedly killed at least 77,000 people with over 55,900 missing, and left about 2.5 million homeless.

Annual rainfall in the delta region is about 2,500 mm (100 in). Most of the rain falls during the monsoons which happen between May and November.

There is not a complete list of all the types of fish found along the Irrawaddy River. In 2008, it was estimated that the region is home to 119–195 species of fish found nowhere else in the world.

One of the best-known species in the river is the Irrawaddy dolphin. The dolphin is listed as a vulnerable species, meaning it is at risk to become endangered. In 2016 officials report only 62 dolphins are left in Myanmar.

There are several different ecoregions along the river.

The Irrawaddy River begins where the streams of the Nmai and Mali join. Both of these rivers begin in high and remote mountains near the border with Tibet. In this area rain falls at all seasons of the year, but mostly in the summer. The valleys and lower hill ranges are covered with an evergreen rainforest. At elevations above there are forests of oak and pine. Above , are forests of rhododendrons. Above there are evergreen conifer forests.

The central basin receives little rain. The humidity is always high, which is important for plant life. The area is mostly covered in plains. The forests are mostly filled with teak. The natural habitats in this area have been changed for farming. The wildlife includes many birds, small mammals and reptiles such as the huge Burmese python.

The delta area has mangroves and freshwater swamp forests. It is an extremely fertile area. The lands of the upper and central parts of the delta are almost all used for farming, especially rice. The southern part becomes the Myanmar Coast mangroves. This area has marshes with oxbow lakes, islands, and streams.

Many types of bird are found in the delta. These include the great cormorant, Anatidae, and red junglefowl.

Large mammals include the Malayan sambar deer, Indian hog deer, and wild boar. Other large mammals have only a small number of animals in the delta region. Some species reported to be present include the leopard, Bengal tiger, crab-eating macaque, wild dog, and otters.

The saltwater crocodile can be found in the southern part of the delta. There are five species of sea turtle that are known to nest in Myanmar.

The Irrawaddy River has five major tributaries. Tributaries are rivers that flow into a larger river. The rivers joining the Irrawaddy are, from north to south:


The river flows through or past the following cities:

Hilary B. Price

Hilary B. Price (born 1969) is an American cartoonist. She is known for creating a comic strip called "Rhymes with Orange" which is published digitally on her website and in over one hundred newspapers across the country. At the age of 25 she became the youngest cartoonist to ever be nationally syndicated. She won the Silver Reuben for "Best Newspaper Panel Cartoon" from the National Cartoonists Society four times, in 2007 and 2009, 2012 and 2014.

Price grew up in Weston, Massachusetts. She studied English at Stanford University. She originally had no intentions of becoming a cartoonist, but after a few years she began submitting strips to The New Yorker but they were never picked up. She was then hired as a freelance copywriter for an ad agency in San Francisco. Whilst there she submitted her comics to the San Francisco Chronicle and they were published in the opinion and book review section. Her success at the Chronicle inspired her to begin submitting her work for syndication. In 1995, Price received a call from King Features Syndicate to request more samples of her work and by June of that year she was syndicated. Price was just 25 years old at the time which makes her the youngest cartoonist to achieve national syndication.
Price publishes her panels almost daily to her website named after her strip ("Rhymes with Orange"). The title is derived from the belief that no English word rhymes with orange.

Price's panels often feature animals such as cats and dogs in lieu of humans and doesn't feature any reoccurring characters.

Her strips's format is also unique in design. A typical Price comic features one long panel where the illustration and dialogue are found, and to the left is a smaller panel with the title of the strip and often a secondary punchline and smaller illustration. This setup has the reader going from right to left rather than the typical left to right found in most western comics.

In addition to her website her work has also appeared in "Parade Magazine", "The Funny Times", "People" and "Glamour".

Price has released several compilations of her work in books, one of those being "Hanukkomics" in which she gathered all of her comics about Jewish culture and holidays.

Her inspirations for comics include "Dr. Seuss for the rhymes, Shel Silverstein for the clever word play and black-and-white illustrations, and "The New Yorker" cartoonists Roz Chast, Sam Gross and George Booth." But her main influence comes from greeting card artist Sandra Boynton. In the eighth grade, Price learned that Boynton, who she had assumed was a male, was in fact a female. This opened up the idea to Price that women could do "funny drawings" too.

Price is an openly gay, Jewish woman who lives in Florence, Massachusetts with her partner, dog, and cat. In her free time Price enjoys playing women's ice hockey.


Umberto Pettinicchio

Umberto Pettinicchio (born 1943) is an Italian painter and sculptor. He was born in Torremaggiore, a town in Apulia. Later, he moved to Milan. In Milan he studied art at the Accademia di Brera. He had his first exhibition in 1969. His early paintings were in the expressionist style. His later paintings were more abstract. His 1981 painting "The Death of the Bull" is held in the Museo de Arte Moderno y Contemporáneo de Santander y Cantabria.

Umberto Pettinicchio was trained at the Brera Academy and in 1969 he began to exhibit in his first solo exhibitions, including at the Nuova Sfera, Milan, 1973 (curated by Carlo Munari), in 1977 at the Rome Triptych, in 1974 at Il Castello di Milano, in 1975 (edited by Raffaele De Grada). In 1976 Pettinicchio opened his Milan studio in via Bolzano, where he produced some of his important works with which he achieved international fame.

In the 1980s, he was always present at the most important exhibitions (at the Salotto di Como in 1980, at Il Castello di Milano in 1981, at Il Mercante di Milano in 1982), and was also enriched by important Spanish exhibitions (Sargadelos, Barcelona, ​​1982 , Piquio, Santander, 1982, at the VIII Madrid Biennial, 1983).

The artist Umberto Pettinicchio has often dealt with the human figure in his pictorial research, initially in an expressionist style. Subsequently, his pictorial style becomes more and more abstract until finally reaching the Informal. Only a vaguely perceptible appearance remains of the figure, while, from a formal point of view, everything is distorted in the artist's pictorial gestures. Pettinicchio's gesture breaks the dimensional planes and transforms the human figure into a shapeless matter marked by large black lines. The one carried out by Pettinicchio seems a kind of brutalist operation in the vein of a Jean Dubuffet, but while the French gave much more importance to the subject, our artist solves everything through pictorial writing.

Opinion poll

An opinion poll shows what a large group of chosen people think about the poll's topic. An opinion poll usually has a set of choices from which the chosen person may choose as his opinion. The number of people that select each choice is recorded. These numbers are then written as percentages of the overall group. This gives a general idea of how many people in a certain group agree or disagree on a certain topic. One of the fundamental principles of opinion polling is selecting a representative sample from a larger population. The goal is to ensure that the group chosen for the survey accurately reflects the demographics and characteristics of the entire population. This is typically done through random sampling methods to minimize bias.

Ethereum

Ethereum is a system on the Internet where people can make deals. Ether is type of money which uses the Ethereum system to make sure that every person gets the right amount in every deal.

Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Many people donated money to support the development of the system in what was one of the first initial coin offerings. The system came online on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins.

In 2016, Ethereum split into two separate versions: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

Ethereum has started implementing a series of upgrades called Ethereum 2.0, which includes a transition to proof of stake and aims to increase transaction throughput using sharding.

"Ether" is a type of money that is "decentralized", which means that there's no company, bank or government that oversees it. Instead, it uses the "Ethereum" network of computers spread around the world, which keep track of every payment of ether. As in other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum keeps track of payments by using a blockchain, which is a growing registry of every payment. This blockchain is open for everyone to read, and it is spread across the network so that everyone can check what payments have been made. This also protects against hacking or theft of money from the system, because if the blockchain was to be altered in some computers then it would be noticed that it is not identical with the others.

"Ether" is a form of cryptocurrency, which means that it is "decentralized", and also means that people can use it for payments without revealing who they are. Instead, people can use the Ethereum system by "addresses" (also called "keys") which they can keep secret from others. The Ether coin can be transferred between accounts and used as a payment mechanism. The Ether coin is mined and used as compensation to miners for verifying transactions.

After bitcoin, digital currency ether is the second most widespread cryptocurrency. However, Ethereum – the blockchain platform that supports ether transactions – has a few technological advantages over the market leader. Whereas practically the only use for bitcoin is in monetary transactions, Ethereum offers the additional option of linking the transactions to contractual conditions in what are known as smart contracts. These are small computer programs that are executed when the relevant monetary transaction has been concluded or, conversely, that trigger a monetary transaction or data delivery once they have been executed.

Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of "Bitcoin Magazine" in late 2013.

Ethereum was announced at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January 2014. During the conference, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and Anthony Di Iorio (who financed the project) rented a house in Miami with Buterin to develop a fuller sense of what Ethereum might become.

In January 2018, Ethereum was the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, behind only Bitcoin. As of 2021, it maintained that relative position.

In 2019, Ethereum Foundation employee Virgil Griffith was arrested by the US government for presenting at a blockchain conference in North Korea.

On 27 August 2021, the blockchain experienced a brief fork that was the result of clients running different incompatible software versions.

Ethereum's founding story and team are featured in the 2021 book "The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze." "The Cryptopians" focuses on the infamous 2016 DAO hack on Ethereum. During this hack, over 3.6 million ether–about 15% of all ether in the world at the time–was stolen. Author Laura Shin writes about exciting and sometimes bad situations with the project's founding and the huge cryptocurrency rise of 2017.

Corbynmania

Corbynmania is enthusiastic support for Jeremy Corbyn who was elected as leader of the Labour Party in 2015.

His authentic, informal style and radical policies appealed to many of the young new members who had joined after the membership fee had been reduced to £3. Hundreds of supporters turned out to hear him speak at the hustings across the nation and their enthusiastic reception and support for him was dubbed "Corbynmania" by the press.

A chant of "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" has now been adopted as an anthem or chorus by his supporters. This is sung in the style of "Seven Nation Army" by The White Stripes. It attracted especial attention at the Glastonbury festival of 2017, where Corbyn appeared and spoke to the crowds.

Republic of Liberia national defence forces

The Federal republic of Liberia military book, entitled, “The History of the Liberian Armed Forces Day” before February 25, 1955, there was no Armed Forces Day as such, except the country and militia units, each of which had its own quarterly parade day enacted by law.
During those days, the regular Army then called the Liberian Frontier Force (LFF), used to combine with units of the national militia to have joint parade on special occasions, such as Independence Day, Inauguration Day, etc. However, in 1954, the late Colonel Francis M. Dean, then Assistant Chief of Staff (G-2), recommended in his annual report to the Defense authority that a day be set aside by an act of the National Legislature to be styled and known as “Old Soldier Army Festival” a day on which units of the Liberian Armed Forces throughout the nation would assemble at their respective headquarters to jointly participate in field ceremonies of parades and other planned military exercises.
Colonel Dean’s recommendation traveled through the necessary chain of command until it successfully reached the official desk of the late Commander-In-Chief, President William V.S. Tubman who, in turn, approved and submitted it to the lawmakers for legislative consideration.
How February 11 Was Chosen As Armed Forces Day
When the Liberian legislature met in session to consider colonel Dean’s recommendation for legislative enactment, it was suggested that choosing any month and date to be set aside as Army Festival would be inappropriate.
Instead, a month and date with some historical events in which a member or members of the Armed Forces had performed some marvelous deeds in the supreme interest of the nation (Liberia) and its people.
By so doing, members of the incoming generations of the Armed Forces would continue to celebrate this day under appropriate military exercises in honor and remembrance of the heroic deeds of their comrades in arms. Moreover, this suggestion was embraced with popular support. However, the only event that could quickly come to the minds of the lawmakers was the month and date of the Major Mckay Cadell incidence in 1909.
Major Cadell was the first commandant of the Liberian Frontier Force who carried on mutiny action against the Liberian Government during President Arthur Barclay’s administration, that aggression of Cadell was repelled by the first militia regiment headed by Ltc. Isaac Moart and his deputy Major.
Joseph Dennis in 1909 having reached a unanimous consensus on the month and date of Major Cadell’s event, of February 25 1955, an act of Legislature was passed, declaring May 9 of each year as Armed Forces Day with a proclamation that it should be officially observed throughout Liberia as a National holiday. When the Act was proclaimed on May 9 as the month and date of the Major Cadell’s incidence, historians everywhere disagreed and argued that the incidence occurred on February 9, 1909. This argument in turn created a demand for legislative amendment.
Consequently, on March 22, 1956, amendment was made, deleting May 9 and inserting February 9 in the Act as Armed Forces Day. Less than a year after the amendment was made, some survivors of the Major Cadell’s incidence declared that it was February 11, 1909.
Once more and finally, on January 26, 1957, the appropriate rectification was made in the Act. Major Cadell was a British officer brought to Liberia from Sierra Leone to command the Liberian Frontier Force, and with him were some Sierra Leonean soldiers whom he incited against the Liberian Government for salary arrears.
The Liberian Frontier Force thwarted their mutiny action and they were given twenty-four hours to leave Liberia. The current site of the Executive Mansion was the location of the Military Barracks named and styled “Camp Johnson”. Today, a new 2000-strong AFL is being built under the auspices of the Security Sector Reform (SSR) program.
DynCorp International is training this new 2000-strong regimented and law-abiding AFL with support from the United States Government.
Note- The Armed Forces of Liberia is 100 years, (1908-2008) and this celebration of Armed Forces Day marks the 51st observance of the day since 1957.

Physical unclonable function

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are hardware modules that can generate randomness. Their operation is based on "locked" randomness, stemming from tiny imperfections (mistakes) in the manufacturing process of hardware, which result in the production (output) of a bit-string which appears random and can be considered as unique per hardware instance (device).

Essentially, in each PUF circuit, electric current may move through this circuit in two distinct ways/paths, such as two wires. If it goes mostly through one of these ways/paths, a logical zero is produced, whereas if it goes through the other way/path, a logical one is produced. The prevalent path is chosen according to tiny details (characteristics) of the circuit, such as which wire is thicker or longer. However, the two wires have been designed to be exactly the same, and only differ because of imperfections of the manufacturing process, which cause random tiny mistakes (imperfections), such as one wire being 5 mm, and the other 5.00001 mm. Therefore, and as the choice of the prevalent path is dependent on a large number of tiny details (thickness, length, resistance of the wires, etc.), which are very difficult to determine beforehand, this choice appears as random, and can be considered as chaotic. The tiny production mistakes that affect the path choice cannot be predicted as they happen randomly in the manufacturing process. Nevertheless, after they happen, they stay like that, for example, the small difference in length between two wires will always exist after they have been manufactured, so the aforementioned path choice is "locked", although it is "random" (chaotic), and will always give the same result.

Since most contemporary hardware devices consist of millions of circuits, millions of individual choices can be made at the same time, resulting in a string (series) of bits (zeros and ones) of a very large length. Since each choice is independent and "random", the probability that two such strings will be the same becomes extremely small due to their very large length. Therefore, a PUF can be used to produce a large bit-string that will be "unique" per device and always the same, when measured under exactly the same conditions. Such a bit string can then be used in cryptography as an inherently occurring cryptographic token, such as a key for encryption. As external (environmental) conditions may affect the result of a PUF (its "random" unique bit-string output), error correction may be needed to force this result to be the same between different measurements.

Hardware, which by its nature allows for a choice of path for electricity, such as memory cells, can be easily employed in order to implement a PUF in a device, without the need of additional circuitry. Therefore, PUFs can be quite cost-efficient and lightweight.

IPhone X

The iPhone X is a smartphone designed by Apple Inc. It was revealed on September 12, 2017, at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, at the same time as they released the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The iPhone X was released in several countries on November 3, 2017. This iPhone marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, with "X" representing the symbol "ten" in Roman numerals.

The iPhone X has an OLED display which measures 5.8 inches diagonally. Apple calls this a "Super Retina Display". It has a contrast ratio (the difference between the brightest a screen can be, and the darkest) of 1,000,000:1. It is also very sharp, with a resolution of 2436-by-1125. It is also able to change its color temperature using True Tone. According to Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing, the screens Apple used in the iPhone X were made to avoid the "oversaturation" of colors that are displayed on most OLED panels by adjusting color so that it doesn't look too saturated or very intense.

It is available in two colors, Silver and Space Grey. It has a glass casing which Apple claims is "the most durable ever in a smartphone", and the entire body is made from stainless steel.

Instead of Touch ID, a fingerprint scanner, it uses Face ID, which can recognize your face, even in total darkness or in direct sunlight. It can't be fooled by photos and simple masks, because unlike other solutions, it uses infrared cameras and dot projectors to scan your face, which Apple calls the "TrueDepth camera system". It can also scan through most eyeglasses and sunglasses, and it can still recognize you even if you change your hairstyle or grow a beard. You can use Face ID for unlocking your phone or for Apple Pay.

The iPhone X has two cameras on the back. The first one is a wide 12 MP camera. It can record video at 1080p HD or 4K and slow-mo at 720p or 1080p. The second camera is a zoom camera at also 12 MP. Using the second camera, you can zoom optically, so the picture does not lose quality. Together, the two cameras can be used for Portrait mode, which blurs the background and keeps the object or person in focus, and Portrait Lighting, which also does the same thing as Portrait Mode, but you can actually choose how the lighting looks.

In the front is a 7 MP camera. Using the TrueDepth cameras, it can also do Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting, but also Animojis, which are animated emojis that copy your facial expressions.

There is no home button on the iPhone X. The front and back are made of glass, and it allows for wireless charging with a Qi charger or with Apple's own wireless charging pad, AirPower.

Because the screen, which is very different from iPhones before, apps needed to be updated so that it fills the entire screen. There are changes such as rounded corners, sensor "notch" at the top of the screen, and a sign for going to the home screen. Apple published a "Human Interface Guidelines" document for explaining and discouraged app makers from attempting to hide the changes.

Since there is no home button, it uses swipes and gestures instead, like swiping up to go to the home screen.

Buangkok MRT station

Buangkok MRT Station (NE15) is an underground MRT station in Sengkang, Singapore. It opened on 15 January 2006. It opened after the public wanted it to be opened. It is part of the North East MRT Line.

When the North East Line opened, it was one of the 2 completed MRT stations of North East Line that was not open, the other being Woodleigh which opened on 20 June 2011. This station was originally planned to be opened with 15 other stations on the North East Line. However, a few days before the opening, the operator SBS Transit decided not to open the station as the area around the station was undeveloped and the company claimed that the number of passengers would be too low to cover operating costs.

The station was maintained like any other station throughout the time before it was opened. To prepare for the station's opening, the programming had to be updated to include Buangkok. Residents had said they would be willing to walk 400 metres to the station every day.

SBS Transit expected around 3,500 passengers to use the station daily, which would be the lowest among all the stations along the line, resulting in the station making a loss. However, the actual numbers were much lower than expected during its first week of operation. Only an average of 1,386 passengers used the station each day. For comparison, Clarke Quay station, which is the second most unused station, already had more than 6,000 passenger trips daily. However, Clarke Quay was located in the Central Business District with considerable development in the area. 

From 5 January 2018, cash top ups are not accepted at the passenger service centres at this station.

There is an artwork in the station. It was made by Vincent Leow. It is called "Water, Nature and the Contemporary" (current).

Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is teaching a "software agent" how to behave in an environment by telling it how well it's doing. It is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology.

Reinforcement learning is different from supervised learning because the correct inputs and outputs are never shown. Also, reinforcement learning usually learns as it goes (online learning) unlike supervised learning. This means an agent has to choose between exploring and sticking with what it knows best.

A reinforcement learning system is made of a "policy" (formula_1), a "reward function" (formula_2), a "value function" (formula_3), and an optional "model" of the environment.

A "policy" tells the agent what to do in a certain situation. It can be a simple table of rules, or a complicated search for the correct action. Policies can even be stochastic, which means instead of rules the policy assigns "probabilities" to each action. A policy by itself can make an agent do things, but it can't learn on its own.

A "reward function" defines the goal for an agent. It takes in a state (or a state and the action taken at that state) and gives back a number called the "reward", which tells the agent how good it is to be in that state. The agent's job is to get the biggest amount of reward it possibly can in the long run. If an action yields a low reward, the agent will probably take a better action in the future. Biology uses reward signals like pleasure or pain to make sure organisms stay alive to reproduce. Reward signals can also be stochastic, like a slot machine at a casino, where sometimes they pay and sometimes they don't.

A "value function" tells an agent how much reward it will get following a policy formula_1 starting from state formula_5. It represents how "desirable" it is to be in a certain state. Since the value function isn't given to the agent directly, it needs to come up with a good guess or estimate based on the reward it's gotten so far. Value function estimation is the most important part of most reinforcement learning algorithms.

A "model" is the agent's mental copy of the environment. It's used to "plan" future actions.

Knowing this, we can talk about the main loop for a reinforcement learning episode. The agent interacts with the environment in "discrete time steps". Think of it like the "tick-tock" of a clock. With discrete time, things only happen during the "ticks" and the "tocks", and not in between. At each time formula_6, the agent observes the environment's state formula_7 and picks an action formula_8 based on a policy formula_1. The next time step, the agent receives a reward signal formula_10 and a new observation formula_11. The value function formula_12 is updated using the reward. This continues until a terminal state formula_13 is reached.

James Marriott

Sir James Marriott (29 October 1730 – 21 March 1803) was a famous British judge, politician and scholar. He is famous for being in the highest court in Britain. He judged a lot of legal trials involving boats and the British Navy, he most helped lawyers by writing a book about American law.

James Marriott was born on 29 October 1730. In June 1746 he was sent to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and graduated in 1751. Although he had wanted a job in the church, he decided to switch to law in 1755, maybe because his stepfather, a very good lawyer, told him to. He spent three years as librarian to the Duke of Newcastle. He joined the College of Advocates and began his legal job in which he wrote two books on law.

While he served the Duke of Newcastle, he began to flatter others with nice words, which gave him the job of Receiver of Land Tax for Suffolk, but did not do much else until King George III was made king in 1760, when he left Newcastle for the new king. In 1767 he was made king's advocate, mostly because there was no one else to do it. In 1767 he served as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge for a year and in 1768.

For the next ten years he kept trying to get a better job, making Lord Grafton very angry in the process.In 1778 he was knighted and made the Judge of the High Court of Admiralty, responsible for cases involving boats and the Navy. His work as king's advocate was not impressive, because of his lack of good choice-making and bad courtroom behaviors, as well as his aggressive speeches against his own co-workers. In 1781 he was elected to Parliament for Sudbury. Marriott worked for Lord Shelburne, who strongly opposed war.

The French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 caused the Navy to be used more and more, which made Marriott judge on more cases than he normally would, even though he was able to make some important decisions. He was also re-elected for his Parliament job in 1796. he had supported someone else, but then changed his mind and ran for election himself. Marriott remained in Parliament until 1802, shortly before he died.

Marriott quit his job in 1798. He returned to Twinstead Hall and stayed there until he died on 21 March 1803, having rebuilt the local church. The year before he died he wrote his most important book, "Formulare instrumentarum", a book about his job with Naval law that caused Naval law in the United States to change. He also made a lot of poems and legal books that were not important. He never married, his one try in 1760 causing both the girl and her father to say "no." Instead he took care of his mother until her death.

Pavement light

Pavement lights are usually put into sidewalks or floors to let sunlight into a room below it. They are sometimes called vault lights or sidewalk prisms. They were much used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when electric lighting was very expensive. Some cities are removing these lights, but others are keeping and restoring them.

Pavement lights give sunlight into the basements below it during the day, and the basement gives light to the sidewalk from below during the night. These lights are meant to make basements more useful in cities and places where space is scarce. In places with high rent, these lights may make an area look better, which helps landlords make more money. People with these lights can also save on electricity during the day, because the lights are clear like a window, where sunlight can go through.

Many years ago, pavement lights were advertised as a way of saving on electricity costs and making places look better. Today's science has proven that they were right.

Pavement lights are also used in floors with glass roofs. They could be put in a floor below another floor with more pavement lights, letting sunlight go through more than one floor. Manhole covers were also made with pavement lights.

Most old cities have pavement lights, or at least, they have had them in the past. These lights are about 100 years old. However, some new pavement lights are being made, even today.

It is derived from a historical Title role of Persian origin (Mīrzā), denoting the rank of a royal prince , high nobleman , or a military commander equivalent to a nobleman. It is usually defined in English as Prince of the blood.

Specifically, it was used as a title by and today signifies patriarchal lineage to the various Persian Empires, the Ottoman Empire, the Shirvanshahs and Circassians of the Caucasus, Mughal Empire or Muslim Rajputs of the Indian Subcontinent.[2] It was also a title bestowed upon members of the highest aristocracies in Tatar states, such as the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan.

The word Mīrzā is derived from the Persian term ‘Amīrzāde which literally means "Son of the Amīr" or "child of the ruler".[3] ‘Amīrzād in turn consists of the Arabic title ‘Amīr (english: Emir), meaning "commander" and "Prince", and the Persian suffix -zād, meaning "birth" or "lineage". Due to vowel harmony in Turkic languages, the alternative pronunciation Mortar (weapon) (plural morzalar; derived from the Persian word) is also used. The word Mirza means royalty in almost every old version of Persian, Arab, Caucasian, Turkish and Indian languages.

Variant spellings in English include mirzya, miriza, mirize, mirze, morsey, mursay, murse, meirsa, mirzey, mursi, murze, murza, mirza, myrza, meerza .

The titles themselves were given by the King, Sultan and Emperor (equivalent to the western Fount of honour) to their sons and grandsons, or even distant kins. Noblemen loyal to the kings also received this Title.
The title itself is derived from the title Emir. Emir, meaning "commander" or "Prince", is derived from the Semitic root "Amr", meaning "command". Originally it simply meant "commander" or "leader", usually in reference to a group of people. It came to be used as a title of governors or rulers, typically in smaller states, and usually renders the English word "Prince." The word entered English in 1595, from the French émir. It is also used in Pakistan and North India by "Muslim Rajputs".


Advent calendar

An Advent calendar is a special calendar that counts the days to Christmas through the month of December.

The advent calendar was used first by German Lutherans from 1800 to 1900, but now many Christians use them.

Advent calendars have pictures on them that show either the Christian nativity scene, Santa Claus, or a winter landscape. However, there are also many different looks, such as sports or technology. They can either be made of paper, wood or fabric.

Many Advent calendars and large cards shaped like a rectangle, with little "windows" that can be opened. There are usually 24 windows on a card, one for each day from December 1 to the day before Christmas. Each window has a number, and you open one each day. For example, on December 16, you would open the window with a '16' on it. There are sometimes pictures, poems, or even chocolate behind each window. Other calendars have Bible verses or a prayer behind the windows, which Christians use to celebrate their Advent as part of their religion. Advent calendars can also have puzzles or games behind the windows.

There are many different kinds of Advent calendars. Some are made online on social media, and some towns have made living advent calendars.

Wikipedia administrators

Wikipedia administrators are senior, trusted volunteers who have been selected by the Wikipedia community. They are also known as admins, sysops, and janitors. Administrators are chosen after a successful request for adminship. As of 2024, there are administrators on the Simple English Wikipedia. Administrators have special rights that other editors do not have.

On Wikipedia, becoming an admin is often referred to as being "given [or taking up] the mop", a term which has also been used elsewhere. 

In his book "Wikipedia – The Missing Manual", John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role. Instead, he says, admins usually "delete pages" and "protect pages involved in edit wars".

In 2006, there were about 1,000 administrators on the English Wikipedia, and in 2020 about 1,100. These administrators live in different parts of the world. 

In July 2012, it was reported that Wikipedia was "running out of administrators". This was because in 2006-2007 an average of 40-50 new administrators were selected. In the first six months of 2012 only 9 new administrators were selected. But the co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, did not believe that this was a serious problem. He also did not believe Wikipedia was running out of admins. In fact, he thought the number of admins did not change much. Wales said earlier that being an admin is "not a big deal”. He also said that "It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.” He said this in a message he sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003. 

The first Wikipedia administrators were selected by Jimmy Wales himself in October 2001. Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. The process has been said to be "akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. Lih also said, "It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was "prove you weren't a bozo". Editors can become candidates only after "extensive work on the wiki". Any editor can vote in an RfA. The result of the vote is not by the number of votes for or against, but by the agreement that has been reached. The decision if an agreement has been reached can be made only by a bureaucrat. A bureaucrat is a Wikipedia editor who is also selected by the community through a "request" process which is much stricter for them than for administrators. This RfA process was started after RfAs attracted a lot of attention. Before the middle of 2005, RfAs did not attract a lot of attention. But then RfAs started attracting groups of editors who all supported one another.

When an editor becomes an admin, they are given abilities to perform certain duties. Admins can do messy cleanup work more easily than other editors. They can delete articles. They can also protect pages, which means they can restrict editing rights to that page. Admins can block the accounts of disruptive users. When an admin blocks a user they must do so according to Wikipedia's policies. One of the policies is that a reason must be given for the block. The reason for the block is permanently logged by the software. Admins are not supposed to block other editors just to have an advantage against the blocked editor when the admin is doing editing work.

A scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that after editors are promoted to administrator status, they often focus more on articles about controversial topics than they did before. The researchers also proposed an different method for choosing administrators, in which more weight is given to the votes of experienced editors. Another paper, presented at the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, analyzed data from all 1,551 requests for adminship from January 2006 to October 2007 to find out which (if any) of the criteria recommended in Wikipedia's "Guide to requests for adminship" page were the best predictors of whether the user in question would actually become an admin. In December 2013, a similar study was published by researchers from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Warsaw which aimed to model the results of requests for adminship on the Polish Wikipedia using a model taken from Wikipedia's edit history. They found that they could "classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be good enough to recommend candidates."

Ian Erix

Ian Erix, is an American pop singer, songwriter, TV presenter, and social media personality. In 2013, he was signed to Ultra Music and Sony Entertainment. 

Erix was raised on Long Island, New York. He began performing professionally as a DJ/Emcee at age nine and signed his first management and recording contract as a pop singer at the age of 14 with Louis J. Pearlman, the boyband mogul behind Orlando based Transcontinental Records. Pearlman was later arrested for embezzling 300 million dollars in one of the largest ponzi schemes in US history and also stood accused of molesting several members of the famous groups he managed.

After Pearlman's downfall, Erix signed a record deal with I.D Music in Denmark and Warner/Chappell Music Scandinavia. His early musical efforts with that label found popularity on MySpace which led to an online TV series with the social network called Journey Of A Rock Star. Songs from his album "For Conformity" amassed millions of online streams and received airplay on international media networks such as MTV Japan and MNET South Africa before landing Ian's single, "Confessions Of A Killer" in the top 10 in Asia.

In 2010, Erix entered into a deal with Universal Music Group in Germany but his album release was held up for years when the record company began restructuring and his former A&R and manager, Nik Hafemann, left the label to become a judge on a German reality TV series. During this time, Erix continued to cultivate his presence online and released demo versions of new songs he had been working on such as "Squeaky Clean", a pop-punk satire of Disney Channel stars, as well as "So Scene, So See Through (A Song For Mutts)" which ultimately inspired the name of Erix's fandom and social justice movement, the "Mutt Army". Amidst it's online popularity, Ian was invited to perform the song on MTV UK in a special live session that was recorded for the network in their London studio. Another single from that period, "The Human Race" was featured in Season 3 Episode 19 of the popular TV show 90210 on The CW network in the USA and worldwide on Netflix.
In 2012, Erix begain to appear as a performer and television presenter in numerous countries around the globe at festivals such as Tomorrowland in Belgium and Ultra Music Festival Europe. He began experimenting with more electronic, dance, and pop sounds and had a major breakthrough in 2012 when he played his single, "Sex, Dance and Rock & Roll (Lose It)" onstage at Réveillon, a live New Year's Eve concert in Brazil with David Guetta that had an in-person audience of 2+ million people. Ian was later signed to Ultra Music and since that time he has continued to tour extensively, visiting over 60 countries worldwide. 

In 2014, Ian recorded "Shangri-la" (also known as "Rannalle"), a song he wrote with Finnish boy band TCT and producer Erik Nyholm. The Scandinavian version of the song was nominated for the biggest hit of summer 2014 by radio station The Voice. The song was originally ranked second but it eventually won the vote to be named "Best Song of the Summer". The track climbed to the top of the single charts for several consecutive weeks reaching number 3 on national radio charts. Overall, the song was the fourth most played radio song in Finland in 2014 and on 24 July 2014, it was announced to have sold enough copies to be awarded gold record status. In 2015, Erix released the English language version of "Shangri-La". Ian's video premiered on Vevo in Spring 2015 and features Erix in the hedonistic European party resort of Sunny Beach, Bulgaria. On July 10, 2015, in response to Ian's video, The Guardian, one of the UK's largest newspapers, reported that "music is over because Ian Erix has spoiled it for everyone."
In 2016, Erix released an EP called "Graffiti On My Heart" along with a 4 part music video film linking together his singles "Horse Of A Different Color, "Time Machine", "Out From Under" and "Tomahawk". Each song tells a different story, ranging from pain and loss and a fractured spirit to rebellion, anti-conformity and overcoming adversity. The video series was based on Ian's personal life experiences as a survivor of childhood abuse and the aftermath of the tragic 2013 deaths of both his dad and grandfather, which have been alleged as homicides. 

In 2017, Ian linked up with British boyband Union J to play 17 dates across the UK throughout the month of February He previewed new material from his forthcoming album on that tour and announced his new LP would likely be called "Renegade". After his final date in the UK, Erix embarked on another promo tour that took him to South East Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Europe. In the Philippines he appeared on MTV Asia with fellow pop artist Austin Mahone. He presented and performed at the red carpet pre-show at Justin Bieber's "Purpose Tour" in Mumbai, India on May 10th, 2017.

On his 2017 tour stops, Erix began promoting his latest single, "Footprints In The Sand", an EDM based pop track with lyrics about living life to the fullest which he wrote during a song writing session in Finland. The song began to grow in popularity in several countries throughout the summer months. It broke into the Top 100 on national Japanese pop radio in July 2017 and remained in top 20 on dance radio in Japan throughout the summer, peaking at #5 during the week of August 25th. A David Guetta mashup version of the song was released in Europe and Asia in August. Ian's original version of "Footprints In The Sand" went on to land at #37 on iTunes sales charts in Scandinavia and later claimed #1 chart positions on Spotify in Czech Republic and Latvia. The song cracked the Top 40 national sales and radio charts in Bulgaria peaking at #29. While Ian was on tour in Europe, the song impacted the streaming charts on Spotify in Greece, Cyprus, Iceland, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania and Portugal peaking at # 5 in Cyprus In the United States, the song received airplay on several Top 40 Mediabase, iHeart Radio and Sirius XM Satellite Radio stations. It was voted top new song for 4 weeks in a row on Kiss FM in Memphis landing Ian a permanent spot in the Hall Of Fame as a favorite "newbie" artist for that iHeart radio station.

On the last week of 2017, Erix appeared in the United Arab Emirates as a celebrity ambassador at several events with pop stars such as Katy Perry, Akon and Hardwell to present the Red Diamond Award to the city of Dubai for the World's Greatest New Year's Eve Celebration.

Yellowstone Caldera

The Yellowstone Caldera is a volcanic caldera and supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park in the Western United States. It is sometimes referred to as the Yellowstone Supervolcano. The caldera and most of the park are in the northwest corner of Wyoming. The caldera is about 55 by 72 km. It was formed during the last of the three supereruptions that occurred over the last 2.1 million years.

A caldera is a large cauldron-like hollow that forms shortly after the emptying of a magma chamber in a volcano eruption. It's what is left after the explosion.

Volcanism at Yellowstone is relatively recent. The calderas lie over a hotspot under the Yellowstone Plateau. Light and hot magma (molten rock) from the mantle rises toward the surface. The hotspot is much deeper than the terrain: it is "stationary", while the North American Plate moves west-southwest over it.

Calderas appear to move, but this is an illusion. The plates of the Earth move, and hot spots stay in the same place (see Hawaiian Islands). As the Americas moved west, they ran over one or two hot spots. This is the one now in Wyoming.

Uriel

Uriel (, , , meaning “God is my light” or “fire of God”) is an archangel in Jewish and Christian traditions. The Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Anglicans call him “Saint Uriel the Archangel” or simply “Saint Uriel”.

The Roman Catholic Church only recognizes three archangels which are mentioned in the Bible: Michael, Gabriel and Raphael. But according to the certain rabbinic and Christian traditions, there are four or even seven archangels, Uriel is generally the fourth. In the Deuterocanonical book 2 Esdras, Uriel is sent by God to answer the questions which are asked by Ezra.

The role of Uriel in Christian apocryphal traditions is different from answering Ezra's questions. He is said to have rescued John the Baptist from the Massacre of the Innocents(the murder of all boys under the age of two in the area of Bethlehem) as a child and reunited him and his mother Saint Elizabeth with John's cousin, Jesus. This is shown in Leonardo da Vinci's painting "Virgin of the Rocks."

Uriel is often described as a cherub and the angel of repentance and is the angel at the Gate of Eden. In "The Apocalypse of Peter", Uriel is shown to be as cruel as any demon when enforcing repentance. He is also supposed to be one of the angels that buried Adam and Abel in Eden.

Song rhythm tracks

Song Rhythm Tracks are musician's backing tracks that are composed entirely of percussion and/or drums and arranged for a song. They do not include any harmony or melody parts. They are neither (i) traditional song backing tracks, which include harmonic accompaniment, nor (ii) traditional rhythm tracks, which are not arranged for a song.

Musicians, including singers, use these tracks to support both their practice and performance of popular song. Typical musical genres represented are pop, blues, jazz, folk and Latin, but any genre may be included that uses a constant pulse. The tracks provide higher-quality rhythmic backing due to being arranged for the song the musician plays. This has advantages over traditional (none song-arranged) rhythm tracks because the musical form of the song is followed by the rhythm.

Not only would one person play along with a track, but a few people could join in. If they are lucky, they may just come up with a killer song.

Full song backing tracks provide a fuller arrangement of a song than song rhythm tracks do but they may be limited in the facilities to re-arrange / re-mix the backing track. For instance, there might be instruments included that the musicians wish to remove from the mix. Song Rhythm Tracks can be used as the basis for an arrangement generally without requirements of re-arranging the song rhythm tracks. Full song backing tracks are often used by singers as their sole accompaniment. Song rhythm tracks are used by single, or groups of, musicians that do not have a drummer.

As rhythmic backing does not include harmony, song rhythm tracks are simpler arrangements than full song backing and are arranged to the musical sectional and chorus structure of the song. These arrangements may be comparable to a drummer's accompaniment and can be used as the rhythm tracks in productions without additional arranging.

The term pulmonary fibrosis means scarring of lung tissue and is the cause of worsening dyspnea (shortness of breath). Fibrosis is usually associated with a poor prognosis.

IPF belongs to a large group of more than 200 lung diseases known as interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), characterized by the involvement of lung interstitium.

IPF usually occurs in adults of between 50 and 70 years of age, particularly those with a history of cigarette smoking, and affects more men than women. Treatment to slow down the progression of the disease may include nintedanib or pirfenidone.

Pulmonary fibrosis

Pulmonary fibrosis (literally "scarring of the lungs") is a respiratory disease in which scars are formed in the lung tissues, leading to serious breathing problems. Scar formation, the addition of extra fibrous connective tissue (the process called fibrosis), leads to thickening of the walls, and causes low oxygen supply in the blood.

As a result patients suffer from shortness of breath.

In some patients the cause of the disease can be diagnosed, but in others the cause is unknown, a condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. There is no known cure for the scars and damage in the lung due to pulmonary fibrosis.

Philosophy of mathematics

The philosophy of mathematics is a kind of philosophy that tries to study what mathematics really is. Philosophers of math ask themselves questions like:

None of those questions has a clear answer, so mathematicians are free to choose which answers they like. For example:

Mathematicians who believe in Platonism think that numbers are real, just like rocks and trees. We can't see them, but we can represent them with symbols, and use them to study the world.

Mathematicians who believe in Fictionalism think that math is just made up. Numbers, shapes and other things in math are just ways that we use to make science possible, but they don't really exist.

Mathematicians who believe in Logicism believe that math is true because it is based on true sentences (called axioms). It does not matter if numbers and shapes exist, or not, just that they represent true things.

Mathematicians who believe in Finitism think that everything that makes sense has a beginning and an end. Things like infinity don't exist.

Collapse of Hotel New World

On 15 March 1986, in one of Singapore’s worst civil disasters, the Lian Yak Building (better known as Hotel New World) collapsed. 33 people died and 17 were rescued alive from the rubble.

The Singapore Fire Service (SFS) (present-day Civil Defence Force), the Armed Forces and the police all assisted in the rescue operation. Passers-by and nearby residents also joined in, helping to clear the rubble and pull out survivors. SAF medical officers and MOH doctors present took turns to crawl through narrow spaces inside the rubble to try and provide assistance to trapped survivors, giving glucose and saline drips to them. At first, power saws and drills were used to cut through the rubble and reach survivors; however the use of heavy machinery posed a risk to people trapped under the rubble. 

This led to concern among tunnelling experts from Britain, Ireland and Japan who were involved in nearby construction for the Mass Rapid Transit, which included Thomas Gallagher, Thomas Mulleary, Patrick Gallagher, Michael Prendergast, and Michael Scott; as well as Tan Jin Thong, Deputy Director (Operations) SFS.

They volunteered to dig 4 tunnels under the rubble, which resulted in the rescue of another eight survivors. They later received the Pingat Gagah Perkasa (Conspicuous Gallantry Medal) for their actions.

The investigation found that during the calculation of the building’s structural load, only the LIVE LOAD (weight of people in the building, and additional fixtures and fittings, such as furniture) was factored in. The DEAD LOAD (weight of the building itself) was completely omitted from the calculation. This meant the building was not designed to support its own weight. It was later discovered that an unqualified draftsman, instead of a professional structural engineer, did the calculations for the building. The owner (which died in the collapse) also requested to use inferior materials in construction, in order to reduce the cost.

After the incident, Singapore’s building safety regulations were updated. Since 1989, all structural designs/calculations must not only be prepared by a Professional Engineer, but also counter-checked by an independent Accredited Checker.

Dotted and dotless I

Dotted and dotless "I" are two different letters in the Turkish alphabet. One of them (İ, i) has a dot above it and the other (I, ı) does not. This is true in both the capital and lower case forms of the letters (see the picture).

The dotless I has the sound, while the dotted İ has the sound. To show how they are pronounced, here are two examples:

Some of the other Turkic languages that use the Latin script, like Azerbaijani and Tatar, also use both kinds of I. But in all these languages, including Turkish, the letter "j" does not have a dotted or dotless form, with a dot only on the lower case character (J, j), just like in the Indo-European languages. However, a dotless j, ȷ, does exist in Unicode.

Haloalkane

Haloalkanes are alkanes that contain one or more halogens. A variety of different reactions can form these organic compounds. They cannot quickly be reacted, making them reasonably stable.

There are many kinds of haloalkanes, used for many purposes. Haloalkanes can be primary, secondary, or tertiary and could contain more than one type of halogen. Some haloalkanes contain no hydrogen atoms.

Whether the haloalkane is primary, secondary, or tertiary depends on where the halogen is placed in the molecule. Halogens placed on carbon that is attached to one other carbon atom makes the haloalkane a primary alkane. Halogens placed on carbon that is attached to two other carbon atoms makes the haloalkane a secondary alkane. Halogens placed on carbon that is attached to two other carbon atoms makes the haloalkane a secondary alkane. Halogens placed on carbon that is attached to three other carbon atoms makes the haloalkane a tertiary alkane.

This list includes the official "(de jure)" FIFA club world champions;"" the international official competitions are trophies organized by FIFA or affiliated federations (for FIFA statute).In synthesis FIFA has three types of world champions, those coming from the Copa Rio 1951, the Intercontinental Cup and from the Club World Cup, the three competitions confer the same title, that of FIFA club world champion.""


The football experts agree that the Intercontinental Cup is the most fascinating football competition that ever existed thanks to the great balance in the field given by the lower economic gap of the time and rules on foreign players who gradually favored the European teams and weakened the South American teams; there are many sources and statistics that confirm this.

There are also federations not connected to FIFA (), also for this reason the titles recognized and awarded by FIFA are intended as titles of the federation in question. An officially recognized title, by definition, is official.""

In accordance to what is formally communicated by FIFA, the total count of official world titles is as follows:

Blue raspberry flavor

Blue raspberry is a common flavoring for candy, snacks, syrups and soft drinks. The flavor comes from "Rubus leucodermis", more commonly known as the "whitebark raspberry" or "blue raspberry" for its bluish-black fruit.

Newcomb's paradox

Newcomb's paradox is a thought experiment in philosophy, specifically decision theory. The paradox goes as follows:Imagine a super-intelligent entity known as Omega, and suppose you are confident in its ability to predict your choices. (Maybe Omega is an alien from a planet that's much more technologically advanced than ours.) You know that Omega has often correctly predicted your choices in the past (and has never made an incorrect prediction about your choices), and you also know that Omega has correctly predicted the choices of other people, many of whom are similar to you, in the particular situation about to be described.There are two boxes: A and B. Box A is see-through and contains $1,000. Box B is opaque, and contains either $0 or $1,000,000. You may take both boxes, or only take box B.Omega decides how much money to put into box B. If Omega believes that you will take both boxes, then it will put $0 in box B. If Omega believes that you will only take box B, then it will put $1,000,000 in box B.Omega makes its prediction, puts the money in box B ($0 or $1,000,000), presents the boxes to you, and flies away. Omega does not tell you its prediction, and you do not see how much money Omega put in box B.What do you do?

If Omega is always right, then Omega would only put $1,000,000 in box B when you choose to take only box B. Since $1,000,000 is more preferable than $1,000, only choosing box B makes the most sense and since Omega is always right, then you should choose box B.

Since Omega has already left, the amount of money in box B won't change based on the decision you make. Regardless of what's in box B, you can always get another $1,000 by walking away by both boxes.

Episcopal Church

Danish resistance movement

The Danish Resistance Movement was an underground movement organized to resist the Nazi German occupation of Denmark during World War II. Due to the initially lenient arrangements, in which the Nazi occupation authority allowed the democratic government to stay in power, the resistance movement was slower to develop effective tactics on a wide scale than in some other countries.

By 1943, many Danes were involved in underground activities, ranging from producing illegal publications to spying and sabotage. Major groups included the communist BOPA (Danish: "Borgerlige Partisaner", Civil Partisans) and Holger Danske, both based in Copenhagen. Resistance agents killed an estimated 400 Danish Nazis, informers and collaborators until 1944. After that date, they also killed some German nationals.

After the war the Resistance was supported by politicians within Denmark and there was little effort to closely examine the killings. Studies were made in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and people learned that there was sometimes improvised and contingent decision making about the targets, with some morally ambiguous choices.

Uterine cancer

Uterine cancer, also known as womb cancer, is any type of cancer that starts from the tissue of the uterus. It can refer to several types of cancer, with cervical cancer being the most common type worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries. Endometrial cancer (or cancer of the inner lining of the uterus) is the second most common type, and fourth most common cancer in women from developed countries.

Risk factors depend on specific type, but obesity, older age, and human papillomavirus infection add the greatest risk of developing uterine cancer. 

Early on, there may be no symptoms, but irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or fullness may develop. If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods. When the cancer has extended beyond the uterine tissue, more advanced treatments including combinations of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery may be required.

Cousin marriage

Cousin marriage is marriage between cousins. In some places like the Middle East it is common. In other places it is illegal. A famous cousin marriage is that between Charles Darwin and his wife Emma. 

It is believed that the general laws and customs relating to marriage have been influenced by examples of birth defects. Most societies have some kind of limitation to marriages of the type: the closer the genetic relationship, the more likely it is to be banned.

So, the main argument against cousin marriages is that it increases the likelihood of genetic defects occurring in children of such marriages. The classic example of this is the occurrence of haemophilia (and some other conditions) in the royal families of Europe. The repeated marriages between close relatives increased the chance of recessive genes arriving on both chromosomes of a pair, so causing defects to appear. Of course, pre-scientific societies would not have known this. However, they would have seen the results of continual close marriages, such as the brother-sister matings in the Ancient Egyptian royal lines.

Doki Doki Literature Club!

Doki Doki Literature Club! is a visual novel that was created by Team Salvato. It was released on 22 September 2017 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. On 6 October 2017, it was released for Steam. The story involves a high school student that joins the school's Literature Club and the way the character interacts with its four female members. At first, it looks like a light anime dating simulator, but it soon becomes a psychological horror game. It is a game that breaks the fourth wall very often.

The creator of the game, Dan Salvato, was working on the game for close to two years. Before creating this game, Salvato created modifications, or "mods", to "Super Smash Bros. Melee". At first, "Doki Doki Literature Club!" was released on itch.io then released on Steam. The game is free, but if you pay $10, you can receive the downloadable content. The game got more than one million downloads three months after it was released.

On June 30, 2021, Team Salvato and Serenity Forge released an expanded version of the original game, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!, to Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. The expansion was later released to macOS on August 12, 2021.

"Doki Doki Literature Club!" is a visual novel, so most of the game is the player reading the game's story. Sometimes, the player has to make decisions that change how the story goes.

The game has a poetry minigame where the player chooses certain words. These words correspond to a certain girl. If certain words are picked, different parts of the story can be viewed. The game also makes the player view some of the files that the game uses to play.

The game has a lot of foreshadowing that tells the player certain things about the story. If the player decodes the character files, there are extra stories unlocked. At certain times special files appear in the game files. Text documents show up about the next scenes.

The player's character is invited by his childhood friend, Sayori, to join the Literature Club. He meets the other members of the club. They are Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika. The player begins to get involved in the club and getting to know the girls better. Near the end of the first act, Sayori tells the player that she has depression and loves the player. Sayori soon commits suicide by hanging herself. The game shows a lot of glitches and it restarts.

When the player begins a new game, the game is very close to the first run, but Sayori is missing. If Sayori is mentioned, the game glitches and she appears as a mix of all the other characters' appearances. The player gets involved in the club again and gets closer to either Natsuki or Yuri. Unusual events happen, like only being able to choose Monika's options. Yuri soon stabs herself several times and dies, or Natsuki's neck cracks and she dies. The game glitches again and it restarts again.

With the new game, only Monika is alive. She tells the player that she knows she is in a game and can change the character files. She reveals that she pushed Sayori and Yuri to kill themselves. She continues talking for a long period of time. To stop this, the player has to delete her character file. When this happens, the game glitches again, and restarts.

In the new game, Sayori, Yuri and Natsuki are alive, but Monika is gone. Sayori tells the player that she knows about Monika and how she is in a game. She becomes very obsessive. Monika comes back to delete Sayori and the game glitches. The end credits come and Monika sings a song called "Your Reality".

After the game was released, "Doki Doki Literature Club!" got a very devoted fanbase very quickly. The game got more than one million downloads three months after it was released. One month after that, the game got more than two million downloads.

Many critics said good things about the game. Gita Jackson, a journalist that works for Kotaku said that "Doki Doki Literature Club!" was "a truly special game". She also said that "if you like horror games, especially ones that really get under your skin, please check out "Doki Doki Literature Club"." Tom Philip, who is a journalist for GQ said that the game was "one of the scariest games I have ever played."

"Doki Doki Literature Club!" won a few awards. At the IGN Best of 2017 awards, it won the People's Choice Awards for "Best PC Game", "Best Adventure Game", "Best Story", and "Most Innovative".


Shinjitai

Shinjitai (kanji: 新字体, kana:しんじたい) literally means "new character forms" in Japanese. These are kanji (the Japanese word for Chinese characters) that were simplified in Japan after World War II. At that time the Japanese government changed the writing system by replacing many kyūjitai (kanji: 旧字体, kana: きゅうじたい, meaning: old character forms) by making simpler characters. These newer characters had the exact same meaning and pronunciations as the older ones, but they could be written with fewer strokes of a pen. For example, the character 樂 simplified to 楽. Some shinjitai characters are also used as simplified Chinese characters. For example, the character 国 is used in both Japanese and simplified Chinese. However, most shinjitai look more like traditional Chinese characters (called kyūjitai in Japanese) than even simplified Chinese characters do, and there are also far fewer shinjitai than simplified Chinese characters. While most Japanese words these days use the shinjitai form, there are a few words where writing the kyūjitai form is still common. For example, the word "dragon" is usually written using the shinjitai character 竜, but writing the kyūjitai character 龍 for it is also still quite common. For most kanji, however, the shinjitai form is unchanged from the kyūjitai form.

Gotthard Base Tunnel

The Gotthard Base Tunnel (GBT; , , ) is a railway tunnel in Switzerland. With a route length of , it is the longest tunnel in the world. The link consists of two single-track tunnels connecting Erstfeld (Uri) with Bodio (Ticino) and passing below Sedrun (Graubünden). The main purpose of the Gotthard Base Tunnel is to increase local transport capacity through the Alpine barrier, especially for freight, notably on the Rotterdam–Basel–Genoa corridor, and more specifically to shift freight volumes from trucks to freight trains. This both significantly reduces the danger of fatal road crashes involving trucks, and reduces the environmental damage caused by heavy trucks. The tunnel provides a faster connection between the canton of Ticino and the rest of Switzerland, as well as between northern and southern Europe, cutting the Basel/Zurich–Lugano–Milan journey time for passenger trains by 1 hour (and from Lucerne to Bellinzona by 45 minutes). After 64 percent of Swiss voters accepted the NRLA project in a 1992 referendum, first preparatory and exploratory work began in 1996.

The Ig Nobel Prize is a parody of the Nobel Prize, which is awarded every autumn to celebrate ten unusual or trivial achievements in scientific research. Since 1991, the Ig Nobel Prizes have been awarded to “honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think.” The name of the award, the “Ig Nobel Prize” ( ) is a pun on the word "ignoble", an achievement “characterized by baseness, lowness, or meanness”, and is satirical social criticism that identifies absurd-sounding, yet useful research and knowledge.

Organized by the scientific humor magazine, the "Annals of Improbable Research" (AIR), the Ig Nobel Prizes are presented by Nobel laureates in a ceremony at the Sanders Theater, Harvard University, and are followed by the winners’ public lectures at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Cybercrime

Cybercrime is crime that uses a computer and computer network. There are many types of cybercrimes. These include doxxing, hacking, copyright issues, cyberterrorism and fraud. Many countries have laws against many types of online pornography. Some other actions can also be illegal such as cyberbullying, spying, child grooming or hebephilic behavior. Some governments have agencies that deal with computer crimes.

Cybercrime can include many different types of profit-driven criminal activity, including ransomware attacks, email and internet fraud, and identity fraud, as well as attempts to steal financial accounts, credit card or other payment card information. Cybercriminals may also target an individual's private information, as well as corporate data for theft and resale.

Cybercrime attacks can begin wherever there is digital data, opportunity and motive. Cybercriminals include everyone from the lone user engaged in cyberbullying to state-sponsored actors, like China's intelligence services. Cybercrimes generally do not occur in a vacuum; they are, in many ways, distributed in nature. That is, cybercriminals typically rely on other actors to complete the crime. This is whether it's the creator of malware using the dark web to sell code, the distributor of illegal pharmaceuticals, using cryptocurrency brokers to hold virtual money in escrow or state threat actors relying on technology subcontractors to steal intellectual property (IP).


Magnetic levitation

Magnetic levitation, maglev, or magnetic suspension is a method by which an object is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields. Magnetic force is used to counteract the effects of the gravitational acceleration and any other accelerations.

The two primary issues involved in magnetic levitation are "lifting forces": providing an upward force sufficient to counteract gravity, and "stability": ensuring that the system does not spontaneously slide or flip into a configuration where the lift is neutralized.

The sizes of magnets also has a role in the levitation. While using smaller magnets it is easier to control levitation and experimental conditions.

Magnetic levitation is used for maglev trains, contactless melting, magnetic bearings and for product display purposes.

"Piyaa Albela" is a modern-day telling of the classic love story of Menaka and Vishwamitra. The story is about Naren and Pooja, who are very different from each other. 

The show revolves around Naren Vyas (Akshay Mhatre) and Pooja Goel (Sheen Dass).

Naren is on the path of spirituality, living as a recluse and cut off from worldly activities. Lost in his own world of meditation, he is a concern for his mother Supriya Vyas and father Harish Vyas, who belong to the affluent Vyas family. Pooja, on the other hand, is warm, confident and a complete people's person who can take care of herself and is deeply rooted in family values.

Naren's parents want Pooja to be Naren's caretaker. They ask Pooja to bring Naren back to the mortal, selfish world. Initially thinking Naren to be another rich boy, Pooja finally starts appreciating his genuine selfless nature. Naren and Pooja become best friends, and Pooja falls in love with him after he saves her from being raped by his cousin Rahul. Naren's wedding is fixed with Surbhi Singhania, the daughter of Harish's friend Yash Singhania, while Pooja has agreed to marry Dr. Anand. Naren's cousin Mayank falls in love with Pooja. His love for Pooja turns into an obsession, and he kills Anand on Pooja's wedding day. To save Pooja from humiliation, Naren steps in and marries her, while Surbhi ends up marrying Rahul.

Soon, Naren realizes that he also loves Pooja. Pooja finds out that her horoscope has some problems and feigns insulting Naren and his family so they can separate. Supriya meets with an accident trying to stop Pooja and becomes mentally unstable.

Pooja returns to Naren's life as Mrs. Kapoor. Naren, who was a simple and sober man, has become a ruthless womanizer. Pooja's friend, Mr Kapoor, tries to solve Pooja and Naren's misunderstanding but Rahul misleads Ashish into believing that Pooja has fallen in love with him. Ashish joins hands with Rahul and Surbhi. Naren falls in their trap and proposes marriage to Surbhi. Pooja records Ashish's confession and stops Surbhi and Naren's wedding. A guilt-stricken Naren apologises to Pooja but Ashish comes between and tries to kill Naren. Pooja shoots Ashish and Naren takes the blame. However, Kapoor reaches the court on time and saves Pooja.

Pooja and Naren's wedding preparations begin but Pooja meets with an accident while praying for Supriya's recovery. Supriya recovers and is able to stop Mayank's father Rakesh from attacking Pooja. After her accident, Pooja starts behaving like a child. Her uncle, Satish Gupta takes Pooja with him to their hometown Dehradun. To stop her from being sent to a mental asylum, Naren marries her and starts taking care of her.

It is revealed that Pooja has been feigning her illness to save Naren's grandfather from Kapoor who has been threatening to expose that Naren is not the biological son of Supriya and Harish. Kapoor kidnaps Pooja who finally kills him to protect Kashinath. Planning on ending her act, Pooja's half sister Naina Goel reveals Pooja's secret to Naren instead causing him to become furious with Pooja. Naina sets her eyes on Naren wanting to take revenge on Pooja who she thinks was always preferred by their father.

Naren's health deteriorates as a result of his excessive drinking. Pooja finds out Naren's real mother, Chandrika who is a prostitute. To hide this truth from the Vyas family, Satish and Pooja lie that Pooja is Chandrika's illegitimate daughter while Naina is Satish's legitimate niece. The Vyas family, except for Kashinath, start hating Pooja. Chandrika is allowed to stay with the family in the Vyas Mansion but is blamed for an attack on Supriya. The misunderstanding leads to Pooja and Chandrika leaving the house.

Mayank is dead. Pooja lives in Krishnapuri, a red-light area with Chandrika. Naren is standing for elections and visits Pooja everyday at Krishnapuri. Everyone thinks that Naren does this because he loves Pooja but only Chandrika, the Vyas family and Naren's assistant Danish know that Naren in fact hates Pooja. Pooja continues to fulfil her duty of a wife.

Naren hires a shooter to kill Pooja. On a trip to Dehradun, Naren realises Pooja's trust in him and calls the sharpshooter to call off the attack. Naren and Pooja consummate their marriage. At Naren's election rally, Pooja is shot at and Naren discovers that a woman called the sharpshooter to carry put the attack. He realises Pooja was aware of his initial plan and apologises but Pooja loses all trust in him. However, they team up to expose Naina as the culprit behind causing Supriya's attack and resulting paralysis, framing Chandrika for the attack, killing Mayank, abducting a heavily pregnant Surbhi and planning to kill Rahul and marry Naren.

Kashinath reveals that Naren is Chandrika's son. A heart-broken Naren leaves the Vyas Mansion. At an ashram, Naren and Pooja renew their marital vows. They meet Bela and Praveen, another newly-wed couple. Bela is an introvert while Praveen is an extrovert who often acts silly. Instigated by Rahul, Harish decides to kill Naren but Harsha, Naren's aunt, warns Pooja and Naren. Naren and Praveen meet with an accident and Praveen dies while Naren, needing a heart-transplant, receives Praveen's heart. A strange change appears in Naren's behaviour as he starts behaving like Praveen. It is revealed that Bela is planning to take revenge from Praveen's parents as they insulted her parents for drowny results in Bela's mother's death and her father's blindness. Under Bela's spell, Naren abducts Praveen's parents and Bela kills them but spares Naren for saving her father. Bela, then, surrenders to the police.

Naren's adoptive sister Meghna (Sangeita Chauhan) is blind and is about to marry Kunal Goenka, the man she loves. On their wedding day, Meghna is raped and suspicion falls on Naren as he was absent from the venue. Pooja saves Naren from the accusations. The next suspicion falls on Pooja's cousin Anuj Gupta, Danish, Rahul and Kunal. The real culprit tries to kill Surbhi and Pooja as they discover his real identity. Surbhi loses her child. It is revealed that Rahul's father, Hardik Vyas is the real culprit. Hardik is arrested and Meghna and Kunal are married.

Angraj (Sahil Uppal), Harish and Supriya's biological son, enters the Vyas Mansion. Angraj sets his eyes on Pooja, who he used to eve-tease and harass before her marriage, and starts plotting to kill Naren. On the day of Pooja's birthday, Anuj shoots Angraj trying to save Pooja but Naren shoots Anuj to defend his half brother resulting in both Angraj and Anuj dying causing tension between Naren and Pooja's families.

Angraj is revealed to be alive and gets plastic surgery, and returns with Naren's face and kidnaps the real Naren. Angraj (as Naren) takes Naren's place at home. After an interesting twist in the plot, Supriya herself kills Angraj.

The story ends with Supriya managing Angraj's foundation, Rahul and Surbhi having a baby boy, Anuj's wife Rachel (Sandhya Mehta) marries Rahul's half brother Arjun Vyas (Khushwant Walia), and Pooja gets pregnant with Naren's child.

Cystocele

A cystocele is also called a prolapsed bladder or anterior vaginal wall prolapse. This is a medical condition when a woman's bladder bulges into her vagina. Sometimes it may bulge out through her vagina. Some women may have a cystocele with no symptoms. Some have problems with urination. Other problems may be incontinence (not being able to stop urination). Some women may have repeated urine infections if they have a cystocele. Other parts may also bulge into the vagina.

Women are at risk of having a cystocele if they have given birth, have a hard time with passing stool, have a chronic cough, lift heavy objects, or have had other surgeries of the reproductive organs. Other things which may cause cystocele is a family history of cystocele or being overweight. The reason why the bladder may bulge into the vagina is that the wall of the vagina becomes weak.

Sometimes a cystocele exists but does not cause difficulties. Women who have more serious problems may be treated with a vaginal pessary or surgery. Doing exercises with the pelvic muscles can help. Older women have cystocele more often then younger women.

A woman may have a cystocele if she has:

Cystocele can make sexual intercourse difficult or painful.  Even if cystocele is treated, there is about a 50% chance that it will happen again. If a woman cannot stop the urination, she may be put in a nursing home.

A cystocele happens when muscles and attachments become weak because of childbirth or other causes.  Different parts of the vagina can become weak. Other parts of the reproductive system can bulge out of the body.

Some women have diseases that might cause the bladder to bulge out of the vagina. These diseases are Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

There are many things that increase the chances of having a cystocele. Here are some things which might cause cystocele:

The doctor or nurse will examine the vagina and the bulge. The amount of urine that stays in the bladder and does not come out will be measured. An ultrasound might be used. Another test that might be used is called a a voiding cystourethrogram. Sometimes the woman may have an x-ray.

Cystocele may not be serious enough to make a woman see the doctor. If this is true, things can be done to stop the cystocele from becoming worse:

A woman may choose no treatment for a cystocele that is not serious. A woman may choose surgery for a cystocele that is more serious. If the cystocele is bothersome a doctor might suggest using a pessary (a device placed in the vagina to hold the bladder in place.) 

Cystocele can sometimes be treated:

Many times surgery can repair the cystocele. Many doctors who fix a cystocele are gynecologists.

Surgery to fix a cystocele will depend on many things. Surgery doesn't work 10-50% of the time. In some cases a doctor may use surgical mesh to fix the cystocele.

The doctor who fixes the cystocele may fold the weak tissue and then stitch it back in place.  The woman is usually put to sleep during surgery and the medicine to cause the sleep can be different for each woman. It may take four to six weeks to heal. 

After surgery there may be some problems.

In the US, more than 200,000 surgeries are done to fix reproductive organs bulging out of the vagina. Most of these surgeries are for cystocele. between ages of 70–79 years old. Since the number of women getting older keeps getting larger, the number of women with reproductive organs bulging out of the vagina will increase by 46% by the year 2050.

Tabarnia

Tabarnia ("Tabàrnia" in Catalan) is a suggested name and a satirical political project for a portion of the Catalonian territory, Spain. It was created by the organization "Barcelona is not Catalonia" (AKA "Plataforma por la Autonomía de Barcelona", "Movement for an Autonomous Barcelona") as a satirical response towards the Catalonians separatists. Their main target is to establish up a new region in Spain besides Catalonia with some districts ("Comarcas" or "Comarques") from the provinces of Barcelona and Tarragona. 

Its nomenclature is a neologism created from the provinces' names: Tarragona and Barcelona, and it would span these areas:


Proponents believes the area somewhat corresponds to the historic County of Barcelona, although its extension is considerably different.

On 24th September, 2012; "Barcelona is not Catalonia"'s members approved in a constituent assembly their statutes and a political program in order to get their own autonomy as an Autonomous Community within Spain.

The expression "Tabarnia" was used by the first time in 2015 as a territorial entity that would comprise part of the Catalonian seaside and Barcelona Metropolitan Area as a disagreement towards Catalan Government ("Generalitat Catalana"):

Proponents of Tabarnia demands to segregate themselves from the Catalan separatist movement and reclaims the right of a number of territories near the area of Barcelona and Tarragona to constitute themselves as an Autonomous Community within Spain. In the 2015 and 2017 Catalan regional elections, parties opposed to secession (mainly C's, PSC and PP) received a majority of votes and seats in some of these "comarques" (Tarragonès, Baix Penedès, Garraf and Baix Llobregat) including the city of Tarragona, but excluding the most populated Catalan city: Barcelona. 

They allude to a series of fiscal arguments similar to those of Catalan separatism in regards to Spain, although in last Catalan election, Tarragona province showed more support for separatism than unionism.

In December, 2017 the satirical movement became trending topic in the social networks. Since then, they had been appear in Spanish and international media. According them, "Tabarnia is a historical region that comprised the ancient County of Barcelona, currently part of Tarragona and Barcelona provinces".

The rise of this movement creates tension among the Catalan separatist movement because of argumental contradiction and geostrategic risk using their same arguments for independence word by word. as a result, the catalan separatists contradicts themselves when they uses the "unionist" counter-arguments in order to discredit the Tabarnia movement. The territorial area that Tabarnia would comprise includes geostrategic assets that are fundamental for a viable independent Catalonia. The Port of Barcelona and Barcelona–El Prat Airport, some of the richest industrial sectors fall in fact inside areas that hold a majority of voters in favor of unionism, though in the city of Barcelona the pro-independence won the election.

The fact that Tabarnians are asking to be separated from the Catalonia that wants to be separated from Spain, has been interpreted by some newspapers as a reductio ad absurdum of the nationalistic logic in a XXI century Europe. Many Tabarnians believe that a sustained international media attention to this movement would defeat the catalan independence project by simply following their own arguments instead of opposing them.

An ongoing petition is taking place at Change.org in order to be sent to the Spanish Congress of Deputies to consider the creation of this new autonomous region.

Action camera

An action camera is a small video camera made for sticking to a person while playing sport or traveling on a vehicle. This kind of camera is for used for filming an event in a way that people watching the film feel like they are looking from the eyes of person who are doing activities in the event themselves (first-person perspective). While action camera is made for filming, it can also take pictures. All films and pictures it took will be kept on a tiny card that you can pull them out and watch them later.

Action camera is made to be small and very light, so that a person who wear it does not feel its weight while doing his or her things. And it usually uses wide-angle lens to film as many details around as possible. Inside the camera, there is a battery that lasts long enough for you to film for few hours. Action camera is also made to be stronger than normal video camera, so that it keeps filming even when the wearing person moves at high speed or crashes into something.

Camera sellers usually give you a hard clear plastic box that fits with the camera when you buy it. When they do, you should store the camera in this box every time you are going to film something. This box will have holes, a belt, or a metal rod which you can use for tying it to a person, or screwing it on an object that person wears (usually a helmet). Some kind of these boxes can stop water from coming into it when closed, so you may use them to film under water without breaking the camera as well.

Juyin Sarauta

"Juyin Sarauta ("The Royal Ascendance")" is a 2017 movie. It was directed by Falalu A. Dorayi. It was produced by Balaraba Ramat Yakubu and Ado Ahmad Gidan Dabino MON. It was produced in Nigeria by Ramat Productions Ltd and Dogarai Women Film. The lyrics playback was made by Fati Nijar.

The movie won Best Film in the Nigerian Language Award by Zuma Film Festival 2017 and was also nominated for the Best Actor. The movie comes as a medium of enlightenment, entertainment, information and education in the African continent especially of the South Sahara. The plot, the characterization and the dialogue make the story exciting and educating. The producer, defines her attitude towards her intention as gender activist.

Sarki Yusufu (Ado Ahmad Gidan Dabino MON) is the emir of Jadarwa. His wives, concubines and other slaves get divided in moves to produce the next Emir. In the process, each faction is with a particular prince and that leads to murder, rituals, and confusion reigned in the palace. Jakadiya (Ladidi Fagge) and Uwar Soro (Hauwa Musa) connive to turn Ahmadu mad; Umar, the heir apparent is poisoned by Fulani Gaji (Zainab Muhammad); Bashari is framed for stealing from the Emir and is banished; and Suleimanu is sent away from the palace as a tender boy. At the end, the less privileged among the Princes and son of a concubine, Suleimanu, is the Emir.


In 2015, Balaraba Ramat Yakubu wrote Juyin Sarauta to bring about new ideas on the women status in Northern Nigeria, where culture and religion dominate their rights. She discussed it with some people and conducted research in different areas. Together with staff of Ramat Productions, they came up with idea about role of women in determining the king in Hausaland. According to her,  “...the story is that it shows that women are the real power axis in Hausa society.”

To achieve the primary aim of the project, there was a need for adequate funding and support from development partners like UNICEF, UN Women, UNDP, CEDAW, USAID, DFID and women's organizations. They should support the project morally and financially for the benefit of larger audience in order to safeguard societal values and socio cultural, economic, and political values for women for a better society. She eventually contacted many of them and succeeded in gaining a lot from them. Project Act-Nollywood provided a substantial funding for the startup of the project.

Principal photography began in March 2016, different areas were assessed but the crew could not find a suitable one which could be used to look as far back as 100 years before the coming of colonial masters into Hausaland. The team agreed to build their own city for the purpose of the project. Danhassan town was chosen and a new palace city was build on rented land of about 4 km.

Initially, the director, Falalu A. Dorayi screened and auditioned principal character (Sarki Yusufa) but when he was on camera, he could not perform effectively. Ado Ahmad Gidan Dabino MON was appropriated for the role and plays  perfectly.

The movie took about twenty days from 11th February to 3rd March, 2016. The movie was initially targeted for 10 days, however due to some logistics issues, more days were added. For the purpose of the movie, the crew also borrowed a residence of the district head of Danhassan, changed its exterior design and later restored it back to its previous condition.

Johnson County War

The Johnson County War, also known as the War on Powder River and the Wyoming Range War, was a fight over farmland. It happened in Johnson County, Wyoming between 1889 and 1893. The fights started when cattle companies started ruthlessly punishing accused rustlers in the area. Many of the “rustlers” were actually innocent settlers that competed with the companies for land, livestock and water rights. As tensions swelled between the large established ranchers and the smaller settlers in the state, violence finally reached a peak in Powder River Country, when the ranchers hired armed gunmen to invade the county. The gunmen's initial incursion in the territory aroused the small farmers and ranchers, as well as the state lawmen, and they formed a posse of 200 men that led to a grueling stand-off. The siege ended when the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison relieved the two forces, although further fighting persisted in the following months.

The events have since become a highly mythologized and symbolic story of the Wild West, and over the years variations of the storyline have come to include some of its most famous historical figures. In addition to being one of the most well-known range wars of the American frontier, its themes, especially class warfare, served as a basis for numerous popular novels, films, and television shows in the Western genre.

National League Division Series

In Major League Baseball, the National League Division Series (NLDS), played early to mid October, is a playoff round to determine which two National League teams play in the NLCS. It consists of two best-of-five series featuring three division winners and the winner of the wild card game.

The first Division Series was played in 1981. A strike shortened the MLB season that year. Division winners from the first half took on the second-half division champions. 

The Division Series was implemented for good in 1994. The leagues were expanded two three divisions, and the wild card was also added. However, a strike cancelled the rest of the 1994 MLB season, including the playoffs. The current Division Series thus began play in 1995.

They were the founders of the original McDonald’s restaurant in San Bernardino, California and inventors of the ‘Speedee Service System’. They were born in Manchester, New Hampshire.

In 1954, the McDonald brothers partnered with Ray Kroc. Kroc took 1.9 percent of the gross sales, of which the McDonald brothers got 0.5 percent. The brothers wanted to only have a small number of restaurants, which Kroc did not want them to have. Ray Kroc eventually bought them out.

On November 30, 1984, Richard McDonald – the first cook behind the grill of a McDonald's – was served the ceremonial 50,000,000,000th (50 billionth) McDonald's hamburger by Ed Rensi, then president of McDonald's USA, at the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York City.

Maurice McDonald died from heart failure in Riverside, California, on December 11, 1971, at the age of 69. Richard McDonald died in Manchester, New Hampshire, on July 14, 1998 of a heart attack, at the age of 89.

Inverse element

The inverse element is the opposite of a number or equation. The inverses of formula_1 in addition is formula_2 (called the additive inverse), and formula_3 or formula_4 in multiplication (called the multiplicative inverse, or reciprocal).

In general, given an element "g" in a group "S" equipped with an operation formula_5, an inverse element of "g" is an element "g*" such that formula_6 and formula_7 are both equal to the identity element (of the group). Other examples of inverse include inverse function and matrix inverse.

Khoisan

The Khoisan is the name for two peoples of Southern Africa: the San and the Khoikhoi. The San are foraging bushmen, and the Khoi are a pastoral people previously known as the Hottentots. The relationship between the two groups is not very clear. The San are generally smaller than other humans in the area. They also look very different than other groups of people there. As of 2018, between 90.000 and 100.000 San are left. Most of them live in Botswana and Namibia. There are San minorities in South Africa, Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The San were some of the original (indigenous) inhabitants of Southern Africa. Then the southward Bantu migrations from North and East Africa reached the region 700 years ago. The Bantu populations displaced the Khoi and San to become the predominant inhabitants of Southern Africa.

The Khoisan “was the largest population on Earth at some point”, according to one evolutionary geneticist. The evidence of the Khoisan's original presence in South Africa is the distribution of their languages today. Khoisan language groups often have extreme differences in structure and vocabulary despite close proximity, which demonstrates a long period of settlement and co-evolution of languages in the same region.

Charles Darwin wrote about the Khoisan and sexual selection in "The Descent of Man" in 1882, commenting that their steatopygia evolved through sexual selection in human evolution, and that "the posterior part of the body projects in a most wonderful manner".

In the 1990s, genomic studies of the world's peoples found that the Y chromosome of San men share patterns of polymorphisms that are different from those of all other populations. Because the Y chromosome changes little, this type of DNA test is used to determine when different human subgroups separated from one another. This shows their last common ancestry. The authors of these studies suggest that the San may have been one of the first populations to differentiate from the most recent common ancestor of all living humans, estimated to have lived 60,000 to 90,000 years ago.

Steatopygia

Steatopygia is the state of having substantial levels of fatty tissue on the buttocks and thighs. This can be seen on the buttocks, the inside and outside of the thighs, and the knee.

Steatopygia is an inherited condition of the Khoisan peoples of southern Africa. Charles Darwin wrote about the Khoisan in "The Descent of Man" in 1882, commenting that their steatopygia evolved through sexual selection in human evolution, and that "the posterior part of the body projects in a most wonderful manner".

Luo people

The Luo (also called Joluo or Jonagi/Onagi, singular Jaluo, Jaonagi or Joramogi/Nyikwaramogi, meaning Ramogi's heirs) are an ethnic group in western Kenya, northern Uganda, and in Mara Region in northern Tanzania. They are part of a larger group of the linguistic Luo peoples who inhabit an area ranging from South Sudan, South-Western Ethiopia, Northern and Eastern Uganda, South-Western Kenya and North-Eastern Tanzania.

The Luo are the fourth largest ethnic group (15%) in Kenya, after the Kikuyu (22%), the Kalenjin (18%) and the Luhya (16%). The Luo and the Kikuyu inherited the most of political power in the first years following Kenya's independence in 1963. The Luo population in Kenya was estimated to be 2,185,000 in 1994 and 3.4 million in 2010 according to Govt census.

They are mostly fishermen but in the colonial era,they were pastoralists. They migrated from Bahr-El-Ghazal a sub-tributary of R.Nile and first settled at Pukungu Pakwach in Uganda and later dispersed to Kisumu in Kenya and Tanzania near Lake Victoria.

Their leader was called "Ruoth" meaning chief. There religion these days are Christianity, African Traditional Religion and some are Muslim.

Their god was called Nyasaye whom used to stay at Ramogi Hills. Their initiation used to be done on teen boys who used to get their 6 lower teeth removed,therefore they used to be regarded as men. These days they have stopped the practice and have copied the Kikuyu and circumsise the foreskin.

Tim Sweeney

Tim Sweeney (1929 – 1 January 2018) was an Irish sportsman. He played hurling with his local club Foneagh. He was a member of the Galway senior inter-county team between 1949 and 1963.

He won back-to-back county titles with Fohenagh in 1959 and 1960. He was on the Fohenagh team which lost the 1963 county final to Turloughmore.

Sweeney died at the age of 88 on 1 January 2018.

Persistence hunting

Persistence hunting is important because it is thought to have been important in earlier human societies. It is practiced today by the San people and by the Rarámari (Tarahumara) people of northwest Mexico.

Many animals on grassland move faster than humans. However, humans have endurance and can jog-trot for long distances. Their loss of hair allows them to sweat easily, and their spears give them a way to kill prey at the end of the hunting. 

A group of about four men start out on a search. Finding a suitable antelope, they move towards it, and the animal runs away. They check the signs, such as broken blades of grass, and follow it more slowly, but persistently. Eventually the animal has to stop to eat grass. Grass has so little nutrient that continual eating during the day is essential for their survival. If the antelope runs off into the far distance, one of the younger men is chosen to run after it while the others jog along behind. The runner comes back to say where the animal has gone. In this way younger members with endurance and older men with experience have their roles in the hunt. Eventually the men catch up while the animal can run no further without digesting grass (which is its 'fuel').

There is an alternative explanation as to why the animal eventually stops running, and that relates to its lesser ability to reduce its temperature by sweating, because its coat of fur is so much denser than the human hair covering. This may indeed play a part, but primarily the cause of fatigue is what is called 'metabolic fatigue', such as the shortage of fuel within the muscles.

The San people and their hunting methods were presented on television by David Attenborough in the documentary "The Life of Mammals, Program 10 Food for thought".

Millennium Prize Problems

The Millennium Problems are 7 big math problems that if answered, could bring change all over math and science education, and may even affect technology.

Whoever solves any one of the Millennium Problems could win $1,000,000, as well as potentially other prizes for it, like the Fields Medal, or even the Nobel Prize.

Some of the problems have a relationship to the de Fermat conjecture called Fermat's Last Theorem or FLT. 

As described by the Clay Institute of Massachusetts, the Millennium Problems are:

A 200-year old question that is one of the most famous mathematical problems ever. Solving it will make mathematicians understand a lot more about prime numbers. It has applications in cryptography, number theory, and might even be useful in physics.

Mathematicians want to know when a certain function, called the Riemann Zeta function, written ζ(s), equals zero. There are many well known values of s where ζ(s) is zero, composing the negative even integers. The Riemann Hypothesis says that apart from these, ζ(s) equals zero only when s is a complex number with real part 1/2 or a negative whole number. As to whether this hypothetical is one of pure or applied math, a particular characterization of the machine to measure earthquakes gives real-part-1/2 spikes.
Some numbers have the special property that they cannot be expressed as the product of two smaller numbers, e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. Such numbers are called prime numbers, and they play an important role, both in pure mathematics and its applications. The distribution of such prime numbers among all natural numbers does not follow any regular pattern. However, the German mathematician G.F.B. Riemann (1826 - 1866) observed that the frequency of prime numbers is very closely related to the behavior of an elaborate function

called the Riemann Zeta function. The Riemann hypothesis asserts that all interesting solutions of the equation

lie on a certain vertical straight line.

This has been checked for the first 10,000,000,000,000 solutions. A proof that it is true for every interesting solution would shed light on many of the mysteries surrounding the distribution of prime numbers.

The laws of quantum physics stand to the world of elementary particles in the way that Newton's laws of classical mechanics stand to the macroscopic world. Almost half a century ago, Yang and Mills introduced a remarkable new framework to describe elementary particles using structures that also occur in geometry. Quantum Yang-Mills theory is now the foundation of most of elementary particle theory, and its predictions have been tested at many experimental laboratories, but its mathematical foundation is still unclear. The successful use of Yang-Mills theory to describe the strong interactions of elementary particles depends on a subtle quantum mechanical property called the "mass gap": the quantum particles have positive masses, even though the classical waves travel at the speed of light. This property has been discovered by physicists from experiment and confirmed by computer simulations, but it still has not been understood from a theoretical point of view. Progress in establishing the existence of the Yang-Mills theory and a mass gap will require the introduction of fundamental new ideas both in physics and in mathematics.

This is the most famous one in computer science. It would be solved "if" someone discovered
The metaphor can easily be asked of a pocket calculator: can it always find the solution of a typed equation as easily as it could check multiplication by division, for instance? The heart of the problem is in one-way operators' speed factor.

Suppose that you are organizing housing accommodations for a group of four hundred university students. Space is limited and only one hundred of the students will receive places in the dormitory. To complicate matters, the Dean has provided you with a list of pairs of incompatible students, and requested that no pair from this list appear in your final choice. This is an example of what computer scientists call an NP-problem, since it is easy to check if a given choice of one hundred students proposed by a coworker is satisfactory (i.e., no pair taken from your coworker's list also appears on the list from the Dean's office), however the task of generating such a list from scratch seems to be so hard as to be completely impractical. Indeed, the total number of ways of choosing one hundred students from the four hundred applicants is greater than the number of atoms in the known universe! Thus no future civilization could ever hope to build a supercomputer capable of solving the problem by brute force; that is, by checking every possible combination of 100 students. However, this apparent difficulty may only reflect the lack of ingenuity of your programmer. In fact, one of the outstanding problems in computer science is determining whether questions exist whose answer can be quickly checked, but which require an impossibly long time to solve by any direct procedure. Problems like the one listed above certainly seem to be of this kind, but so far no one has managed to prove that any of them really are so hard as they appear, i.e., that there really is no feasible way to generate an answer with the help of a computer. Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin formulated the P (i.e., easy to find) versus NP (i.e., easy to check) problem independently in 1971.

Perhaps the most important equations in fluid mechanics, which studies liquids and gases— to design better cars and jet airplanes, to learn how the atmosphere and water cycle work, among other things. They are shorthanded in engineering, much used in mathematics, and regarded in applied sciences.

Waves follow our boat as we meander across the lake, and turbulent air currents follow our flight in a modern jet. Mathematicians and physicists believe that an explanation for and the prediction of both the breeze and the turbulence can be found through an understanding of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. Although these equations were written down in the 19th Century, our understanding of them remains minimal. The challenge is to make substantial progress toward a mathematical theory which will unlock the secrets hidden in the Navier-Stokes equations.

In the twentieth century mathematicians discovered powerful ways to investigate the shapes of complicated objects. The basic idea is to ask to what extent we can approximate the shape of a given object by gluing together simple geometric building blocks of increasing dimension. This technique turned out to be so useful that it got generalized in many different ways, eventually leading to powerful tools that enabled mathematicians to make great progress in cataloging the variety of objects they encountered in their investigations. "Unfortunately, the geometric origins of the procedure became obscured in this generalization." In some sense it was necessary to add pieces that did not have any geometric interpretation. The Hodge conjecture asserts that for particularly nice types of spaces called projective algebraic varieties, the pieces called Hodge cycles are actually (rational linear) combinations of geometric pieces called algebraic cycles.

The only Millennium Problem that has been "conditionally" solved, as of 2018. Mathematician Grigori Perelman found it true in certain 4d characterizations of the 3-sphere, but declined the $1M prize.

Because Perelman published his papers over the Internet rather than in a peer-reviewed journal, as required by the Clay Math Institute's rules, he was not initially offered CMI’s award, though representatives for the organization indicated they might relax their requirements in his case. Complicating their decision was uncertainty over whether Perelman would accept the money; he publicly stated that he would not decide until the award was offered to him. Finally, in 2010, CMI offered Perelman the reward for proving the Poincaré conjecture, and Perelman refused.

The Poincaré Conjecture states that the sphere is the only 3D object that can be shrunk to a single point, given certain conditions.

By most schools of natural philosophy, this conjecture would be seen immediately as either obviously correct or obviously flawed. For one thing, it is not irreversible. The 3-sphere characterization, like various Happy End boards/Hademard tilings, has higher dimensional characterization, so the most desired solution would be an equation for y per dimension x.

If we stretch a rubber band around the surface of an apple, then we can shrink it down to a point by moving it slowly, without tearing it and without allowing it to leave the surface. On the other hand, if we imagine that the same rubber band has somehow been stretched in the appropriate direction around a doughnut, then there is no way of shrinking it to a point without breaking either the rubber band or the doughnut. We say the surface of the apple is "simply connected," but that the surface of the doughnut is not. Poincaré, almost a hundred years ago, knew that a two dimensional sphere is essentially characterized by this property of simple connectivity, and asked the corresponding question for the three dimensional sphere. 

This question turned out to be extraordinarily difficult. Nearly a century passed between its formulation in 1904 by Henri Poincaré and its solution by Grigoriy Perelman, announced in preprints posted on ArXiv.org in 2002 and 2003. Perelman's solution was based on Richard Hamilton's theory of Ricci flow, and made use of results on spaces of metrics due to Cheeger, Gromov, and Perelman himself. In these papers Perelman also proved William Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, a special case of which is the Poincaré conjecture. See the press release of March 18, 2010.

Mathematicians have always been fascinated by the problem of describing all solutions in whole numbers x,y,z to algebraic equations like

x² + y² = z²

Euclid gave the complete solution for that equation, but for more complicated equations this becomes extremely difficult. Indeed, in 1970 Yu. V. Matiyasevich showed that Hilbert's tenth problem is unsolvable, i.e., there is no general method for determining when such equations have a solution in whole numbers. But in special cases one can hope to say something. When the solutions are the points of an abelian variety, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture asserts that the size of the group of rational points is related to the behavior of an associated zeta function ζ(s) near the point s=1. In particular this amazing conjecture asserts that if ζ(1) is equal to 0, then there are an infinite number of rational points (solutions), and conversely, if ζ(1) is not equal to 0, then there is only a finite number of such points.

Vladimir Yankilevsky

Vladimir Borisovich Yankilevsky (Russian: Владимир Борисович Янкилевский) (February 15, 1938 — January 4, 2017) was a Russian artist. He was born in Moscow.

Yankilevsky was known mostly for his work in the Soviet Nonconformist Art movement of the 1960s through the 1980s. His most famous works are his triptychs, works that are hard to classify. His works often create a nightmarish imagery to paint a picture of restrictive mental states about daily life in the Soviet Union, and with the human condition in general. 

Yankilevsky was also known for having participated in the Manezh Art Exhibit of 1962, during which Nikita Khrushchev famously chastised the Nonconformist Art Movement as degenerate. 

In the vibrant art scene of 1970s Moscow, he was discorvered by Dina Vierny, a distinguished gallerist and art collector based in Paris. Vierny, after a visit in Moscow in the early 1970’s, committed to supporting artists resisting the constraints of socialist realism and discovered Yankilevskly, among others such as Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov. In the challenging climate of Soviet artistic constraints, Yankilevsky, alongside other non-conformist artists, faced obstacles in expressing their creativity freely. Dina Vierny, recognizing the immense talent and the struggle these artists endured, played a pivotal role in aiding their artistic aspirations. With Vierny's assistance, Yankilevsky made the momentous decision to relocate to Paris, a city renowned for its artistic freedom and diverse creative environment.

In this new chapter of his life, Yankilevsky found himself amidst a community of like-minded artists who, despite diverse styles, shared a common goal—to break free from the confines of state-imposed artistic norms, particularly socialist realism. This relocation not only marked a geographical shift but also symbolized a profound liberation for Yankilevsky and his fellow artists.

The move to Paris facilitated an environment where Yankilevsky could further explore and exhibit his distinctive artistic vision without the constraints imposed by the Soviet regime. Dina Vierny's unwavering support and commitment to the Russian avant-garde artists played a crucial role in fostering a space where their creativity could flourish, contributing to the rich tapestry of artistic expression in the vibrant cultural landscape of Paris. Vierny's commitment culminated in the groundbreaking exhibition "Russian Avant-Garde - Moscow 1973" at her Saint-Germain-des-Prés gallery, showcasing the diverse yet united front of non-conformist artists challenging the artistic norms of their time.

Yankilevsky died in Paris of leukemia on January 4, 2018 at the age of 79.

Ryakuji

Ryakuji (kanji:略字, kana:りゃくじ) are shorthand and usually unofficial forms of kanji. 

For example, 々 is a shorthand form of the kanji 仝, which itself is another form of the kanji 同, which means "same". For compound words where the same kanji is used twice in a row, 々 is used where the second kanji would be so that it doesn't have to be written again. 

For example, the word "tokidoki", which means "from time to time", uses the same kanji for "time" twice, but is written as 時々 instead of 時時 because Japanese would see the second compound as redundant. So 々 implies that the second character is the same as the first.

Other same character compounds include:

This is similar to English ligatures, or letters that combine to make a new letter or symbol such as &, which was a combination of the letters that make the Latin word "et".

His political career has spanned more than fifty years. He was a member of the Bundestag from 1972 until his death in 2023. His fifty-one year career in the Bundestag made him the longest serving member of parliament in the country's history.

Schäuble was the Leader of the Christian Democratic Union and Leader of the Opposition from 1998 to 2000. During his career, he had several government roles such as Head of the Chancellery, Minister of the Interior and Minister of Finance in the governments of Helmut Kohl and Angela Merkel. He was the President of the Bundestag from 2017 to 2021.

Schäuble was born in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1942. He was the son of tax finance advisor and politician Karl Schäuble and Gertrud Göhring. Schäuble studied at the University of Freiburg and the University of Hamburg, graduating in 1966 and 1970 respectively. He began a career in law at the district court of Offenburg in 1978.

In 1969, he married Ingeborg Hensle. They had four children.

His political career began in 1969 as a member of the Junge Union. Schäuble was elected to the Bundestag by winning the constituency seat of Offenburg. His ministerial career began in 1984 when he was appointed Minister for Special Affairs and Head of the German Chancellery by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 

Schäuble was the Minister of the Interior from 1989 to 1991 during the Helmut Kohl government. He was seen as Kohl's protege. During his time as Minister of the Interior, Schäuble was one of the most popular politicians in Germany. He was regularly mentioned as a possible future Chancellor, however he was criticized by civil rights activists for his strict law and order policies.

On 12 October 1990, at the age of 48 and just after reunification, Schäuble was the target of an assassination attempt by Dieter Kaufmann, who fired three shots at him after an election campaign event in Oppenau. Kaufmann injured a bodyguard, and severely injured Schäuble's spinal cord and face. Schäuble was left paralysed from the attack and used a wheelchair ever since.

During his time as Finance Minister in the Merkel government, he was described as "Germany's second most powerful person" after Merkel. He took a hard line towards Southern European countries during the eurozone crisis such as not supporting the International Monetary Fund stance to give Greece more time to fix their deficit issues. He was a supporter of austerity policies and his 2014 budget allowed Germany to take on no new debt for the first time since 1969.

When Federal President Joachim Gauck announced in June 2016 that he would not stand for reelection, Schäuble was seen by German and international media as likely replacement; however the job soon went to Frank-Walter Steinmeier instead.

On 27 September 2017 the CDU/CSU group in the Bundestag announced Schäuble’s nomination as President of the Bundestag and assumed office on 24 October 2017. In October 2021, Schaüble left office as President of the Bundestag and was replaced by Bärbel Bas. He became the Father of the Bundestag shortly afterwards since he was the longest sitting member of the Bundestag at the time.

In May 2010, on his way to Brussels for an emergency meeting at the European Parliament, he was hospitalized for an allergic reaction to a new antibiotic. At the time, Schäuble thought about resigning, however, Chancellor Angela Merkel declined his offer to step down twice during a period of bad health in 2010.

Schäuble died of cancer at the age of 81 on 26 December 2023 in Offenburg, Baden-Württemberg.

Bicycle path

A bicycle path is a way marked for people on bicycles to use. 

Many bicycle path networks can be found in countries such as Denmark or Netherlands, which has had a national system of cycle routes since 1993. These networks may use routes dedicated exclusively to cycle traffic or minor rural roads whose use is otherwise restricted to local motor traffic and agricultural machinery. A safe way to go on a bicycle is when you have a bicycle path. These are made in places where bicycle safety is given consideration, so you do not have to cycle in busy traffic on dangerous roads.

The Dutch word "Fietspad" means Bicycle Path in English. In the Netherlands you can go on the bicycle path to the shops, housing, stations, schools, and workplaces. 
The more sensible approach is based on efforts to increase Utility cycling. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany the high levels of utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle.

During the 2nd century the Yenisei Kyrgyz were part of the Xiongnu (Huns), Tiele, Rouran, and Xianbei. Later between the 5 - 10 c, the Yenisei Kyrgyz were part of the Göktürk and Uyghur Khaganates.

In 840, the Kyrgyz allied with the Tang dynasty to defeat the Uyghur Khaganate (Mongolia). The Kyrgyz qaghan (king) killed the Uyghur qaghan and rescued Princess Taihe. They moved to Jeti-su and spread south to the Tian Shan mountains and Xinjiang. The Kyrgyz then lived peacefully around Central Asia and Xinjiang, as vassals to the Tang.

The "Tanghuiyao" (8–10 c) called them "Tsze-gu" (Kirgut) and "Xiajiasi". According to Tang records Xiajia could mean "yellow head and red face". That's what the Uyghurs called the Kyrgyz. Their tamga (tribe symbol) is identical to the modern day Kyrgyz tamga.

In the 10 - 12 c, the Kara-Khanid and then Western Liao invaded the area. In the 13th century the Mongol Empire unified everybody. Genghis Khan's first son Jochi occupied Kyrgyzstan.

They were part of the Chagatai Khanate and ruled by other Turkic people. In 1685 the Oirat (Dzungar, Mongolic) ruled them.

Russia then took over, Modern Kyrgyzstan declared independence in 1991.

By the 16th century they lived in Siberia, Xinjiang, Tian Shan, Pamir-Alay, Middle Asia, Urals, Kazakhstan, etc. In China, the term Kyrgyz also refers to the oldest Turkic tribes that lived there (the Tiele and Yeniseian Kyrgyz).

Genetic shows that Kyrgyz have mostly East Eurasian. In Tajikstan, East Eurasian ancestry is one half to two-thirds.

During the Tang Dynasty, they were described with "red hair and green eyes", while those with dark hair and dark eyes descended from the Chinese.

The Kyrgyz were fair-skinned, green- or blue-eyed and red-haired people with East Asian features.

Nowadays Kyrgyz are mostly Muslims of the Hanafi Sunni school. But they were originally shamanist. Arab traders travelled along the Silk Road and arrived by the 8th century. But the Kyrgyz were not immediately converted. The Persian text "Hudud al-'alam", said that the Kyrgyz "venerate the Fire and burn the dead".

Islam spread during the Mongol empire and following Chagatai Khanate. By the 18th century the Kyrgyz were converted by the Khanate of Kokand (a vassal of the Qing dynasty). Some Kyrgyz-Chinese practice Tibetan Buddhism.

The Kyrgyz-Chinese are one of the 56 ethnic groups of China. There are more than 145,000 Kyrgyz livinng in China. They are known as "Kē'ěrkèzī zú" (). They live mainly in Xinjiang.

In the 19th century, the Russians conquered Kyrgyz land and drove many to China. The Kyrgyz had a better life in China than in Russia. The Russians fought against the Muslim nomadic Kyrgyz. But because there were so many Chinese-Kyrgyz, the Russians stopped because they did not want to fight against the Chinese. The Muslim Kyrgyz were sure that in any upcoming conflict, China would defeat Russia.

Some are called the "Fuyu Kyrgyz". They are Yenisei Kirghiz (Khakas people) people. In the 17th c, the Dzungar khanate moved them from the Yenisei river to Dzungaria. In the 18th c, the Qing dynasty then defeated Dzungaria and moved them to Manchuria. They now live in Wujiazi Village, Fuyu County, Heilongjiang. Their language is related to the Khakas language (the Fuyü Gïrgïs dialect).

They speak a Turkic language. It used to be written in Turkic old script. In Kyrgyzstan, it is written with the Cyrillic alphabet. In China, Pakistan and Afghanistan it is written with an Arabic script. President Atambaev of Kyrgyzstan said switching from Cyrillic to Latin (like Kazakhstan had) may hurt communication with Kyrgyz people in Russia. A different dialect of Kyrgyz called the Pamiri Kyrgyz dialect is spoken by the Kyrgyz people in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They call it "Kara Kyrgyz".

Kyrgyz language

Kyrgyz language is the official language of Kyrgyzstan and a branch of Turkic languages that most Kyrgyz people speak with. Kyrgyz is written with the Cyrillic alphabet, but can be written in the Arabic alphabet in Xinjiang, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

Wagyu beef

Wagyu beef is the beef that comes from the Japanese Wagyu cattle. It is very expensive and regarded as one of the best slices of beef. There is a lot of marbling in the meat, which means that there are streaks of fat within the red meat which makes the meat tenderer and moister, while adding flavor. Sometimes the Wagyu beef is called different things based on where it is from. Some examples include Kobe beef, Matsusaka beef, or Omi beef.

Wagyu has a rigorous authentication process. A user can authenticate the wagyu through the Japanese carcass verification bureau website. A user will be able to determine whether the Wagyu beef on their plate is genuine using the 10-digit cattle ID number on the certificate. 

There are 9 prefectures that raise Wagyu cattle, Miyazaki Prefecture, Hokkaido, Kagoshima Prefecture, Shiga Prefecture, Miyagi Prefecture, Gifu Prefecture, Kumamoto Prefecture, Hyogo Prefecture, and Kagawa Prefecture.

Cattle were brought to Japan from China at the same time as the cultivation of rice, in about the second century AD, in the Yayoi period. Until about the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, they were used only as draught animals, in agriculture, forestry, mining and for transport, and as a source of fertilizer. Milk consumption was unknown, and – for cultural and religious reasons – meat was not eaten. Cattle were highly prized and valuable, too expensive for a poor farmer to buy.

Japan was effectively isolated from the rest of the world from 1635 until 1854; there was no possibility of the intromission of foreign genes to the cattle population during this time. Between 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration, and 1887, some foreign cattle were imported. At first, there was little interest in cross-breeding these with the native stock, but from about 1900, it became widespread. It was ceased abruptly in 1910 when it was realized that, while the cross-breeds might be larger and have better dairy qualities, their working capacity and meat quality was lower. From 1919, the various heterogeneous regional populations that resulted from this brief period of cross-breeding were registered and selected as "Improved Japanese Cattle". Four separate strains were characterised, based mainly on which type of foreign cattle had most influenced the hybrids, and were recognised as individual breeds in 1944. They are collectively known as wagyū, and are:


In 1997, though, Japan declared the Wagyu breed a living national treasure and placed a ban on exports.

The Australian Wagyu Association is the largest breed association outside Japan. Both fullblood and Wagyu-cross cattle are farmed in Australia for domestic and overseas markets, including Taiwan, China, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the U.K., France, Germany, Denmark and the U.S. Australian Wagyu cattle are grain fed for the last 300–500 days of production. Wagyu bred in Western Australia's Margaret River region often have red wine added to their feed as well.

In the United States, some Japanese Wagyu cattle are cross-bred with American Angus stock. Meat from this cross-breed is marketed as "American-Style Kobe Beef", or "Wangus", although many American retailers simply (inaccurately) refer to it as Wagyu. Wagyu were first competitively exhibited at the National Western Stock Show in 2012. Other U.S. Wagyu breeders have full-blooded animals directly descended from original Japanese bloodlines, that are registered through the American Wagyu Association.

Wagyu cattle farming in Canada appeared after 1991 when the Canadian Wagyu Association was formed. Wagyu style cattle and farms in Canada are found in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Canadian Wagyu beef products are exported to the US (including Hawaii), Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.

In 2008, a herd of Wagyu cattle was imported to North Yorkshire, first becoming available for consumption in 2011. Since 2011 there have been Wagyu herds in Scotland.

The Wagyu Breeders Association Ltd was established in July 2014.

The term "Kobe steak" originated among the foreigners who first came and settled in Kobe, from the Meiji period (1868–1912) onwards, after Kobe became the first port in Japan to be opened to foreign trade from January 1, 1869 . From there, news of the meat quickly spread west. 

Kobe beef is considered by experts to be the world's best beef and is very expensive. That is why the term "kobe beef" is also used a lot for marketing purposes. Much of the meat offered under this designation in the West is not real Kobe beef, but is still sold as if it were real. It is therefore not enough that the animal is of the Wagyū cattle breed. It must also be bred from genuine Tajima cattle in Tajima, where all animals are genetically tested and the carcass is classified according to a standard after slaughter. Animals that meet the standard are authorized as Kobe beef and are stamped in four places with the special logo, after which a "Kobe Beef Certificate of Authenticity" is issued for each slaughter. All Kobe beef can therefore be traced from the Kobe Beef website, via a unique 10-digit code that must be found on the packaging. This unique code is assigned to selected animals at defined breeders while they are still calves. The logo a stylistic Japanese chrysanthemum , not the same but similar to the coat of arms of Japan and the Japanese Imperial Seal (which is the same).

Misandry can include violence or discrimination against men. Many misandrists are prejudiced against men. For example they may think that all men or boys are potential rapists.

Gender differences in crime

Gender differences in crime are differences between females and males as criminals or as the victims of crime. Studies of this subject may be in the areas of criminology (study of criminal behavior), sociobiology and women's studies.

According to statistics, males commit more crimes than females. But females do sometimes commit crimes matching those of men, such as bank robbery, murder and burglary.

A 2008 study of domestic violence shows that women have different reasons from men when committing violence against their partner. Women are more likely to do this because they are afraid or to defend themselves. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to be trying to be in control. Men are more likely to beat up, choke or strangle their partner. Women were more likely to slap, kick, bite, throw something at their partner, punch their partners or hit with objects.

Bank robbery
