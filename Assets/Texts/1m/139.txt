Ignatius Sancho was an African born around 1729 on a slave ship. Towards the end of his extraordinary life, he became a British citizen and was eligible to vote in the parliamentary election of 1774, and then again in 1780.

The details of his early life are not certain. He was born on a slave ship crossing the Atlantic. The ship went to the Spanish colonies in Central America. His parents did not survive long, and he became orphaned. His owner took him to London, and he eventually came to live with John Montague, 2nd Duke of Montagu and Mary, Duchess of Montagu. Sancho worked as her butler until her death in 1751.

While living at Montague House in Blackheath, he educated himself. He enjoyed music, poetry, reading, and writing.

During the 1760s Sancho married a West Indian woman, Anne Osborne. He became a devoted husband and father. They had seven children. Around the time their third child was born, Sancho became a valet to George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu (of the second creation), the son-in-law of his earlier patron. He remained there until 1773.

In 1768 Thomas Gainsborough painted a portrait of Sancho at the same time as the Duchess of Montagu sat for her portrait by the artist.

Functionalism

Functionalism may refer to:


Roadkill

Roadkill is any animal that has died on a road because it was hit by a vehicle, for example a deer hit by a car. Vehicles pulled by animals, for example mule carts, did make roadkill, but there was much more roadkill after the invention of the automobile.

In the United States alone, one to two million large animals are killed as roadkill every year and many more small animals.

Most roadkill is caused by cars or trucks.

If the car hits a large animal, for example a deer or elk, it is likely to be damaged. In the United States alone, crashes with deer cause $3.6 billion in damage to cars and other vehicles, 200 deaths each year and many injuries.

Some roadkilled animals are sent to landfills with other garbage, but other bodies are used for scientific experiments, turned into makeup or turned into food for other animals. Some people cook and eat roadkill. Other people make the fur into clothes or other useful things. Some scientists have studied roadkill to see where invasive species have come.

In Alaska, all roadkill belongs to the state. Officers collect the roadkill, bring it to butchers, and bring the meat to charities. In other parts of the United States and in other countries, individual people can get permission to collect roadkill in different ways.

Many governments put up road signs such as "deer crossing" or "panther crossing" signs to tell drivers that there may be animals nearby. Some build fences around roads where cars drive at high speeds. However, then the animals try to cross at the ends of the fences, and they are hit by cars in those places.

Planning new roads so that wild animals can go over or under them from the start is another very good way to prevent roadkill.

Some governments have built wildlife bridges over or underpasses under roads that were already there. In 2009, the local Department of Transportation built fences leading to four culverts on U.S. highway 27, and there were suddenly no roadkilled turtles.

Selectorate theory

Selectorate Theory is a political theory that attributes the actions of leaders to rational, calculated decisions based on acquiring and maintaining power, originally proposed by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita.

Originally proposed in 1993 as a part of a work titled "The Logic of Political Survival", co-written by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Alastair Smith, Randolph M. Siverson, and James D. Morrow, published by MIT Press. It discusses the selectorate theory of politics. Their theory was refined into a 2011 publication titled "The Dictator's Handbook." The main thesis of the book is the implications of selectorate theory and how to improve world and national politics based on its principles.

The theory is based on a single idea: No political leader has ever had total control of their government. Leaders need the support of at least some people to lead, because those people either do something for the leader or tell other people what to do. This means that there is a group of people the leader needs to persuade in order to obtain or keep power. These people are the selectorate, and are divided into three categories:

There are three groups of people that a leader, or their contenders, must remain aware of in order to keep, or acquire, power:


There are many ways that a leader and the selectorate interact with each other, mostly through the five rules that leaders follow to acquire and keep power.


There are two methods of governance that form using the Selectorate Theory: a government with few Essentials- called a small coalition- and a government with a large group of Essentials- called a large coalition.

Small coalition governments are autocracies such as North Korea or the Soviet Union. Although many people can vote in their elections, if there are any, a leader stays in power because of the very few people who are rewarded for their loyalty. In small coalition governments, a leader can simply bribe their Essentials with material rewards such as money or real estate.

Large coalition governments are governments that force leaders to appeal to large amounts of people to take power, such as through an election. This style of governance makes it implausible to bribe individual voters or Essentials, meaning a leader instead pools the money earned from taxes to create policy that disproportionately rewards their Essentials more than other groups.

With the basic idea of how a leader and their selectorate interact with each other, there are several ways that this manifests in domestic and foreign policy.

Monarchy is a system where a regent has a small court of lords whom support the ruler. However, those who are eligible to become a member of the court is also small. This means a contender can easily promise big rewards for those who are able to become members of the court who aren't already, while those in the court must always prepare to be replaced, meaning they are never as loyal as they could be.

As such, democracy and autocracy are more stable systems for a leader because these systems allow them to follow the Second Rule: keep the Nominal selectorate as large as possible.

Foreign aid with no strings attached, such as the giving of money from a wealthy nation to a less fortunate one, often acts as a symbiotic relationship between dictators and democrats. Large-coalition governments send foreign aid money to impoverished nations as a policy concession- thus retaining power- while the impoverished nations, who are often governed by small coalitions, distribute the money among the coalition instead of benefiting the people.

U Škripcu

U Škripcu (; trans. "In Dire Straits") was a Serbian and Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade.

The band was created in 1980 by Zoran Vulović "Vule" (keyboards), Milan Delčić "Delča" (vocals) and Aleksandar Vasiljević "Vasa" (guitar), who later added Miloš Obrenović (drums) and Aleksandar Lukić (bass guitar) to the band, and to change the name of the band to U Škripcu. After the band became successful and popular around Yugoslavia with the release of the album "O je!" and EP "Nove godine!", they failed to repeat this success, and so they disbanded in 1985.

In 1986, Vulović and Delčić re-created the band, but the latter soon left the band, so the new lineup, which included the vocalist Aleksandar Tabaš and various musicians, recorded the fourth studio album, "U Škripcu". The album was not successful, so the band disbanded again in 1988. The next year, Vulović reunited with Delčić and Vasiljević, Lukić on guitar, bassist Dejan Škopelja, and drummer Ratko Ljubičić. They recorded the fifth studio album "Izgleda da mi smo sami". After this, the band disbanded again. After this, Vulović became a producer and manager, Delčić pursued a solo career with his band Sklekovi, and Vasiljević and Lukić became a part of the supergroup Familija. In 2007, the original lineup came back together at the Delča i Sklekovi concert at the Belgrade Dom Omladine, which was released in 2008 as "Ljubilarnih 20 i nešto godina - Live", under the moniker Delča a i U Škripcu. Delčić died of cancer on 24 July 2011.

Plasticity (physics)

Plasticity, or plastic deformation, is the ability of a solid material to have a permanent change in shape. In physics and materials science, this is called deformation. 

For example, a solid piece of metal being bent or pounded into a new shape shows plasticity. Permanent changes occur in the material itself. In engineering, the transition from elastic behaviour to plastic behaviour is known as yielding.

Donald Trump photo op at St. John's Church

On June 1, 2020, amid the George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C., law enforcement officers used tear gas and other riot control tactics to forcefully clear peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square.

This was done to create a path for President Donald Trump and senior administration officials to walk from the White House to St. John's Episcopal Church. Trump held up a Bible and posed for a photo shoot in front of Ashburton House (the church's parish house), which had been damaged by a fire during protests the night before.

Former military leaders, current religious leaders, and elected officials from both parties criticized Trump for the event. The event was described by "The New York Times" as "a burst of violence unlike any seen in the shadow of the White House in generations" and possibly one of the defining moments of the Trump presidency. Joe Biden and some newspapers said that Donald Trump held the Bible upside down, which is not true.

Jitsi

Jitsi is a group of free and open-source voice (VoIP), videoconferencing and instant messaging for many platforms, like the web platform, Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS and Android. The Jitsi project started with Jitsi Desktop (previously known as SIP Communicator). With the growth of WebRTC, the Jitsi team decided to focus on Jitsi Videobridge for doing web-based video calling for multiple people. Later the team added Jitsi Meet, a full video conferencing application that includes web, Android, and iOS clients. Jitsi also operates meet.jit.si, a version of Jitsi Meet hosted by Jitsi for free to be used by the community. Other projects are: Jigasi, lib-jitsi-meet, Jidesha, and Jitsi.

Jitsi is supportefd by various institutions such as the NLnet Foundation, the University of Strasbourg and the Region of Alsace and it has participated multiple times on Google Summer of Code program.

Work on Jitsi (then SIP Communicator) started in 2003as a student project by Emil Ivov at the University of Strasbourg. It was released as an example video phone in the JAIN-SIP stack and later became an independent project.

In 2009, Emil Ivov founded the BlueJimp company which has employed some of Jitsi's main contributors in order to offer professional support and development services related to the project.

In 2011, after successfully adding support for audio and video communication over XMPP's Jingle extensions, the project was renamed to Jitsi since it was no longer "a SIP only Communicator". This name originates from the Bulgarian "жици" (wires).

Jitsi introduced the Videobridge in 2013 to support video calling with multiple people using a new Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) architecture. Later that year initial support was added to the JitsiVideobridge allowing WebRTC calling from the browser. To demonstrate how JitsiVideobridge could be used as a production service, BlueJimp offered a free use of its hosted system at meet.jit.si.

On November 4, 2014, "Jitsi + Ostel" scored 6 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's secure messaging scorecard. They lost a point because there has not been a recent independent code check by people outside jitsi .

On February 1, 2015, Hristo Terezov, Ingo Bauersachs and the rest of the team released version 2.6 from their stand at the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting 2015 event in Brussels. This release includes security fixes, removes support of the deprecated MSN protocol, along with SSLv3 in XMPP. Among other improvements, the OS X version has aa Java 8 runtime inside, enables echo cancelling by default, and uses the CoreAudio subsystem. The Linux build fixes font issues with the GTK+ native LookAndFeel, and fixes someissues about microphone volume level on call starting when using the PulseAudio sound system. A full list of changes is available on the project web site.

Atlassian bought BlueJimp on April 5, 2015. After that, the new Jitsi team under Atlassian stopped important new development work on the Jitsi Desktop project and expanded its efforts on projects related to the Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet. Regular contributions from the open source community have maintained the Jitsi Desktop project. Jitsi is fully funded by 8x8.

The Jitsi open source repository on GitHub currently contains 103 repositories. The major projects include:


Jitsi Meet is an open source JavaScript WebRTC application and can be used for videoconferencing. One can share presentations and with just a link can invite new members for videoconference. It can be used by downloading the app or directly in a browser and is compatible with any recent browser. Every user can use Jitsi.org servers or can download and install the server software on a Linux-based machine.

Lithium beryllide

Lithium beryllide is a hypothetical intermetallic compound of lithium and beryllium. It may have many possible compositions. They include LiBe, LiBe, LiBe, LiBe, LiBe, LiBe, LiBe, LiBe and LiBe.

Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide

Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) s a hydrophilic salt. Its chemical formula is LiCFNOS. It is commonly used as a source of lithium ions in electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries. It is an alternative to the commonly used lithium hexafluorophosphate. It is made up of one lithium cation and a bistriflimide anion. LiTFSI is toxic if swallowed. It is toxic in contact with skin and can cause severe skin burns. Therefore, sealed batteries must not be opened. 

Waterfall frog

The waterfall frog or torrent tree frog ("Ranoidea nannotis") is a frog from Australia. Scientists have seen it between 180 and 1300 metres above sea level.

The adult male frog is 3.2 to 5.2 cm long and the adult female frog is 4.8 to 5.9 cm long. This frog lives in fast-flowing streams in rainforests and other forests. It does not only lay its eggs in fast streams. It spends most of its time in or near the water. The adult frog is gray or olive on the back with mottling colors and a white belly. This frog can lay eggs at any time of year. The female frog lays her eggs underneath rocks. The tadpoles have strong tails for swimming and mouths on the underside of their bodies so they can hold onto rocks. Adult frogs hide in the stream or near waterfalls during the day and look for food at night. They usually do not go more than 35 metres away from the water.

This frog eats almost any animal without bones inside that it can fit into its mouth. It will eat flies, dragonflies, beetles, true bugs, mites, bees, wasps, ants, insect larvae and millipedes.

This frog is endangered. Scientists think this might be because feral pigs brought to Australia by humans rip up their streams, but they are not sure. Some scientists looked at whether habitat loss or or chemicals that humans use to kill insects might be killing the frogs, and they found this is probably not what is killing them. Some scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could be killing the frogs

Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide

Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide is a lithiated organosilicon compound. Its chemical formula is LiN(SiMe). It is commonly abbreviated as LiHMDS which means lithium hexamethyldisilazide. It is mainly used as a strong non-nucleophilic base and as a ligand.

It can be made by the deprotonation of bis(trimethylsilyl)amine with n-butyllithium. Once its made, the compound can be purified by sublimation or distillation.

It is often used in organic chemistry as a strong non-nucleophilic base. It can be used to make many organolithium compounds, including acetylides or lithium enolates.

Gympie gympie

Dendrocnide moroides, the gympie gympie, or gympie stinger, is a plant of rainforest areas in the north east of Australia. It is also found in Indonesia. It has stinging hairs over the whole plant. It delivers a strong neurotoxin when touched. The small bulb on the tip of the stinging hairs break off and penetrating the skin, injecting the toxin. It is the most toxic of the Australian stinging trees. The fruit can be eaten if the stinging hairs that cover it are removed.

Ernie Rider, who was slapped in the face and torso with the foliage in 1963, said:

For two or three days the pain was almost unbearable; I couldn’t work or sleep, then it was pretty bad pain for another fortnight or so. The stinging persisted for two years and recurred every time I had a cold shower. ... There's nothing to rival it; it's ten times worse than anything else.

The sting does not stop several small marsupial species (such as the red-legged pademelon, some insects, such as "Prasyptera mastersi", and some birds, from eating the leaves.

About the Mystery of the Letters

About the Mystery of the Letters (, "Peri tou mystēriou tōn grammatōn") is a work about the names and forms of letters of the Greek and Hebrew letters. The author of the work is unknown, but he probably had a Christian background. It was probably written in the 6th century Byzantine Palaestina Prima.

The text is known from three Greek manuscript copies written between the 14th and 16th centuries, and one Coptic–Arabic bilingual translation from the late 14th century. The first modern edition of the Coptic text was published in 1900/1901. The Greek text was first described in 1931, but published for the first time only in 2007.

The text was originally written in Palaestina Prima. It was written in the Greek language. The Coptic manuscripts names its author as "Apa Seba" (Arabic: "Saba"), referring to Saint Sabas of Palestine (439–532). Evidence from the text itself leads to a somewhat later dating: in the second half of the 6th century. It could have been written by a follower of Sabas, possibly a monk in the monastery of Mar Saba. This monastery had been founded by Sabas. A certain anti-philosophical polemic tendency expressed by the text can be related to the Origenist controversies of the mid-6th century, in which Mar Saba had played an important role.

The unknown author declares he was prompted to the study of the secret meanings of the letters by the words of the Apocalypse, "I am the Alpha and Omega", and that he then received a vision about them on Mount Sinai.

The author proposes a re-modelled Greek alphabet reduced to 22 letters on the model of the 22 letters of Hebrew (leaving out Xi Ξ and Psi Ψ), and with the Hebrew letter names. He then interprets these letters as symbolic figures of 22 works of divine creation in the biblical Creation according to Genesis, and of 22 corresponding works of salvation by Christ. He shows this theory through descriptions of the various letters and interpretations of their shapes. This is followed by an account of the history of the alphabet, which weaves together elements of Greek mythology and the Hebrew Bible as well as several Jewish and pagan texts: according to this account, the Hebrew alphabet was first handed down to mankind by divine inspiration during the generation of Enoch, but was lost during the Confusion of Tongues. God then revealed the Greek alphabet on a tablet of stone, which, after the Deluge, was brought to Phoenicia and Greece by Cadmos.

A long section of the text is devoted especially to the letter Waw and its Greek equivalent, Digamma (called "Episemon" in the treatise), the numeral sign for "6". This sign is interpreted as a special symbol of Christ. This idea is further connected to the interpretation of all three extra-alphabetic numeral signs of Greek ("Episemon" for 6, Koppa for 90, and Sampi for 900) as symbols of the Holy Trinity, i.e. Christ, the Holy Ghost and God the Father respectively later in the text.

The final chapters of the text are speculations about more general topics, including the history of mankind – whose key events are related symbolically to the sequence of vowels and consonants in the alphabet –, a discussion of Christology dealing with issues related to the Council of Chalcedon, and reflections upon the name of "Adam".


St. Lawrence Island

St. Lawrence Island is an island found in the Bering Sea, west of the U.S. State Alaska. The island has an area of 4,640 square kilometers, and is 140 km long, and 35 km wide. The island is part of Alaska, although it is closer to Russia. The island is a one of the last above water parts of the ancient landmass known as Beringia. It is the sixth largest island in the United States, and is the 113th largest island in the world. In 2010, 1,292 people lived on the island, most of which live in the two main villages of Savoonga and Gambell. 

The island is thought to have been home to several old natives, mostly by the Siberian Yupik around 2,500 years ago. 

In 1878, a famine hit the island, causing over 1,000 people to die, and many others to leave.

During the Cold War, a P2V Neptune by the US Navy were shot down by the Soviet with two fighter planes, forcing it to fly down to Gambell Airport, where the plane crashed. None of the 11 onboard were killed, but 7 were injured.

The island has two main airports, one at Gambell and another at Savoonga. There is another old airport at the east end of the island, which used to be a part of an old military base. The island can be travelled to by boat as well. 

Economic growth

Economic growth occurs when the labor force increases the amount of the goods or services it has. This is through the population working harder or a technological advancement.

Forests of Azerbaijan

The forests of Azerbaijan have 150 endemic species of trees and bushes out of a total of 435 species of trees and bushes.

The total forest area of Azerbaijan is 1,021,880 ha or 11.8% of the country's area. The forest biomes are made up of temperate deciduous forests, temperate mixed deciduous and coniferous forests, temperate coniferous forests and riparian forests. Specialists estimate that in the 8th-9th centuries the forest cover was around 30-35%, most of it is in mountainous areas.

While as a whole, Azerbaijan is a country with modest forest cover, the forest cover is unevenly spread across the country. In the low-lying areas, the forest cover is very sparse, also due to the fact that the precipitation is too low for trees and forests to grow in most of these areas; whereas in many mountainous areas, the forest cover is much greater especially in wetter areas.

49% of the country's forests are located in the Greater Caucasus Mountains, 34% in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, 15% in the Talysh Mountains-Lankaran Lowland region, 2% in the Kur-Araz Lowland, and 0.5% in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.

The forests are classified into two major ecoregions in Azerbaijan: the Caucasus mixed forests of the Greater Caucasus Mountains and the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, and the Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests of the Talysh Mountains-Lankaran Lowland region.

Azerbaijan has many endemic tree and shrub species, relicts of the Tertiary period which were not affected by Pliocene and Pleistocene glaciations.

Bluey (dog)

Bluey (7 June 1910 – 14 November 1939) was an Australian Cattle Dog. Bluey's owners were Les and Esma Hall from Rochester, Victoria, Australia. "Guinness World Records" says that Bluey is the oldest known dog. Bluey lived for 29 years and 5 months.

Another dog named Chilla was said to have lived for 32 years. A study was done to see if Australian Cattle Dogs lived longer than other dog breeds. 100 dogs were surveyed. The study showed that Australian Cattle Dogs lived on average for 13.41 years, almost a year longer than other dog breeds. In the end, the study says that Bluey and Chilla should be seen as distinct from other dogs instead of showing longer lives for Australian Cattle Dogs.

Four pests campaign

The Four Pests Campaign () was one of the campaigns of China, against four pests: namely rats, flies, mosquitoes and sparrows. It was part of a campaign called the Great Leap Forward, which wanted to boost Chinese economy, in the mid-20th century. The campaign started in 1958. 

The extermination of sparrows is also known as Smash Sparrows Campaign () or Eliminate Sparrows Campaign (). It caused severe ecological imbalance; it was one of the causes of the Great Chinese Famine. 

Mao had been told that sparrows ate grain (amongst other things), which was true. But they also ate locusts. And locusts ate nothing but grain. The cause of the famine which followed was that, without sparrows, locusts multiplied hugely and ate so much grain that a great famine followed in China.

In 1960. Mao Zedong ended the campaign against sparrows and redirected the fourth focus to bed bugs. Only after Mao died, in 1976, did the official Chinese press agency announce that sparrows were more useful than harmful. The government took measures to increase the sparrow population in the province of Shandong.

Christmas elf

A Christmas elf is a diminutive elf that lives with Santa Claus at the North Pole and serves as his helper. Christmas elves are often said to wear green or red clad with large, pointy ears and pointy hats. Santa's elves are known to make the toys in Santa's workshop and take care of his reindeer, among other tasks.

The Christmas elf appeared in literature as early as 1850 when Louisa May Alcott completed, but never published a book entitled "Christmas Elves". The image of the elves in the workshop was popularized by "Godey's Lady's Book", with a front cover illustration for its 1873 Christmas Issue showing Santa surrounded by toys and elves with the caption, "Here we have an idea of the preparations that are made to supply the young folks with toys at Christmas time." During this time, Godey's was immensely influential to the birth of Christmas traditions, having shown the first widely circulated picture of a modern Christmas tree on the front cover of its 1850 Christmas issue. Additional recognition was given in Austin Thompson's 1876 work "The House of Santa Claus, a Christmas Fairy Show for Sunday Schools".

The elves are generally said to live for hundreds, or even thousands, of years, despite the fact that in some cases they appear eternally youthful as children.

Carbonatite

Carbonatite () is a type of igneous rock. It has greater than 50% carbonate minerals. Carbonatites may be confused with marble, so may need geochemical analysis to make sure.

Cryogenics

In physics, cryogenics is the production and behaviour of materials at very low temperatures.

It is not well defined at what point on the temperature scale refrigeration ends and cryogenics begins. A gas may be cryogenic if it can be liquefied at or below . 

The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology considers cryogenics as involving temperatures below . The normal boiling points of helium, hydrogen, neon, nitrogen, oxygen, and normal air are below −180 °C. 

The Freon refrigerants, hydrocarbons, and other common refrigerants have boiling points above −180 °C.

Discovery of superconducting materials has raised interest in reliable, low cost methods of producing high temperature cryogenic refrigeration. The term "high temperature cryogenic" means temperatures from above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, , up to .

Cryogenicists use the Kelvin or Rankine temperature scale, both of which measure from absolute zero, rather than more usual scales such as Celsius which measures from the freezing point of water at sea level or Fahrenheit with its zero at an arbitrary temperature.

Body cavity

Many animals have spaces or compartments in their body. These spaces or compartments are called body cavity. They are there for organs, or other structures. Sometimes, there is a space between two organs. This space is known as potential body cavity. Potential body cavities usually contain fluid. In the human body, there is a large body cavity on the side of the belly, and another on the side of the back. The one on the side of the belly is called ventral body cavity, the one on the back dorsal body cavity.
The membranes that surround the central nervous system organs (the brain and the spinal cord, in the cranial and spinal cavities are the three meninges. The differently lined spaces contain different types of fluid. In the meninges for example the fluid is cerebrospinal fluid; in the abdominal cavity the fluid contained in the peritoneum is a serous fluid.

In amniotes and some invertebrates the peritoneum lines their largest body cavity called the coelom.

A password manager is a computer program that stores passwords, and shows the passwords that are put or made in the password manager. They are used to make passwords and store passwords. This is usually used to store multiple passwords as a person may forget some passwords. People store many passwords for different services as it is not safe to only use one password as if someone else knows the passwords of one of their items, they know the passwords of their other things too since they all have the same password. Recently they have been used to stored other things such as credit card numbers, security questions, One-Time Passwords, and account recovery questions. To access the items in the password manager the person usually has to remember one password, if they lose this password, then they will usually not be able to access the data in their password manager.

Narrow fringed frog

The narrow fringed frog ("Ranoidea nudidigita") is a frog from Victoria and New South Wales. It lives on the flat lands not far from the ocean.

This frog is 2.5 to 4.0 cm long. It is bright green, dark green or brown. Adult frogs can change color. It has a black and gold stripe down its side. It lives in streams and lays eggs in small pools next to the stream. Tadpoles swim in the stream and eat algae from rocks. Scientists used to think it was the same species as "Litoria phyllochroa", which is also called leaf green tree frog, but they now think it is its own species. They think so because the "Ranoidea nudidigita" has a different voice call and lives in different places than "Litoria phyllochroa".

Emperor Go-Daigo

Emperor Go-Daigo or Go-daigo Tennō (1288-1339) was the emperor of Japan from 1318 to 1339. He was the 96th emperor of Japan. When he lived, the shoguns had a lot of power in Japan. Emperor Go-Diago tried to take power from them so he could rule Japan.

When Go-Daigo lived, Japan had two governments. There was one government set up by the emperors of Japan, who lived in Kyoto. There was another government run by the shoguns, the "bakufu". The law said the emperors were rulers, but the bakufu had more power than they did. Neither the emperor's government nor the shogun's government was powerful enough to rule very well.

Go-Daigo was born with the name Takaharu on November 26, 1288. He was born on Mount Yoshino, near the town of Yoshino in Nara.

Go-Daigo became emperor in 1318 when he was 30 years old. This was not usual for the time. Usually, small boys were made emperor. When they became adult men, they went to religious communities for men, where they would set up a government and rule even though they stayed in the monastery. A new boy from the imperial family was put on the throne. This system, with a boy on the throne in public and a "former" emperor ruling from a monastery, was called cloistered rule or "insei".

Go-Daigo wanted to rule Japan himself. The bakufu government was weak because they had not been able to reward their warriors. When the Mongols invaded, the bakufu brought an army and kept them from invading. But the usual way to reward warriors was to give them the defeated enemy's lands and treasure. Because the Mongols were invaders, they had no lands for the shoguns to give to their warriors. This made the warriors unhappy with the shoguns. Go-Daigo began to quietly raise an army to defeat the bakufu and take control of Japan, but he was found out. The shogun caught him and imprisoned him on the Oki Islands.

Go-Daigo's supporters fought for him while he was on the Oki Islands. One of the shogun's generals, Ashikaga Takauji changed sides. Go-Daigo's side won, and Go-Daigo ruled. His rule is called the Kemmu Restoration.

Go-Daigo did not reward Ashikaga Takauji with a high rank, only the rank of counsellor. He did not reward many of his other supporters either. In 1335, Takauji declared himself shogun and rebelled. Takauji and his army captured Kyoto and set up one of Go-Daigo's relatives as an emperor there. Go-Daigo ran away from Kyoto and set up a court Yoshino, south of Nara. Go-Daigo's court only ruled the land nearby. So for many years, there were two men who said they were emperor of Japan.

After Go-Daigo's time as ruler, the line of emperor was split in two, one northern and one southern. They were made one line again in 1392.

King Kong Lives

King Kong Lives also known as "King Kong 2" in other countries, is a 1986 American action-adventure fantasy monster movie directed by John Guillermin, and starring Brian Kerwin and Linda Hamilton. It was released in December 19, 1986. It is the sixth King Kong movie, as well as the sequel of the 1976 movie.

After being shot down from the World Trade Center, Kong is revealed to be still alive and is kept in a coma for about 10 years at the Atlantic Institute, under the care of surgeon Dr. Amy Franklin. In order to save Kong's life, Dr. Franklin must perform a heart transplant and give Kong a computer-monitored artificial heart. However, he has lost so much blood that a blood transfusion is badly needed, but Franklin says there is no species of ape or other animal whose blood type matches Kong's.

Hank "Mitch" Mitchell, adventurer and Franklin's eventual lover, who travels to Borneo (as he theorizes that Borneo and the island from the first movie were once part of the same landmass) and captures a giant female ape who is named "Lady Kong". Mitchell brings her to the institute to use her blood for King Kong's surgery. The transfusion and the heart transplant are a success, but Kong escapes along with Lady Kong.

Archie Nevitt, an insane army lieutenant colonel, is called in with his men to hunt down and kill the two apes. Lady Kong is captured alive by Nevitt's troops and imprisoned; Kong falls from a cliff and is presumed dead. However, as Franklin and Mitchell soon discover, Kong's artificial heart is beginning to fail, forcing them to attempt a jailbreak. They discover that Lady Kong is pregnant with Kong's offspring. The jailbreak is successful thanks to Kong, who has survived the fall and breaks his mate out. After being followed, attacked, and shot by the military, Kong kills Lt. Col Nevitt and dies slowly near a military base on a farm where Lady Kong gives birth to an infant son. Kong reaches out to touch his son just before dying. Having returned to Borneo, Lady Kong lives peacefully with her son in the jungle.


"King Kong Lives" was criticized by movie critics and the reviews were very negative. Rotten Tomatoes reported that none of the movie critics gave the movie a positive review, which has an average rating of only 2.20 out of 10. On Metacritic, the movie has an average score of 32 out of 100 based on 9 reviews by movie critics, meaning "generally unfavorable reviews".

Across the world, "King Kong Lives" was a commercial success at the box office, with a total revenue of $48.9 million, which was much more than the movie budget of $18 million.

It was a box office bomb in the United States and Canada, grossing $4,711,220 during its theatrical run. But the movie's success elsewhere, covered the losses in North America.

Leaf green tree frog

The leaf green tree frog ("Ranoidea phyllochroa") is a frog from Victoria and New South Wales in Australia.

This frog lives in forests and grasslands, but it can also live in suburbs and cities. This frog lives near streams. The female lays eggs on plants underneath the water. The tadpoles grow into frogs in 12 weeks.

Even though it is called the "leaf green" tree frog, it is usually olive green in color. It has a yellow stripe down each side of its body. This frog can change color, becoming very dark, to blend in with the area around it to hide.

Scientists used to think the narrow fringed frog was the same species as the leaf green tree frog but they now think they are two species. They think so because the narrow fringed frog and leaf green tree frog have different voice calls and live in different places. The narrow fringed frog is also called the leaf green tree frog or leaf green river tree frog.

Streptokinase

Streptokinase (STK) is a medication used to dissolve blood clots (thrombolysis) in human body. Streptokinase is used mainly treat heart attacks (Myocardia Infarction).

Mountain mist frog

The mountain mist frog, Henrietta Creek tree frog or Nyakala frog ("Ranoidea nyakalensis") is a frog from Australia. It lives in Queensland between 380 and 1020 metres above sea level.

This frog lives in and near streams where the water flowed so fast that it turned white. Scientists saw the adult frogs sitting on rocks or leaves near the streams.

The tadpoles live in the fast water. Scientists wrote that they had strong tails for swimming and bodies meant for the water to flow over them. Sometimes they would dig into the sand to hold on during floods. The tadpoles would spend the winter in mountain streams and grow into frogs in the spring.

This frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists last saw the adult frog and tadpoles in 1990. They saw them in the Carbine Tableland.

Scientists think pigs that escaped from humans might be one reason why the frog is endangered. The pigs rip up the streams where the frog would live. They also think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might be killing these frogs. Scientists also thought habitat loss, human beings building roads and farms where the frog would live, was killing the frogs, but the Australian government protected the frogs' home in 1988.

The animal is only found on the Hispaniola. Their habitat is usually moist forests that are not disturbed by human activities. They are usually found below 1,000 m (3,300 ft). They are sometimes found at higher altitudes or near developed agricultural land.

Hispaniolan solenodons mainly eats arthropods. It also eats worms, snails, mice and small reptiles. It may also eat a small amount of fruit, grains, and leaf litter.

Hispaniolan solenodons are nocturnal. During the day, they stay in their burrows, in trees, caves, or hide. Their burrows may have lots of chambers and tunnels. Adult male and female usually live together with six young ones.

It breeds throughout the year. It has a gestation period of over 84 days. It gives birth to one to three young ones. Usually, if it gives birth to three only two will survive, because the female only has two teats. The young ones are born blind with no hair. The young ones weigh 40 to 55 g (1.4 to 1.9 oz). For two months, they are carried around by the mother. No one knows how long it takes for them to be weaned. They can live for over eleven years in captivity.

The Hispaniolan solenodon is an endangered species because of habitat loss and predation by introduced species. Its numbers have decreased during the last few decades.

The species is protected by law. However, national parks in both Haiti and the Dominican Republic are threatened by deforestation, using the land for farming and charcoal production. The US Agency for International Development and the Nature Conservancy are working with local nongovernmental organisations to make the protection for these parks better.

Nephrotic syndrome

Nephrotic syndrome is the medical term used to describe a collection of signs and symptoms. They occur because of kidney damage. This is different from nephritic syndrome where there are red blood cells in urine, giving it a red colour appearance. 

Nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed by doctors based on the classical symptoms of oedema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidaemia (which is explained below).


Causes can be divided into two as primary and secondary causes.

Primary causes are conditions developing within the kidney.


Secondary causes affect other body parts in addition to kidneys.


Treatment is with drugs that will reduce the damage to the kidneys. Prednisone, Cyclophosphamide, levamisole are some drugs used to treat nephrotic syndrome. 

In addition to that lack of albumin is treated by giving albumin from outside into a vein. Fluid retention is treated with drugs called "diuretics" which will remove excessive water collected in the body. The person is advised to consume salt, fat containing foods and fluids including water in low amounts.

Prognosis is the medical term for the likely outcome of a disease. Good prognosis means the person will have a good outcome with no organ damage and no long lasting effects due to the disease.

Nephrotic syndrome in children usually has a good prognosis. However in children less than 5 years old and in adults over 30 years the prognosis is usually not good and can lead to permanent kidney damage. In these groups the disease will reappear after some time and need continuous drug treatment to keep the disease under control.

Western water-holding frog

The western water-holding frog is a frog from Australia. Scientists are not sure whether it should be called "Ranoidea occidentalis" or "Cyclorana occidentalis". It lives in Western Australia.

The adult male frog is 6.0 cm long and the adult female frog is 7.0 cm long. It has a flat body. The frog lives in places where the ground is dry. It has webbed feet and spends much of its time in the water. Because it has such a wide head, scientist think this frog eats other frogs. They think it eats them when they come to lay eggs in the same temporary bodies of water where the western water-holding frog lays its eggs.

This frog has young when it rains. The female lays eggs in bodies of water that dry up quickly, 500 at a time.

The tadpoles are 8.0 cm long. Once they become young frogs, they are 3.5 cm long.

2020 Brazil wildfires

The 2020 Brazil wildfires were a group of wildfires that began burning Brazil's rainforests in June and continued into September. More than 12% of all the plants in the Pantanal rainforest had burned by August.

In June, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) said its satellites had taken pictures of 2,248 fires. In June 2019, there had been 1,880 fires.

It is normal for there to be some fires in the rainforest. Some are caused by lightning. But experts say most of the 2020 wildfires were set by humans. Satellite photos of the new fires show most of them started along roads leading into land belonging to indigenous peoples who live in Brazil.

Environmental scientists say that a time with very dry weather made the fires worse. In 2020, Brazil saw its worst drought in 50 years. Other experts say the COVID-19 pandemic also made the fires worse because government agencies were too busy to fight the fires.

Firefighter Alexandre Pereira who works in Mato Grosso do Sur said over 95% of the fires in his state had been started by people.

Environmentalist Carlos Rittl from Germany's Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies blamed Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who encouraged people to start fires. He also weakened IBAMA, Brazil's environmental agency, so it could not fight fires or punish people who started fires.

Bolsonaro said the indigenous peoples started the fires, but photographs taken from craft orbiting the Earth show that the fires did not start on indigenous land. Bolsonaro has said he wants people to be able to start farms and mines on land that the law says belongs to the indigenous Brazilians.

These fires are bad for the indigenous people in Brazil because they burn up the food that they would eat. The smoke from fires in some areas is flowing into other areas, harming people's health.

Vapor pressure

Vapor pressure is the pressure applied by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases at a given temperature in a closed system. The vapor pressure shows how fast a liquid evaporates. A substance with a high vapor pressure at normal temperatures is often called a volatile. As the temperature of a liquid increases, the kinetic energy of its molecules also increases. As the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, the number of molecules changing into a vapor also increases, so it increases the vapor pressure.

Manorial Lordship of Caldecote

Manorial Lordship of Caldecote or Lord of Manor of Caldecote is the ownership title of Caldecote Manor and its land, located in Newport, Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. It was introduced after the Norman Invasion. Urian Brereton was the first person to acquire this title. Paul G. Guppy holds the legal rights of the title as per the contract drawn up between him and the Manorial Counsel Limited on October 13, 2016, in compliance with the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 (Hatton Solicitors).

Note..not to be confused with the Lordship of Caldicote, held by Michael Lindsay Orr.

Before the Battle of Hastings, Norman Invasion in 1066, Caldecote was Edeva the Fair. After the Norman Invasion, in 1085, William the Conqueror ordered the commission of the Domesday Book. It was published in 1086 and divided the English counties into 13,418 manors under the governance of Lord of Manor. During this time, Caldecote was under the ownership of Bishop of Chester. The Caldecote Manor was transferred to Herbert Ruffus of Walsall in 1166 and was then passed to William Rufus. It then descended through Margaret, William’s daughter.

King Henry I granted the Lordship of Houghton Regis and Domesday manors to Dunstable Priory, the Priory Church of St Peter. King John supported the decision, and it resulted in an attack on gallows of the Priory at Eddesuthe by Eudo la Zouche, Lord of Cantelou. The Lords also broke open the Priory’s jail at Caldecote.

Manorial Lordship is not part of the British Honours system and is not a title of nobility as per the modern British honours system. It is related to property ownership only. It is an ownership title that can be transferred, conveyed, and even sold. This title is inheritable by the Lord or Lady’s child after their demise. The title is also referred to as the incorporeal hereditament as per the law.

Fishkeeping

Fishkeeping is a popular hobby, done by aquarists. It is concerned with keeping fish in a home aquarium or garden pond. Fish have been raised as food in pools and ponds for thousands of years.

Fishkeeping can be divided into three disciplines, depending on the type of water the fish came from. They are freshwater, brackish, and saltwater fishkeeping.

Freshwater fishkeeping is the most popular type of fishkeeping. Small pet stores often sell many types of freshwater fish such as goldfish, guppies, and angelfish. Many fishkeepers create freshwater aquascapes where there are lots of aquatic plants as well as fish.

Marine aquaria is a type of fishkeeping that is not very popular. This is because saltwater fish have more specific needs to keep them alive. Saltwater fish is also expensive. Many types of saltwater fish are kept in saltwater fishkeeping.

Brackish water aquaria is a type of fishkeeping. The salinity in a brackish-water aquarium must stay between the salinity of freshwater and seawater. Many types of fish prefer brackish water including some types of mollies, many types of gobies, some types of pufferfish, monos, and scats.

Peppered tree frog

The peppered tree frog or Black Creek tree frog, speckled leaf tree frog or speckled tree frog ("Ranoidea piperata") is a frog from Australia. Scientists saw it on the New England Tableland in New South Wales. Scientists have seen it between 800 and 1120 metres above sea level.

This frog is in danger of dying out. It might already be extinct. Scientists have not seen this frog for sure since 1973. Some scientists saw and heard a frog that looked like the peppered tree frog in the 1990s, but their voices sounded different. In the 1990s, scientists decided that they needed to study the genes and DNA of this frog and its relatives before they could truly say which were separate species and which were not. Its relatives are "Ranoidea barringtonensis", "Ranoidea pearsoniana", and "Ranoidea phyllochroa".

Scientists are not sure why this frog is dying out. Many of the streams where it used to live have been changed by human beings who wanted to graze animals there. These streams also have invasive species, for example the mosquitofish, which eats tadpoles.

Sunbird

Sunbirds and spiderhunters make up the family Nectariniidae. They are small, slender passerines from the Old World, usually with downward-curved bills. Many are brightly coloured, with iridescent feathers, especially the males. Many species have long tail feathers. They live mainly in equatorial regions. There are 145 species in 16 genera. 

Most sunbirds feed largely on nectar, but will also eat insects and spiders, especially when feeding their young. Long narrow flowers are punctured at the base near the nectaries, where the birds get the nectar. Fruit is also often part of their diet. 

The sunbirds have similarities with two distantly related groups: the hummingbirds of the Americas and the honeyeaters of Australia. The resemblances are due to convergent evolution. They all have a similar nectar-feeding lifestyle. Some sunbird species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but they usually perch to feed.

Cradleboard

When children are infants, they need to be carried around a lot. Indigenous cultures in North America and throughout northern Scandinavia have come up with a structure they called Cradleboard. Cradleboards are baby-carriers that protect the baby. In Cheyenne, a cradleboard is called pâhoešestôtse or ☃☃, in Skolt Sami it is called ǩiõtkâmpâhoešestôtse or ǩiõtkâm. There are different styles of cradleboard; each culture has its own style or styles. Some communities still use cradleboards. 

Cradleboards are used for the first few months of an infant's life. At that time, babies are carried around a lot, and a portable baby-carrier is a great help. Some cradleboards are woven, as with the Apache. Woven cradleboards are made of willow, dogwood, tule, or cattail fibres. Wooden cradleboards are made by the Iroquois and Penobscot. Navajo cradleboards are made with a Ponderosa pine frame with buckskin laces looped through the frame.

Cradleboards are built with a broad, firm protective frame for the infant's spine. A footrest is located at the bottom of the cradleboard. A cradleboard also has a rounded cover over the infant's head that is similar to a canopy or a modern-day baby carriage hood. The purpose of this headpiece is to provide shade for the infant, since it could be covered with an animal skin, or a blanket in winter to protect against the elements in colder climates. The headpiece also provides extra head protection in case anything bumps against the cradleboard. Ornaments and sacred amulets are often attached to the headpiece as well, for example "beaded umbilical cord cases, and dream catchers or medicine wheels", to amuse and help the infant develop his or her eyesight.

The inside of the cradleboard is padded with a lining of fresh plant fibres, such as sphagnum moss, cattail down, or shredded bark from juniper or cliffrose. The lining serves as a disposable diaper, although the Navajo could clean and reuse the lining made of shredded juniper or cliffrose bark. These plant fibres have antiseptic properties, they keep the infant's skin healthy. The Chippewa tradition was to make a lining for the cradleboard usually from moss growing in cranberry marshes. Before it is used, the moss is smoked over a fire to kill insects; afterwards it is rubbed and pulled to soften it. In cold weather, the infant's feet may be wrapped in rabbit skin with the fur facing inward. The moss lining is surrounded by a birch bark tray insert placed into the cradleboard, which could be removed for cleaning.

Cradleboards have been used in cultures ranging from the sub-Arctic regions of present-day Canada, down to Mexico and Central America. In Arctic regions, cold weather does not make a cradleboard feasible for the infant's survival, and infants are carried in a sling worn under the mother's parka. Cradleboards were widely used by indigenous people across present-day North America. Cradleboards are used by the Kickapoo people in Mexico and were used by Aztecs and the Seri people and Mayan communities as far south as Belize. In present-day South America, most indigenous cultures used slings or pouches, sometimes called a "rebozo", rather than cradleboards. Cradleboards were used in the southernmost part of the continent, in the Patagonia region.

Cradleboards were used during periods when the infant's mother had to travel or otherwise be mobile for work, and needed to protect the infant. The cradleboard could be carried on the mother's back, using support from "tumplines", or "burden straps" that would wrap around her forehead, chest or shoulders; if she carried a pack as well as the cradleboard, the pack strap would go around her chest and the cradleboard strap would go around her forehead. The cradleboard can also be stood up against a large tree or rock if the infant is small, or hung from a pole (as inside an Iroquois longhouse), or even hung from a sturdy tree branch. They were also used when longer travel was required, as the cradleboard could be attached to a horse for transportation.

In the southwest United States and northern Mexico, among cultures such as the Hopi and Apache, infants would spend most of their day and night in the cradleboard. When they got older, infants were taken out of it more and more, for up to five times per day. When the infant reaches the age when it can sit up unsupported, it is then gradually weaned from the use of the cradleboard, and spends less time in it. At this time, the infant may use a second, larger cradleboard that replaces the first. By the time the infant is a year old and begins to walk, they are generally finished with cradleboard use.

Cradleboard use and its effect on mother-infant interaction has been studied in Navajo communities. It has been shown that cradleboard use has no significant negative effect on this development. In the first few months of infancy, cradleboards have a soothing effect on babies. After six months of age or more, infants begin to resist being placed in cradleboards more vigorously as they become more mobile, and they are often placed in the cradleboard with their arms and hands free, so that they can play with objects hung from the cradleboard for their amusement.

Cradleboard use has been associated with increased incidence of developmental dysplasia of the hip. The technique requires straightening the legs, which encourages dislocation of the femur and malformation of the acetabulum. This can be avoided by placing padding between the baby's legs to keep the knees slightly bent with the hips angled outwards. Some modern cradleboard users say that the small 1968 study of Navajo babies was intentionally designed to denigrate a traditional cultural practice.

Westlink M7

The Westlink M7 Motorway or Westlink M7 – formerly Western Sydney Orbital – is one of Sydney's urban motorways and a part of the Sydney Orbital Network. It is a tolled motorway that is owned and operated by NorthWestern Roads Group (NWR) and connects three motorways: M5 South Western Motorway at Prestons, M4 Western Motorway at Eastern Creek and M2 Hills Motorway at Baulkham Hills. It opened on 16 December 2005, eight months ahead of schedule.

Western Sydney is the fastest growing part of the Sydney metropolitan area. The Ring Road 5 and State Route 55 – and later State Route 77 – originally meant to bypass Sydney, had instead become primary arteries for the western suburbs.

By the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century Western Sydney had become the third biggest producer of Australia's GDP, after the Sydney CBD and Melbourne. The growth of industrial and residential areas brought about a massive increase in traffic on its local roads. This led to the planning of the Western Sydney Orbital which, among its original purposes, was to serve the stillborn second international airport at Badgerys Creek.

In January 2001 the federal government made a commitment to progressively contribute A$356 million to the M7 project, with the remaining A$1.5 billion required for the design and construction provided by the private sector. The NSW Minister for Planning authorised the undertaking in February 2002.

The M7 Motorway was privately funded through an innovative construction contract method known as a "deed" to facilitate the expedition of the tendering phase; several deeds were drawn up based on the contractors proposals. The deed was for the full design, construction, operation and maintenance of the motorway including more than 40 kilometres (25 mi) of continuously reinforced concrete (CRCP) and asphalt roads, upgrading of local roads, the longest free-flowing (no toll booths) toll road in the world at the time. More than 90 bridges (of four different types) and the largest shared path network in the southern hemisphere. The design, construct, operate and maintain contract worth at least A$2.0 billion was awarded to WSO (Western Sydney Orbital Pty Ltd) by the Roads & Traffic Authority. The design and construct portion of the contract valued at A$1.8 billion was awarded to a joint venture between Abigroup and Leighton Contractors (ALJV) with design work undertaken by a further joint venture by Maunsell AECOM and SMEC (Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation) with further subcontracting to other designers (Arup) and independent verification by Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM).

The motorway was opened to traffic in 2005. WSO (commonly known as Westlink) operate the motorway with maintenance subcontracted to Westlink Services and tolling to ROAM. With its opening, Metroad 7 between Liverpool and Beecroft was transferred from Cumberland Highway to Westlink M7. Westlink M7 was the first Sydney motorway to be marked with an alphanumeric shield rather than the hexagonal Metroad shield.

On 25 December 2005, just 9 days after opening, the M7 suffered its first fatality: a 12-year-old boy died at Cecil Park when the four-wheel drive he was travelling in rolled down an embankment and onto Elizabeth Drive, almost crushing another car.

Light Horse Interchange
The M7 originates at the Roden Cutler Interchange, a Y-junction with the M31 Hume Motorway and M5 South Western Motorway at Prestons, and weaves to the west of Liverpool to the junction of Elizabeth Road and Wallgrove Road in Abbotsbury. From then on it runs parallel to Wallgrove Road north towards the Great Western Highway and the Light Horse interchange, a stack junction with the M4. Continuing north, it leads to Minchinbury and follows alongside Rooty Hill Road up to Dean Park at an exit with Rooty Hill Road North and Richmond Road.

From this junction the M7 turns eastward along the preserved Castlereagh Freeway corridor through Quakers Hill and Kings Langley up to the interchange with Old Windsor Road to Norwest Business Park and continues southeast to reconcile with the existing M2 Hills Motorway in Baulkham Hills. It is 4 lanes (2 lanes each way) for its entire length.

The Light Horse Interchange is the junction of the M4 and M7 motorways. The stack interchange is the largest of its type in the southern hemisphere. It was named in honour of an Australian World War One formation, the Australian Light Horse. It is also the only one in Australia

The Westlink was built as a fully tolled, gateless motorway employing electronic payment, with an initial toll-free period that ended on 15 January 2006. The toll was originally 29.91 cents per kilometre, capped after 20 kilometres (12 mi) at $5.98. On 1 April 2006, this increased to 30.07 cents per kilometre, capped after 20 kilometres (12 mi) at $6.01. As of 2015, the toll was 38.31 cents per kilometre, capped at $7.66, and adjusted quarterly according to the CPI.

Red Lady of Paviland

Red Lady of Paviland is the name of an almost complete skeleton, which was found in a cave about from Swansea, in 1823. It was the first time, there was a scientific publication on the find of an anatomically modern man. The skeleton turned out to be 33.000 years old, and was probably among the first people on the British Isles.

The skeleton was painted with red ochre. As pearls and ivory was found nearby, the skeleton was first thought to be that of a woman. William Buckland who found it, thought that it must have been that of a witch or a prosititute during the Roman Era Britain. In 1968, radiocarbo dating was done, and the skeleton was found to be about 22.000 years old. The man had been bout 21, at the time of his death. The age of 22.000 years was problematic though: it meant that the British Isles would have been settled during a time when it was very cold. Another dating was done in 1989; it found an age of 33.000 years. Another dating, done in 2008, gave an age of 33.000 years. 33.000 years ago, there was one of the warmer periods of the ice age. 

Today , the skeleton is kept at the Oxford Museum of Natural History.

Previously, he was the Minister of Defense and Veterans Affairs under President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta from 2014 to 2015. Ndaw led a coup d'état in August 2020 which deposed Keïta.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that happened during Ndaw's presidency, covid cases rose in Mali. Thus, Ndaw immediately called for vaccines from South Africa, Russia and the West. While the cases declined, the economy of Mali was still unstable.

Because of the failure of Ndaw and his government of handling the economy, Ndaw's Vice President, Assimi Goïta, led another coup d'état on 25 May 2021 which deposed Ndaw. Eventually, Ndaw and his Prime Minister Moctar Ouane were arrested by the military and taken to Kati military base nearby the Malian capital Bamako. The next day, the UN Chief António Guterres called for their immediate release.

On 27 August 2021, Ndaw and Ouane were eventually released from house arrest after an approval from Assimi Goïta.

If an advertisement has a click through rate of 5%, this means out of 100 people who saw the advertisement, 5 people clicked the link and reached the target website.

Click though rate has decreased significantly over the past years. In 1994, an advertisement was placed by AT&T on the website HotWired. This is considered as the world's first digital advertisement.

Rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis is where damaged skeletal muscles quickly break down. The symptoms can be muscle pains, weakness, vomiting, and confusion. There can also be confusion and tea-colored urine. Rhabdomyolysis can also injure the kidneys with myoglobin.

Duck, duck, goose

Duck, duck, goose is a traditional game, three teams play outdoors. The idea of the game is simple: Everyone sits in a circle and chooses a person who, with a handkerchief in his hand, walks behind the back of the other participants while a song is played. Before the end of the song, the person walking around should throw a handkerchief on someone's back and quickly surround the other participants to take their place. During this time, the person for whom the handkerchief was thrown should get up quickly and catch the person running. If she fails, she takes the handkerchief and goes around the circle and then the cycle repeats.

A simpler adaptation includes 1 group of people in a circle sitting down. 1 person walks around the circle one by one tapping people on the top of their head stating either duck or goose. If duck was said that person stays sitting, if goose is called the person who had their head tapped as goose was said stands up and attempts to catch the person walking. The person walking then starts running attempting to reach the spot that the sitting person once sat at and sit down in that spot. If the person walking manages to sit where the person was sitting before the person they called goose on catches them, they become a sitter and the person that was called goose becomes the new person walking around the circle. If the person called goose catches the person that called goose on them, they return to where they were sitting and the person caught stays as the person walking around the circle. Once the new person (including the same person) has been chosen the cycle repeats until every person has been goose at least once.

Quark-star

Quark-star is hypothetical celestial object that is intermediate in density between a neutron star and black hole, as the remnant of a massive neutron star that has collapsed with gravitational pressure sufficient to reduce all constituent particles to strange quarks. Quark-star can be smallest than 11 kilometers diameter. Like neutron stars, quark star are composed of neutrons that have undergone enough pressure by the collapse of the star to have lost their differentiation and disolved into a mass of quarks and gluons. The up and down quarks of which neutrons are composed than change into strange quarks, with the resulting strange mattery compacting into an even denser mass than a neutron star.


Quasi-star

A quasi-star, also known as black hole star, is a hypothetical type of star believed to have existed in the beginning of the universe when most of the existing material was hydrogen and helium. Instead of a normal nuclear fusion core, the core of a quasi-star would be a black hole.

Quasi-stars are stars that were so massive that while they were still alive, their cores became a black hole. But, the quasi-star didn't go supernova like in normal stars today. The star was so big that the supernova happening inside the star didn't destroy it.

These quasi-stars might have been made in dark matter halos. The gravity of these dark matter halos brought in a lot of gas, which created very big stars.

Normally in stars today, nuclear fusion stops the star's gravity from crushing it. But in quasi-stars, the black hole inside causes matter from the star to move around it. This releases a lot of energy and stops the star's gravity from crushing the star. 

Quasi-stars lived for about 7 million years. The black hole at the center of the star could grow up to 1,000 to 10,000 solar masses. If quasi-stars existed the black holes they created could have become the supermassive black holes we see at the center of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way. Quasi-stars were very very very big, as big as our solar system. They were also as bright and heavy as a small galaxy.

Common mist frog

The common mist frog, Atherton Tableland tree frog, creek frog ("Ranoidea rhecola") is a tree frog from Australia. Scientists saw it in northern Queensland. It lives as low as sea level and as high as 1120 metres up in the hills.

This frog is in danger of dying out. It lives in rainforests and sclerophyll forests, in streams where the water flows quickly. The adult male frog spends time in rocky streams and the female frog and young frog sit on plants near streams. The tadpole lives where the water flows fast. They hold onto rocks with their mouths, which are on the undersides of their bodies.

The female frog lays 46-63 eggs at a time. They are 2.4-2.6 mm in diameter. She lays them in groups under rocks in the water.

Scientists are not sure why this frog is endangered, but they do not think it is droughts or that humans have changed too much of the wild places where they live. This is because Australia made laws protecting the frogs' home in 1988, but there are still fewer and fewer of them. Scientists say one reason this frog is endangered is because pigs that have run away from people run through their streams and kill adult frogs. This frog can catch the fungal disease chytridiomycosis.

Scientists say this frog is related to "Ranoidea nannotis".

Many potting mixes contain vermiculute or perlite, which keep the potting mix fluffy so air can reach the plant's roots. Potting mix allows for drainage, meaning it holds on to water long enough for the plant to take some of it, but then the rest of the water flows away so that the roots do not become too wet.

Proud Boys

The Proud Boys are a twenty-first century alt-right organization. Most of their movements are done in the United States. A Canadian-British man named Gavin McInnes started the group because he hoped Donald Trump would win the 2016 United States presidential election. The Proud Boys only allow men to join, so there are no women. They call themselves "western chauvinists," meaning they think western civilization is the best. They claim that they are not racist, not alt-right and do not support white supremacy, fascism or violence. Experts disagree with these claims, saying that they are racist, alt-right and supportive of white supremacy and violence.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, the Proud Boys hate women, Muslims, transmen and transwomen, and immigrants. The United States FBI list them as an extremist group. The Southern Poverty Law Center says they are a hate group.

The proud boy’s have been banned from Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites. Square, J.P. Morgan Chase and Paypal all stopped processing payments from the Proud Boys' online store.

The Proud Boys like to show up to places where liberal organizations are protesting to counter-protest and fight. 

In 2017, Proud Boy Jason Kessler helped organize the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. There, the Proud Boys joined Neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan to say they did not want a statue of Robert E. Lee taken down. A woman named Heather Heyer was killed when a right-winger drove his car into a crowd.

In 2019, some Proud Boys were arrested in New York for physically attacking members of Antifa, an anti-fascist group. The Proud Boys have shown up to Black Lives Matter protests.

The Proud Boys say that they are not racist and say they do not like white supremacy, racism, violence or fascism. However, many people and groups inside their group do support fascism and other ideas like fascism. They like to carry weapons where other people will see them. They say they must exist as a politically right counter to the anti-fascist people in Antifa. According to scholar Amy Cooter of Vanderbilt University, they do support white supremacy and only say they don't. Cooter told "USA Today" that the Proud Boys are trying not to look like Neo-Nazis. 

Joan Donovan of Harvard University's Technology and Social Change Research Project said the Proud Boys don't want to be called a hate group because then they cannot use Paypal, Chase or most other programs that let people sell things or collect money that people give them through the Internet. Most online payment collection services, for example PayPal, say in their terms of service that they will not work with hate groups. In 2019, McInnes sued the SPLC for calling the Proud Boys a hate group.

The Proud Boys are very good with technology and social media. As late as 2018, they used Facebook to bring in new members. They had rules and prizes for different things. A member could earn "first degree" by posting a video of himself saying the Proud Boys oath: ""My name is ____, I'm from ____, ____, and I am a western chauvinist who refuses to apologize for creating the modern world." You can add anything else you'd like to your video, as long as you say those words exactly." Members could earn other degrees by letting other Proud Boys beat them up, getting a Proud Boys tattoo or getting into a fight "for the cause."

The Proud Boys became more famous on September 29, 2020 because the candidates talked about them in the first debate of the 2020 United States presidential election. Presidential debates are when the two or more people who want to be president stand on a stage. Another person called a moderator asks them questions and lets them argue with each other. People watch in person or on television or the Internet.

Then-President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden debated each other that night. The host running the debate, Chris Wallace, asked Trump if he would say white supremacist and militia groups were bad and tell them to stop hurting people and breaking property. Donald Trump asked Wallace to say the name of a specific group. Biden said "The Proud Boys." Then Donald Trump said "Proud Boys, stand back and stand by, but you know what? Someone's got to do something about Antifa." In English, "stand by" means "wait and be ready to act."

According to Elon University professor Megan Squire, this made the Proud Boys "extremely happy." "They reacted exactly as I thought they would," Squire told "USA Today". "They were extremely excited by what he said. They felt validated. They took it the same way everybody listening took it — that he was giving them a shout-out, basically."

A few days later, gay men started to use the #ProudBoys Twitter hashtag. Officially, Twitter does not allow Proud Boys to post, but some do anyway. Gay men posted pictures of themselves with their husbands or other partners and tagged the posts #ProudBoys, because they are boys and they are proud. Englishman Matt Dechaine started the idea. He said he did it to "spread joy" and work for "movement for positive change [...] rooted in respect and love for each other."

Enrique Tarrio said thought the idea was funny but did not like it for other reasons: "One of the messages they want to send with this is that they're trying to drown out our supporters, they're trying to silence us. ... When you're trying to drown out other people's thoughts, I don't think there's anything progressive about that. Why don't these people just engage?"

Proud Boys like to wear red MAGA hats because they support United States President Donald Trump. They also like to wear black-and-yellow Fred Perry polo shirts. Fred Perry stopped selling the shirts in the United States because they do not like the Proud Boys.

After Donald Trump told them "stand back and stand by," Proud Boys started wearing clothes saying "Standing back and standing by."

Environmental racism

Many countries make rules to protect the environment. These rules can be laws, guidelines, or regulations. Ideally, these rules affect all groups in society in the same way. When this is not the case, and one group or community is affected more than the others, this is known as environmental racism. As is common with racism, the groups are defined based on race, or skin color; sometimes on income. Very often, all the people decide on these rules. When some groups are excluded from the decision-making process, this is also known as environmental racism.

Benjamin Chavis first used the term, in the 1980s. At the time, he was a leading member of the Civil rights movement in the United States. The movement found that when a new landfill was constructed, minorities such as hispanics and black people were affected more often than the white people. The explanation given was the difference in income - hispanics and black people often earn less than white people. A study of 2007 showed that this explanation is too simple and that there are more complex patterns at play. The study also showed that environmental racism occurs in almost all bigger cities in the United States.

The term was later used to describe the situation in the Niger delta, and in Western New Guinea.

Environmental justice is a term that started about the same time; it focuses more on distributing the benefits and burdens of environmental policies equally in society.

Observational learning

One way to learn new skills is by observing the behavior of other people or animals. This is called Observational learning. It is a form of social learning which can take different forms. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement; instead a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings is needed. For a child, a model is someone of authority or higher status in an environment. In animals, observational learning is often based on classical conditioning. In classical conditioning instinctive behavior is provoked by observing the behavior of another (e.g. mobbing in birds), but other processes may be involved as well.

Many behaviors that a learner observes, remembers, and imitates are actions that the model does not try to intentionally instill: A child may learn to swear, smack, smoke, and deem other inappropriate behavior acceptable through poor modeling. Albert Bandura claims that children continually learn desirable and undesirable behavior through observational learning. Observational learning suggests that an individual's environment, cognition, and behavior all incorporate and ultimately determine how the individual functions and models.

Through observational learning, individual behaviors can spread across a culture through a process called "diffusion chain". This occurs when an individual first learns a behavior by observing another individual and that individual serves as a model for other individuals to learn the behavior.

Culture plays a role in whether observational learning is the dominant learning style in a person or community. Some cultures expect children to actively participate in their communities: the children are therefore exposed to different trades and roles on a daily basis. This exposure allows children to observe and learn the different skills and practices that are valued in their communities.

Albert Bandura, who is known for the classic Bobo doll experiment, identified this basic form of learning in 1961. The importance of observational learning lies in helping individuals, especially children, acquire new responses by observing others' behavior.

<nowiki> </nowiki>Albert Bandura states that people's behavior could be determined by their environment. Observational learning occurs through observing negative and positive behaviors. Bandura believes in reciprocal determinism in which the environment can influence people's behavior and vice versa. For instance, the Bobo doll experiment shows that the model, in a determined environment, affects children's behavior. In this experiment Bandura demonstrates that one group of children placed in an aggressive environment would act the same way, while the control group and the other group of children placed in a passive role model environment hardly shows any type of aggression.

In communities where children's primary mode of learning is through observation, the children are rarely separated from adult activities. This allows children to use observational learning skills in multiple spheres of life. This learning through observation requires them to be attentive. Culturally, they learn that their participation and contributions are valued in their communities. This teaches children that it is their duty, as members of the community, to observe others' contributions so they gradually become involved and participate more in the community.

When an animal is given a task to complete, it is almost always more successful after observing another animal doing the same task before them. Experiments with several different species have shown the same effect: animals can learn behaviors from peers. However, there is a need to make a difference between the propagation of behavior and the stability of behavior. An animal might show the behaviour just once. In this case, the behaviour is not stable. Research has shown that social learning can spread a behavior, but there are more factors regarding how a behaviour is spread from one generaton of animals to the next, in an animal culture.

Experiments with ninespine sticklebacks showed that individuals will use social learning to locate food.

A study in 1996 at the University of Kentucky used a foraging device to test social learning in pigeons. A pigeon could access the food reward by either pecking at a treadle or stepping on it. Significant correspondence was found between the methods of how the observers accessed their food and the methods the initial model used in accessing the food.

The University of Washington studied this phenomenon with crows: There is a tradeoff between acquiring costly information firsthand and learning that information socially. Using social learning is easier for the individual, but there is a risk of inaccuracy. The experimenters exposed wild crows to a unique “dangerous face” mask as they trapped, banded, and released 7-15 birds at five different study places around Seattle, WA. An immediate scolding response to the mask after trapping by previously captured crows illustrates that the individual crow learned the danger of that mask. There was a scolding from crows that were captured that had not been captured initially. That response indicates conditioning from the mob of birds that assembled during the capture.

Learning from peers is called horizontal social learning, learning from parents is called vertical social learning. Horizontal social learning is consistent with the lone crows that recognized the dangerous face without ever being captured. Children of captured crow parents were conditioned to scold the dangerous mask, which demonstrates earning from parents. The crows that were captured directly had the most precise discrimination between dangerous and neutral masks than the crows that learned from the experience of their peers. The ability of crows to learn doubled the frequency of scolding, which spread at least 1.2  km from where the experiment started to over a 5-year period at one site.

Observational learning allows for new skills to be learned in a wide variety of areas. Demonstrations help the modification of skills and behaviors.

When learning skills for physical activities can be anything that is learned that requires physical movement, such as learning a sport, learning to eat with a fork, or learning to walk. There are multiple important factors that help with modifying physical skills and psychological responses from an observational learning standpoint. Modeling is a factor in observational learning where the skill level of the model is considered. When someone is supposed to demonstrate a physical skill such as throwing a baseball the model should be able to execute the behavior of throwing the ball flawlessly if the model of learning is a mastery model. Another model that can be used is a coping model: This model would show a physical skill that they have not yet mastered or achieved high performance in. Both models are found to be effective and can be used. These models can be used as interventions to increase observational learning in practice, competition, and rehabilitation situations.

Recent research in neuroscience has shown that mirror neurons are the basis for observational learning. These specialized visuomotor neurons fire action potentials when an individual performs a motor task and also fire when an individual passively observes another individual performing the same motor task. In observational motor learning, the process begins with a visual presentation of another individual performing a motor task, this acts as a model. The learner then needs to transform the observed visual information into internal motor commands that will allow them to perform the same motor task; this is known as visuomotor transformation. Mirror neuron networks provide a mechanism for visuo-motor and motor-visual transformation and interaction. Similar networks of mirror neurons have also been implicated in social learning, motor cognition and social cognition.

White Fawn's Devotion

White Fawn's Devotion: A Play Acted by a Tribe of Red Indians in America is a Silent movie. It was filmed in 1910, in the United States. James Young Deer wrote and directed the film, but is not credited for this. His wife, Lillian St. Cyr is credited for playing Princess Red Wing as "White Fawn". The lead woman does not fit St. Cyr's description, so few people believe she played in the movie. The movie was shot in New Jersey at 24fps.

"White Fawn's Devotion" is the earliest surviving movie directed by a Native American. It was one of the earlier movies the French movie company Pathé shot in America. A reviewer in the "New York Dramatic Mirror" wrote that the movie "proves to be interesting if we can forget the New Jersey scenery" and noted that "it is not quite clear where the devotion comes in, nor of what it consists.".

In 2008, the movie was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

When a settler in the Dakotas learns that he will inherit a large fortune, his Native American wife is upset. Believing that she will lose her husband if he returns East, she stabs herself with a knife. Her husband finds her and removes the knife, but their daughter sees him with the knife in his hand and her apparently dead mother. The girl believes that her father committed the murder, and alerts the nearby Indian village. Several Indians then chase the settler. When the settler is captured, the Indians intend to put him to death until White Fawn miraculously comes to life again. She tells the truth to the Indians. This ending, in which an interracial couple ends up together, is a rare occurrence for this period of film production.

James Young Deer (also known as J. Younger Johnston or James Young Johnson) was believed to be the first Native American film director. His ancestors were members of the Nanticoke people of Delaware. Young Deer was hired by Pathé Frères as a director and scenario writer and frequently worked in collaboration with his actress wife Lillian St. Cyr, also known by her stage name Princess Red Wing. He made over 100 movies. "White Fawn's Devotion" is one of them.

White House COVID-19 outbreak

In September and October 2020, multiple people at the White House tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. 

On September16, it was reported that at least one unnamed staffer had tested positive.

On October 1, President Donald Trump, his wife Melania Trump, press advisor Hope Hicks, presidential campaign manager Bill Stepien, and former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway tested positive for the coronavirus. Claudia Conway, the daughter of Kellyanne Conway, announced on Oct 4 that she had tested positive as well. On October5, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced she had also tested positive.

Trump tested positive days after the first presidential debate against Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio. Around eleven people tested positive who worked at the debates in Cleveland. Some of Trump's personal aides who prepared him for the debates also tested positive.

Many of the cases were rooted to be at the announcement of Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the United States Supreme Court on September 26 and at a Trump campaign fundraiser event in Bedminster, New Jersey on October 1.

That same day, it was revealed that Senators Thom Tillis and Mike Lee both tested positive, as well as University of Notre Dame president John I. Jenkins. Three members of the White House press corps, including Michael D. Shear, also tested positive. 

On October 2, Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. 

Also on October 2, many individuals connected to the White House were diagnosed with COVID-19.

On October 4, Trump left the hospital in order to ride past a gathering of supporters at the medical center, waving from the back seat of an SUV, before returning to the hospital. This was seen as a political stunt and many criticized Trump for possible putting other people at risk for getting infected. Many Secret Service agents were upset at Trump as he could have infected them with one agent saying: "He's not even pretending to care now".

The incident has been compared to the non-fatal shooting of Ronald Reagan in 1981, which saw similar concerns over continuity of government amid incapacitation of the president.

Stock markets briefly fell more than 1.5 percent after Trump announced his diagnosis, but they cut their losses after Pelosi said she anticipated an economic relief deal. The S&P 500 Index ended the day down almost 1 percent.

Twitter announced that any posts wishing for Trump's death would be removed for violating the platform's terms of service. Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Ayanna Pressley criticized Twitter for not taking threats against them seriously, pointing to longstanding posts calling for their deaths that had not been removed. Facebook and TikTok announced similar policies.

Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen, Presidential candidate Joe Biden, Biden's running mate Kamala Harris, Biden's wife Jill Biden, Attorney General William Barr, and Trump Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett all tested negative in the day following public revelation of the outbreak. 

Many of Trump's family members, including Ivanka Trump, Barron Trump, Jared Kushner, Eric Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. also received a negative result.

Richard Johnson (referred to as "Dick") is a retired clinical psychiatrist who is suffering from dementia.

She also has him act out his own funeral and fantasizes about him entering the gates of heaven. Dick amiably plays along with her black humor; in one scene he proposes, "You can euthanize me."


TUT.BY

TUT.BY is a web portal from Minsk, Belarus, in Russian and Belarusian languages. It has been runned since 2000. It is a very big website in the country.<ref name="Akt 9/20"></ref>

It is a website to read about the 2020 Belarusian protests and 2020 Belarusian presidential election, more. Because of that, at the end of September 2020, the Ministry of Information of Belarus stopped the TUT.BY’s media rights for three months from October 1. The international organization Reporters Without Borders named it a cruel attack on the web portal. The USA together with more than fifty other countries and the EU asked the Belarusian government to stop such attacks.

Yuri Zisser (1960–2020) made the website in October 2000. The website worked with digital media rights since January 2019.
Journalist Katsyaryna Barysevich wrote an article about the death of Raman Bandarenka in 2020. She was arrested in Minsk on November 19, 2020. On March 2, 2021, she was sentenced to a half-year in prison and got a fine for that.

On May 18, 2021, the TUT.BY office and the houses of its main people were looked for. It was a result of the just opened TUT.BY tax evasion criminal case. Since that day, the domain name was stopped working, copies of the TUT.BY website and the E-mail system of TUT.BY can't be opened. The Ministry of Information of Belarus made such punishment for "prohibited information" that the website has been having over it. One example of such information was named. It was information of BYSOL. BYSOL is a foundation that helps people who got punishments because of the 2020 Belarusian protests. At least 18 people who worked for TUT.BY were arrested on May 18, 2021.

As of May 25, 2021, 12 people were put in isolation centers, including the main editor Maryna Zolatava. As of May 25, 2021, three people, including the widow of Yuri Zisser Julia Charnyauskaya, were under a house arrest. On May 25, 2021, nine organizations (the Viasna Human Rights Centre, the Belarusian Association of Journalists, the Belarusian Helsinki Committee and others) made a statement together. They named all of 15 people political prisoners.

On July 8, 2021, a part of journalists of TUT.BY that was free made the second website Zerkalo.io. They said that this domain name is going to be used until TUT.BY can work in Belarus again. Since July 8, 2021, the website Zerkalo.io can't be opened in Belarus. In August, the Central District court of Minsk recognized both the new and the old projects and their content as extremist materials, which makes its distribution a misdemeanor offense in Belarus.

In June 2022, TUT BY MEDIA was declared extremist by a court in Minsk.

In March 2023, both Zolotova and Chekina were sentenced to 12 years in a general regime penal colony.

In June 2023, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus designated Zerkalo as an extremist formation.

Spencer's river tree frog

Spencer's tree frog, Spencer's river tree frog or the spotted tree frog ("Ranoidea spenceri") is a tree frog from Australia. It lives near the Great Dividing Range in Victoria and New South Wales. It lives between 200 and 1200 metres above sea level.

The adult frog is 4.2 to 7.0 cm in length. It is green or brown and can have spots. This frog lives in forests on mountains, both dense forests and open forests, both dry forests high in the mountains and wet forests lower down. It always lives in rocky places near streams.

The female frog lays 300-1000 eggs at a time in between rocks or underneath rocks in the water. The tadpoles eat algae off rocks and dead things from the bottoms of the water. Male frogs that live near the bottoms of mountains become adults 18 months after transforming from tadpoles to frogs. Female frogs that live near the bottoms of mountains become adults 3.5 years after transforming into frogs. Male frogs that live high in the mountains become adults 3.5 years after transforming into frogs. Female frogs that live high in the mountains become adults 4.5 years after transforming into frogs. Adult frogs eat insects.

This frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists only ever saw this frog in 19 streams. The frog has disappeared from 4 of them. The other streams make up 12 groups of frogs who only mate within their group. Adult frogs do not move much. Scientists think a single frog does not move more than 80 meters in its whole life.

Scientists are not sure why this frog is endangered, but they think many of them died during the 20th century. They think two types of invasive species, the rainbow trout and brown trout are eating the tadpoles. This frog can catch the fungal disease chytridiomycosis.

Laudanum is the name of a tincture containing opium. A tincture is usually an extract of plant or animal material dissolved in ethanol (ethyl alcohol). Laudanum is dissolved extracts from the opium poppy ("Papaver somniferum" Linnaeus) in alcohol (ethanol).

Paracelsus thought that it was good for treating almost anything. According to Paracelus, laudanum consists of about 9 parts wine, and one part opium. Other ingredients, such as henbane, mandrake and deadly nightshade were commonly added. Since its discovery in the 16th century, laudanum was often used to treat different diseases. Its popularity and use is comparable to the modern drug aspirin. Its main effect was that of the opium: it was a painkiller, and a sedative. 

The main problem is that opium causes addiction. This was only understood in the 19th century. Towards the end of the 19th century, there were good alternative drugs. England banished opiates from open sale in the 1920s, and Germany regulated their use in 1929. 

Laudanum, like other opiates was used as a painkiller, and a sedative. Until the 1970s it was used to treat clinical depression. Laudanum is dangerous to children as it is easy to get an overdose. Today, laudanum is still used to treat severe cases of diarrhea which sometimes occur with chemotherapy.

Even though it is called the New England tree frog, it does not live in New England. It lives on Australia's New England Tablelands. It lives near the Great Dividing Range in Queensland and New South Wales. It lives more than 600 metres above sea level.

The adult male frog is 4.0 cm long and the adult female is 5.0 cm long. It can be green or brown on the back and green on the sides. It has a white stripe on each side of its body. Parts of its sides and legs are bright orange.

The tadpoles are about 3.5 cm long. Unlike tadpoles of other tree frogs, they do not have teeth or beaks. Instead, they have things similar to tentacles near their mouths. Scientists do not know what the tadpoles eat.

This frog is in some danger of dying out. Scientists say this is because human beings take animals to eat grass where the frog lives and collect trees from its forests for lumber. Invasive species such as trout also eat the eggs and tadpoles.

Scientists say this frog is related to "Ranoidea citropa".

Unserdeutsch

Rabaul Creole German (also called Unserdeutsch, our German) is a creole language spoken in Papua New Guinea, and parts of Australia. It is the only German-based Creole language with an ISO code. It was developed in Papua New Guinea, around 1900. At that time, Papua New Guinea was a German colony. Today, most speakers live in Eastern Australia. Most speakers are old, so the language will soon disappear. Australian speakers of Unserdeutsch now live scattered in cities on the east coast, but communicate with one another in closed groups of social networks. It is estimated that fewer than ten Unserdeutsch speakers live in Papua New Guinea today. All speakers of Unserdeutsch know at least two other languages. In most cases, these are English and Tok Pisin. Estimates are that there are about 100 speakers left.

Unserdeutsch developed around 1900 around today's provincial capital Kokopo. At the time, this city was called Herbertshöhe. It was the seat of the provincial governor of German New Guinea. There was a Catholic school at the outskirts of town, which taught mixed-race children standard German. Most of the time, the mothers were locals, from Melanesia, and the fathers were Europeans; most often from Germany. They were civil servants, traders, and adventurers.

Outside school, the children mixed the high German with the local language Tok Pisin. They were not allowed to use Tok Pisin in school. The language that developed essentially used German words, with the grammar from Tok Pisin. Even after German rule in Papua New Guinea ended, the Vunapope mission station (which ran the school) remained in German hands with German as a school subject and even partly as the language of instruction. Since the children who developed Unserdeutsch often kept to themselves as mixed-race children and got married, they passed their Unserdeutsch on to the next generation and Unserdeutsch became the Creole language. After Papua New Guinea gained independence from Australia in 1975, most of the Unserdeutsch speakers decided to take on Australian citizenship and to emigrate to Australia, especially Queensland, because offices and posts in their homeland were to be filled by indigenous Papuans.

Unserdeutsch is a spoken language; there is no governing body that regulates how to write it.

Linguists at the University of Augsburg (now: University of Bern) began to research Unserdeutsch in 2014.

Nouns in Unserdeutsch have no gender. The article is always called “de”, for example de Mann, de Frau, de Haus. The plural of a noun is formed by prefixing the word “alle” with: “alle Frau”, “alle Knabe”. Interrogative pronouns are often placed at the end of the question sentence (“Du geht wo? "). Sometimes, words from Tok Pisin and English are used, for example “aufpicken” (In English: to pick up) for “abholen” (translates as fetch). Unserdeutsch is a strict SVO language.

Two planned languages were developed to be used in German colonies: One is called Weltdeutsch, the other is called Kolonialdeutsch.

Binary coded decimal

Binary coded decimal is a way to encode numbers. The number is first split into digits, and each digit is then encoded in binary. This will result in a code from 0 0 0 0 (for "0") to "1 0 0 1" (for 9). The other codes (1010 to 1 1 1 1, representing the numbers 10 to 15) are not valid.

Flag of Hyderabad State

The Flag of Hyderabad state is the flag of the State of hyderabad. The Hyderabad state flag shows Green and Red (fly) with a Star and reversed Crescent (in white) in the centre, used as a state flag. It was annexed by India in 1948, after Winston Churchill had proposed to the United Nations to consider it as an independent state.

The forebears of the Asaf Jahi Dynasty came to India from Samarkand, in Central Asia, but the family actually originated from Baghdad. In 1724, the Mughal Governor of the Deccan, (Nizam ul-Mulk) Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I, established himself as an independent ruler of Deccan. Hyderabad became the capital and later lent its name to that of the state he had created. The first Nizam's successors became closely allied to the British colonialists, frequently assisting them in subduing their enemies, the Maratha dynasty, Tipu Sultan of Mysore, and the French. In later years, the Nizam's troops invariably took part in all the main campaigns undertaken by the British Indian Army. Large numbers of his troops took part in the First and Second World Wars. These contributions earned for the Nizam unequalled titles and honours from a grateful Emperor.

The state was the largest and premier of all princely states within the British Indian Empire. After the Pakistani and Indian Independences, the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad, Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII decided that the Princely state of Hyderabad will not join the New Dominion of India or Dominion of Pakistan. His decision found favour with Pakistan but not with India, when he formally declared it on the 24th of August in 1947 respectively. The Nizam’s state was a prosperous one and had its own army, railway and airline network, postal system and radio network. On 15th August 1947, India declared itself an independent nation. And so did Hyderabad.

At the time of the Independence movement of India, the State of Hyderabad was the largest of all princely states in India. The Nizam ruled over lands extending to cover 82,698 mi² (214,190 km²) of fairly homogenous territory and was bigger than Belarus but was smaller than the Guyana. The Nizam ruled over a cosmopolitan comprised of a population of roughly 16.34 million people (as per the 1941 census) of which a majority (83%) was Hindu. These advantages persuaded the Nizam to attempt an Independent existence when the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. He blatantly refused to succumb to be subdued to any pressure whatsoever to reluctantly join either India or Pakistan, preferring to form a separate Kingdom of its own within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Hyderabad State had its own Army, Airline, Telecommunication system, railway network, postal system, currency and Radio broadcasting service.

On 6 October 1948, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Zafarullah, requested the President of the United Nations Security Council that Pakistan be permitted to participate in the discussion of the Hyderabad question in accordance with Article 31 of the United Nations' Charter. The Government of Pakistan took the case and raised the question of the State of hyderabad to the United Nations security council Pursuant to Article 31, where it is still pending for resolution Pakistan has been mainly involved in arguments for the rights of Kashmiris. In spite of raising questions that predominantly affect Pakistan, the Pakistan delegation is often able to play a significant role in debates on other issues as well. As a number of states had not attained independence in the 1950s, Pakistan became an effective spokesman of many Asian states and movements, It states:

In this distinct entity of State of hyderabad, where no official Referendum was held and where the ruler did not accede, the forced accession to India brought about by Military action, was presumed to have the tacit approval of the predominantly Hindu population. In each case of annexation there was a different rationale, but a similar goal, namely Annexation of territories. The use of military force provided the only consistency in India's policy. The state that was once so well noted for its religious and ethnic toleration, ruled by a highly cultured and intellectually brilliant elite who maintained all that was best in the old Mughal order, was now no more. Although it has not always been satisfied with the effectiveness of the United Nations to act on Kashmir, Pakistan remains a keen and active member. Pakistan would like to see the United Nations strengthened so that it can serve as an effective force to uphold International law and protect weaker states.

Flag of Junagadh State

The flag of former Junagadh State is based on the Civil State Ensign of the Flag of Pakistan in the canton. According to traditional official description, The badge is a white disk with Green objects are described in the warrant as 'bezants' and 'mountains' in the centre of the disk, with the name of the state at the top, with the state badge located in the fly respectively.

Junagadh and Bantva-Manavadar was a Princely "Maritime State" which faced towards the Arabian Sea with Pakistan, in the Kathiawar Peninsula, the capital city was Junagarh. Ruled by Muslim rulers in British Raj till its illegal annexation into the Indian nation in 1948. It had an area of 8,904.6 Sq. Km² (3,438 Sq. Mi²) and was bigger than Puerto Rico but was smaller than the Cyprus.

Mohammad Sher khan Babi, who owed allegiance to the Mughal governor of Gujarat subah, founded the state of Junagadh and declaring independence in 1730 after Marathas Gaikwad invasion. Muhammad Sher khan Babi, was the founder of the "Babi Dynasty" of Junagadh State dynasty. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh, conquered large territories in southern Saurashtra and ruled over the state for the next two centuries, first as tributaries of Marathas, and later under the Suzerainty of the British Raj. The Junagadh family shares joint descent with the princely houses of Radhanpur and Balasinor, and the small states of Bantva, Manavadar and Sardargarh. Descendents of the Ghilzai Pathans from Afghanistan, they entered India under Usman Khan Babi, a follower of Emperor Humayun. His son, Sher Khan Babi, arrived in Gujarat in the train of Prince Murad Baksh, the Imperial Viceroy. For many years, the family remained the faithful, though powerful, local fief holders of and exceptional loyalty to the Mughal power. The impending collapse of the Islamic Indian empire during the early years of the eighteenth century, prompted the family household to carve out independent Kingdoms of their own to govern, from various landholdings and governorships they held sway. Sher Khan Babi, the Chief of the family, founded the state by expelling the then Mogul Governor in 1735. Originally a Rajput domain, it fell to the Muslims commanded by Mohammed Bagra of Ahmedabad in 1472.

Sher Khan's descendent held the posts and ruled over the state for the next two centuries, for a period as tributaries of Baroda, and later it came under the Suzerainty of the British Raj. In 1807 the Junagadh State became a British protectorate and The East India Company took control of the state by 1818 and the Saurashtra area with other Princely states of Kathiawar peninsula were separately administrated under Kathiawar Agency by British India.

In 1947 upon the Independence of Pakistan and the Indian Transfer of Power, the last Babi dynasty ruler of the state Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III merged it into newly formed Dominion of Pakistan. Although surrounded on three sides by the Dominion of India, and on the fourth by open Arabian Sea. On 15th August it acceded to Pakistan and Pakistan Government accepted on 13th September 1947, following the Independence of the new Dominions of the Republic of India and Pakistan, the Khan Sahib Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji acceded his state of Manavadar to Pakistan, even though, being a Vassal state of Junagadh State, the prince had every right to do so. This act was done at the same time as his master, the Nawab of Junagadh who himself had the right not to accede his state to modern India, this was fully in accordance with the agreed principles for accession of Princely states. The accession not agreeable to the Indians, they applied various methods of tactic intimidation. They induced two vassal rulers to accede to their country in return for recognition as independent rulers, but even this did not last very long. Simultaneously, 'People's Committees' and the Indian National Congress party agitators were most encouraged to ferment civil unrest and create disturbances, against the new Dominion of Pakistan aimed at reducing the administration to chaos. The Nawab and his remaining family had fled to the safety fearing for their lives on the 24th October in 1947, and chose to flee to their desired country, followed shortly afterwards by his Prime Minister they all eventually settled in the port city of Karachi (then as the capital of the nation).

In response to this Indian armed occupying forces acted very quickly and illegally entered the abandoned state by invading it inhabitants and assumed full control on the poor defenceless people, then arranged a Referendum by the GOI under their own organised auspices and even appointed its own administrator on the 9th November. The largely Hindu population were influenced and inevitably expressed an overwhelming wish to join the India. A mere 91 voters out of 201, 457 souls taking part wanted to remain and voted in favour of Pakistan. A surprising result, given that the state had a 40% Muslim population, which was considered a Dependency to the allied country by safeguarding their rights as a minority now as the claimed Disputed territory of Pakistan. Nawab Mahabat Khan III is much maligned by modern Indian "historians" and popular writers, largely because of his concern for wildlife and domesticated animals, their welfare and conservation. Much is written about a marriage party that he arranged for a favourite pet dog, but the fact of matter is that Saurashtra was blessed with its only tracts of forests land because of him, was never mentioned. He took major steps and dedication to protect the dwindling Gir forests, final abode of the remaining population of the Asiatic Lions. His interests in animal husbandry improved the breeding stock of Kathiwadi horses and Gir cattle, greatly improving the milk yields of the latter. His reign saw the opening of the massive Willingdon Dam, built the Bahadur Khanji Library and opened the Mahabat Khan free college. Upon his death in 1959 the Government of Pakistan installed and recognised the Junagadh House in Karachi, 9th October 1991. The Nawab of Junagadh Foundation Trust is also located there.

Former flag of East Bengal, Pakistan

The former Flag of East Bengal or East Pakistan flag was the flag of the former Province of East Bengal within a united then East Pakistan. The Bengali east provincial flag showed a Crescent and star within a Red disc on top of a dark green field, offset slightly left towards the hoist so that it appeared centred when the sub-national flag was flying in the erstwhile lost territory. The traditional crescent moon and star was to represent its association with a Federal Pakistan and its commitments to Islam and the wider "Muslim Ummah", the Red disc represented the bloodshed and Partition they fought so hard for a Muslim Indian homeland during the dark days of misrule and occupation by foreign powers, and the new sun rising over Bengal as a new dawn for the celebration of the 1947 Islamic Independence, and also the Muslim blood of those who died for their Muslim League political agenda from the Hindus and the British imperial colonialism. The dark green field stood for the Muslims of the eastern sector land of the former province that united them briefly against the dominant hostile majority non-Muslim of volatile Republic of India. It has been since 1972 replaced by the separatist New current regime of an Independentist aspirant Bangladesh Flag.

Oslo Accords

The Oslo Accords are a pair of agreements between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO): the Oslo I Accord, signed in Washington, D.C., in 1993; and the Oslo II Accord, signed in Taba, Egypt, in 1995.

The first ideas regarding the Oslo Accords started in the Madrid Conference for Peace in 1991. The Oslo negotiations were planned in secret and ultimately led to an agreement after nine months. The accords were meant to create a new relationship between Palestine and Israel on a long-term basis. The Oslo Accords intended to create three changes. The first one is that the accords would give the Palestinian people the right to have political control over its own territories, to have a return of Palestinian leadership. The second one is that the Palestinian national movement PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) could resume their struggle with an open mind. The third one is that the accords brought hope to the Palestinians with them, for the first time since the Nakba.

The Oslo Accords were to create a Palestinian state. However, there was never a mention of a state in both of the documents signed in 1993 and 1995. There has never been a mention of a Two-State solution, but it had been assumed that there would come a two state solution by the Israeli side led by the Labor party.

The Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried to cancel or delay the Oslo Accords, but because of pressure from the United States and Europe the Oslo Accords were continued.

The Oslo Accords marked the start of the Oslo Peace Process. The 1994 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin "for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East. 

The development of the first of the two agreements, the Oslo I Accord, which they also call the Declaration of principles on interim self-governing arrangements (DOP), took place in the capital of Norway, Oslo, and was a secret effort to help along the peace process.During the secret negotiations in Oslo, Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin sent Yasser Arafat, from the PLO, a letter and vice versa. The letters, from Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin respectively, contained the following: the condemnation of terrorism and violence that threatened the Israeli people and their livelihood, the guarantee, by the PLO, that everything would from now on be in compliance with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the acknowledgement that the PLO represented the Palestinian people.This correspondence is considered to be an important element of the accord and indicated the willingness of both parties to recognize each other and further negotiate peace. The signing of the letters took place on 9 and 10 september 1993.Furthermore the Declaration of principles on interim self-governing arrangements (DOP) allowed for the reassessment of the status of territories like Gaza and Jericho, which were occupied and governed by Israel and had no self-determination.The accord demanded the withdrawal of the Israeli army from those places first, but the accord contained the promise, and was considered a starting-point, of a five-year process resulting in more self-determination, although limited, for the Palestinians and the partial withdrawal of the Israeli army from territories in Gaza and the West Bank.The people involved in the negotiations in Oslo came together to discuss Palestine’s future on fourteen different occasions in nine months time.The official signing took place the 13th of september 1993 in Washington and was witnessed by president Bill Clinton. In 1994, again an accord was signed: the Cairo-Accord (Gaza-Jericho-Accord)

The Oslo II Accord was signed in Taba, Egypt in 1995. Heavy protests followed.

A major event that surrounded the establishment of the Oslo II Accord was that Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated on 4 November, 1995, 36 days after the signing of the Oslo II accords on 28 September, 1995. Shimon Peres would be elected after Rabin.

The land got split up in three different areas. The first area is Area A, in which the Palestinian Authority is mostly in control. This area consists of 18 percent of the West Bank, which in the first place only consisted of 3%. The second area, Area B, consists of 22 percent of the West Bank and is under Israeli control depending on security, which means they can enter the areas whenever they want without procedures or legal consequences. The Palestinian Authority is in control of education, health and economy. The third and last area, Area C, is in complete control of the Israeli government. Although it was planned that the Palestinian Authority would gain control over this area, Israel kept being in charge. This area consists of 60 percent of the West Bank.

Spider-Man: Far From Home

Spider-Man: Far from Home is a 2019 American superhero movie based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. The movie was produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the sequel to "" and the 23rd movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre on June 26, 2019, and was released in the United States on July 2, as the last movie of Phase Three. A sequel, titled "", was released in December 2021.

In Ixtenco, Mexico, Nick Fury, and Maria Hill investigate an unnatural storm and encounter the Earth Elemental. Quentin Beck, a super-powered individual, arrives to defeat the creature. Beck subsequently defeats the Elemental and is recruited by Fury and Hill. In New York City, the Midtown School of Science and Technology completes its year, which was restarted to accommodate the students who previously disintegrated five years earlier as a result of Thanos' actions. They had reappeared un-aged, thanks to the actions of the Avengers. The school organizes a two-week summer field trip to Europe, where Peter Parker—who is still mourning the death of his mentor Tony Stark—plans to reveal to classmate MJ his attraction to her. Happy Hogan informs Parker that Fury intends to contact him, but Parker ignores Fury's phone call.

Parker and his classmates travel to Venice, Italy, where the Water Elemental attacks. Parker helps protect his classmates, while Beck arrives and defeats the creature. Fury meets with Parker and gives him Stark's glasses, which were meant for his successor. The glasses enable him to communicate with and take command of the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., which has access to Stark Industries' databases and commands a large orbital weapons supply. Beck claims to have entered from an alternate reality within the Multiverse, where the four Elementals killed his family and destroyed his civilization. With only the Fire Elemental left to destroy, Beck predicts it will attack Prague. Parker declines Fury's invitation to join the fight and returns to his class trip.

Fury secretly changes the class's itinerary to divert the students to Prague. There, Parker is forced to help Beck fight the Fire Elemental to again protect his friends. Beck manages to destroy the creature with Parker's help. Fury and Hill invite Parker and Beck to Berlin to discuss the formation of a new superhero team, but Parker decides that Beck should go alone and transfers control of E.D.I.T.H. to him. Once Parker leaves, Beck celebrates alongside ex-Stark Industries employees, with whom he had been working to masquerade as a superhero. Beck, who was fired from his position as Stark's holographic illusions specialist for his unstable nature, used advanced projectors to simulate his powers and the Elementals and now hopes to use E.D.I.T.H.'s orbital weaponized drones to increase the scale of his illusions and fraudulently establish himself as an Avenger-level hero.

After MJ tells Parker she knows he is Spider-Man, they discover that a piece of debris she retrieved during the battle with the Fire Elemental is a projector that shows the Air Elemental, leading them to realize Beck's deception. Parker travels to Berlin to warn Fury, only to be tricked by Beck with an illusory Fury into revealing the names of his friends who know about Beck's plan and are hit by a train. Left for dead by Beck, Parker contacts Hogan, who flies him to London, where his classmates are. Beck uses E.D.I.T.H. to orchestrate a fusion of all the Elementals, as a cover to kill Parker's friends. Parker can disrupt the illusions, so Beck attacks him with drones. Parker regains control of E.D.I.T.H. and defeats Beck, who is hit by a misfired gunshot from one of the drones; before he dies, Beck tells one of his associates to retrieve data from the drones. After returning to New York City, Parker begins a relationship with MJ.

In a mid-credits scene, J. Jonah Jameson of TheDailyBugle.net broadcasts doctored footage of the London incident in which Beck frames Spider-Man for the drone attack and his death, exposing Spider-Man's secret identity to the world, much to Parker's shock. In a post-credits scene, Fury and Hill are revealed to be the Skrulls Talos and Soren in disguise, under orders from the real Fury while he is away commanding a Skrull spaceship.



It was released on July 2, 2019, and on August 30, 2019, and DVD on October 1, 2019.

Hyla

Hyla is a genus of tree frogs in the family Hylidae. Over the years, scientists have changed their minds about which frog species should be in "Hyla" and which should be in "Litoria", "Ranoidea" or other genera. At one time, "Hyla" had more than 300 species from Europe, Asia, Africa, and across the Americas. Now, "Hyla" has only 17 extant (living) species. They are from Europe, northern Africa and Asia. The earliest known fossil from a "Hyla" frog is †"Hyla swanstoni" from the Eocene. The fossil was found in Saskatchewan, Canada, but it is not clear whether we would consider "swanstoni" a "Hyla" frog today.

Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti made the genus in 1768. He named it after Hylas from Greek mythology. Hylas was a friend of Hercules. Even though the mythological person Hylas was male, the name "Hyla" is given the feminine grammatical gender.

Some people say this word comes from the Greek word ("", "forest" or "wood"), but it does not.

In most "Hyla" frogs, the male frogs sing, and then the female frogs choose which male to mate with based on their songs. But females from different species like different things about male frogs' voices. Female "H. versicolor", for example, choose males whose calls last longer. Female "H. arborea" choose males who show up to sing in the same place for many nights.

In some "Hyla" frogs, the male frogs fight and compete. Male "H. versicolor" frogs show up where the females like to go. This behavior, called lekking, is common in many species of "Hyla". In order to sing clearly, the males need to be a certain distance apart from each other. When one male gets too close to another male's singing place, the two males may fight or do something else that is like fighting. Male "H. versicolor" sometimes show off to each other before they fight, so they can see whether they are likely to win first.

Indirect selection is when one partner chooses a mate based on just one thing that is related to how fit and healthy the mate is all together. "H. arborea" is a frog that is awake at night, and the females listen to the males sing and then choose one, so the frogs must be able to hear well. These frogs can also see well in low light. This ability to see may be related to how females choose males. Scientists say female "H. arborea" choose males with more brightly colored vocal sacs. They think colorful vocal sacs may show that the frog has enough carotenoids in the food it eats. This may mean the male frog is better at finding food than other frogs, and he might pass on some of this skill to his offspring.

Logical equivalence

In logic and mathematics, two statements are logically equivalent if they can prove each other (under a set of axioms), or have the same truth value under all circumstances. In propositional logic, two statements are logically equivalent precisely when their truth tables are identical. To express logical equivalence between two statements, the symbols formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3are often used.

For example, the statements ""A" and "B"" and ""B" and "A"" are logically equivalent. If "P" and Q are logically equivalent, then the statement ""P" if and only if "Q"" is a tautology.

Christopher Poole

Christopher Poole (born ), known online as moot, is an American Internet entrepreneur. He was born in New York City. He is best known for founding the anonymous English-language imageboard 4chan in October 2003. He served as the site's head administrator for more than 11 years before stepping down in January 2015. In 2016, he began working for Google. As of 2018, he works in the company's Google Maps division, based in Tokyo.

In April 2009, Poole was voted the world's most influential person of 2008 by an open Internet poll conducted by "Time".

On September 12, 2009, Poole gave a talk on why 4chan has a reputation as a "Meme Factory" at the "Paraflows Symposium" in Vienna, Austria, which was part of the Paraflows 09 festival, themed Urban Hacking. In this talk, Poole mainly attributed this to the anonymous system, and to the lack of data retention on the site ("The site has no memory"). His talk was published in the academic reader "Mind and Matter: Comparative Approaches towards Complexity" (edited by Günther Friesinger, Johannes Grenzfurthner, Thomas Ballhausen).

On February 10, 2010, Poole spoke at the TED2010 conference in Long Beach, California. He spoke about the increasing prevalence of persistent user identities and the sharing of personal information on sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and he also spoke about the value of anonymous posting on sites such as 4chan. Fred Leal of the Brazilian newspaper "O Estado de S. Paulo" said his inclusion in the conference "indicates that something extraordinary is happening... [4chan] challenges every Internet convention: it is, alone, the antithesis of Google, social networking sites, and blogs."

In 2010, Poole was reported to have raised $625,000 to create a new online enterprise, Canvas. The website opened on January 31, 2011, and featured digitally modified images uploaded by users who are required to self-identify using Facebook Connect. The enterprise ran until January 2014 when Poole announced that Canvas, and its DrawQuest feature, would be going out of business.

In January 2015, Poole announced that he would be stepping down as the 4chan administrator. On January 23, he hosted a final Q&A with site users using the /qa/ board and YouTube to livestream. This marked the beginning of his "retirement" from being an administrator and owner of the website after eleven and a half years. He began a process of turning control of the site over to three anonymous 4chan moderators while searching for a buyer for the website. On September 21, 2015, it was announced that Hiroyuki Nishimura, founder of the Japanese BBS 2channel, would take over as the site's owner.

Russell's teapot is still used to talk about the existence of God.

Burden of proof (philosophy)

The burden of proof (Latin: onus probandi) is the job of a person who is involved in a debate to show proof for their claim. 

When people are in a discussion and one makes a claim that the other one does not agree with, the one who makes the claim has the burden "of proof". It means he must show proof of that claim, especially when it is controversial. 

Carl Sagan said that: "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" – which is known as the Sagan standard.

Often these philosophical debates moved from what the claim was to debating who has the "burden of proof" or the best proof for their claim.

The burden of proof also exclaims when the accuser makes an accusation, they have the burden of proof to prove that what they said is true with evidence.

Breadth-first search

In computer science, breadth-first search (BFS) is a method used for traversing a graph. It starts at any item you want to use as a starting position in a graph, and explores all of the neighbor items at the present depth before to moving on to the items at the next depth level. A breadth-first search done on a tree (data structure) is called a level-order traversal.

void breadthFirstSearch(Item root) {
Though they have usage in a variety of disciplines, breadth first search algorithms are most often associated with finding the shortest distance between two points, such as on a map. 


The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (movie)

Depth-first search

In computer science, depth-first search (DFS) is a method used for traversing a graph. It starts at an arbitrary item of a graph and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

void depthFirstSearch(Item root) {
An example: To make a program that searches all the files on your computer, it has to be able to keep track of which folders it has already searched through, so it doesn't look through the same folder twice. So it does this: inside each folder, it goes as far down into subfolders as it can. Every time it checks something to see if it matches, it will write it down on the list as "already searched". Then it will leave and go to the next subfolder. If there are no subfolders left, it will backtrack another step and look in the next bigger folder. It does this until it has looked through everything.
We know that this is the best way to make sure the search program looks through every folder and file once, and only once, because graph theory has proved it.

Johanna "Hannah" Arendt (14 October 1906 – 4 December 1975) was a German-born political philosopher. 

She was born in Hanover in western Germany but grew up largely in Königsberg in East Prussia.

Because of her Jewish background she fled from Nazi Germany in the 1930s, and settled in the United States in 1941 (she became an American citizen in 1950).

Arendt was also active as a journalist and a university professor. She didn't like to be called philosopher, and also didn't like the term political philosophy. In 1959, she was the first woman to teach at Princeton University.

Between 1963 and 1967 she taught at University of Chicago, and from 1975 at The New School, in New York. 

Arendt is best known for two major works that had a large impact: The first one is the book "The Origins of Totalitarianism" (published in 1951), which was a study of the Nazi and Stalin regimes. The second major work, "The Human Condition" (published in 1958), was a philosophical book on the human nature and human activities throughout Western history. Over the years, she published several influential essays on topics such as revolution, freedom, authority, tradition and the modern age.

In 1961, she attended the trial of Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann in Israel and wrote thereafter "Eichmann in Jerusalem" in 1963. In this book she launches the idea which she calls "the banality of evil": a person accused of terrible crimes did not perform these atrocities because of an immoral conviction but as an everyday person who 'did just his job'.

Hannah Arendt died at the age of 69 in her hometown New York City.

DiGeorge syndrome

DiGeorge syndrome, or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is a syndrome caused by the deletion of a small segment of chromosome 22. The symptoms are caused by the lack of those genes. 

The symptoms often include congenital heart problems, facial features, infections, developmental delay, learning problems and cleft palate. Other conditions include kidney problems, hearing loss and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or Graves disease.

DiGeorge syndrome is due to the deletion of 30 to 40 genes in the middle of chromosome 22 at a location known as "22q11.2". About 90% of cases occur due to a new mutation during early development, while 10% are inherited from a person's parents. 

The condition is autosomal dominant: only one affected chromosome is needed for the condition to occur. Diagnosis is suspected based on the symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.

Although there is no cure, treatment can improve symptoms. This often includes efforts to improve the function of the many organ systems involved. Long-term outcomes depend on the symptoms present and the severity of the heart and immune system problems. With treatment, life expectancy may be normal.

DiGeorge syndrome occurs in about 1 in 4,000 people. The syndrome was first described in 1968 by American physician Angelo DiGeorge. In late 1981, the underlying genetics were determined.

Arctic ice pack

The Arctic ice pack or arctic ice cap is an ice shield covering the Arctic Ocean. It changes during the year. Usually, the ice melts in spring and summer, and increases during autumn and winter. The minimum cover is around mid-September. Summer ice cover in the Arctic is about half of winter cover. Some of the ice survives from one year to the next. Currently, 28% of Arctic basin sea ice is multi-year ice. Multi-year ice is thicker than seasonal ice: up to thick over large areas, with ridges up to thick. As well as the regular seasonal cycle there has been an underlying trend of declining sea ice in the Arctic in recent decades.

Sea ice is important for the heat balance of the polar oceans: it insulates the (relatively) warm ocean from the much colder air above. With ice, less heat is lost from the oceans. Sea ice is highly reflective of solar radiation, reflecting about 60% of incoming solar radiation when bare and about 80% when covered with snow. This is due to a feedback known as the albedo effect. This is much greater than the reflectivity of the sea (about 10%). The ice also affects the absorption of sunlight at the surface.

The sea ice cycle is also an important source of dense (saline) bottom water. When sea water freezes it leaves most of its salt content behind. The remaining surface water, made dense by the extra salinity, sinks and produces dense water masses such as North Atlantic Deep Water. This production of dense water is essential in maintaining the thermohaline circulation, and the accurate representation of these processes is important in climate modelling.

The Odden ice tongue in the Greenland Sea is an area where so-called pancake ice is the most common type of ice. Odden means headland in Norwegian. During the winter, it grows eastward from the East Greenland ice edge around 72°N to 74°N. The Jan Mayen Current brings some very cold polar surface water, which it takes from the East Greenland Current. Most of the old ice continues south, driven by the wind, so a cold open water surface is exposed on which new ice forms as frazil and pancake in the rough seas.

Records of Arctic Sea ice from the United Kingdom's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research go back to the turn of the 20th century. Before 1950, the data is not as good as after 1950. Reliable measurements of sea ice edge begin within the satellite era. From the late 1970s, there were different satellites that could provide data which was independent of solar illumination or weather conditions. The frequency and accuracy of passive microwave measurements improved with the launch of the DMSP F8 Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSMI) in 1987. Both the sea ice area and extent are estimated. The latter is lager, as it is defined as the area of ocean with at least 15% sea ice.

A modeling study of the 52-year period from 1947 to 1999 found a statistically significant decrease in Arctic ice volume of 3% per decade, caused by an increase in tempertature. A computer-based, time-resolved calculation of sea ice volume, fitted to various measurements, revealed that monitoring the ice volume is much more important for evaluating sea ice loss than pure area considerations.

The trends from 1979 to 2002 have been a statistically significant Arctic sea ice decrease of 2.5% ± 0.9% per decade during those 23 years. Climate models simulated this trend in 2002. The September minimum ice extent trend for 1979–2011 declined by 12.0% per decade during 32 years. In 2007 the minimum extent fell by more than a million square kilometers, the biggest decline since accurate satellite data has been available, to . New research shows the Arctic Sea ice to be melting faster than predicted by any of the 18 computer models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in preparing its 2007 assessments. In 2012, a new record low of about was reached.

In the overall mass balance, the volume of sea ice depends on the thickness of the ice as well as the area covered. While the satellite era has enabled better measurement of trends in area, accurate ice thickness measurements remain a challenge. "Nonetheless, the extreme loss of this summer’s sea ice cover and the slow onset of freeze-up portends lower than normal ice extent throughout autumn and winter, and the ice that grows back is likely to be fairly thin". As more and more of the sea ice is thinner first-year ice the greater effect storms have on its stability with turbulence resulting from major extratropical cyclones resulting in extensive fractures of sea ice.

Notes on Nationalism

Notes on Nationalism is a well-known essay written by George Orwell. Orwell wrote the essay in May 1945, in a journal called "Polemic", after the Second World War had ended. In the essay, Orwell describes his idea of nationalism as:

Here, he links nationalism to political power, influence and factionalism. He says "nationalism" is not the same as "patriotism", as patriotism ""is of its nature defensive... Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable (hard to separate) from the desire for power.""

He says that it can be "positive," i.e. "for" something, such as one's country. Orwell says Celtic nationalism and Zionism are examples of this sort of nationalism. On the other hand, it can be "negative", i.e. "against" something, such as another group. Orwell says Anti-Soviet Trotskyism ans Antisemitism are examples of this sort.

"Transferred nationalism" is a third kind. This is identification and promotion of a different race, social class, or country to your own.

Orwell's claim that only Scottish nationalists think that using the Lowland Scottish language is important has been criticised by speakers of the language.

Orwell's "Notes on Nationalism" have been used by people on the right-wing of Scottish politics (such as former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson) to argue against 'identity politics'.

After the sixty seconds, the players pass their books to the player on their left. On page two, the players guess what was drawn on page one of the book that was passed to them. When all players have written their guesses, they turn their books to page three and again pass their books to the left. Players draw and guess until they have their original books back.

The players then take turns revealing what was drawn and guessed in their books, then award points. Each player awards: 

The player with the most points after three rounds wins the game.

Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen

Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen (13 August 1792 – 2 December 1849) was the wife of King William IV of the United Kingdom. She was the daughter of George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, and Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

Adelaide was born on 13 August 1792 at Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany. She was the first child of George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and Luise Eleonore. At her baptism, she had twenty-one godparents, including:

On 11 July 1818, Adelaide married Prince William, Duke of Clarence. It was a double wedding with William's younger brother, Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. When they married, William was second in line for the throne. He became first in line when his brother, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, died in 1827. William and Adelaide became King and Queen of the United Kingdom when William's older brother, king George IV died in 1830.

William and Adelaide were King and Queen until William died in 1837. Adelaide died on 2 December 1849, aged 57.

The following are some of the things named after Adelaide:

Spinal stenosis

Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal or neural foramen. It can cause pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots. 

Symptoms may include pain, numbness, or weakness in the arms or legs.

Symptoms usually get worse over time. Severe symptoms may include bladder and bowel problems or sexual dysfunction.

Sexual dysfunction

Sexual dysfunction is a medical problem in which a person or a couple have problems during any stage of sex, This can make it hard for them to have an arousal or orgasm. 

Sexual dysfunction happens when a person feels extremely uncomfortable for a minimum of six months. Sexual dysfunctions can have a profound impact on an individual's perceived quality of sexual life.

There are certain drugs that change the ways hormones are processed. These drugs can also lead to a sexual dysfunction. These drugs are used to treat symptoms such as depression.

Designated Player Rule

The Designated Player Rule, nicknamed the Beckham Rule, allows Major League Soccer franchises to sign up to three players that would be considered outside their salary cap (either by offering the player higher wages or by paying a transfer fee for the player). The rule was adopted ahead of the 2007 MLS season, and it enables teams to compete for star players in the international soccer market. The rule is one of two ways which MLS teams may exceed their salary cap, the other being allocation money. As of December 2019, there have been 209 Designated Players in league history.

The rule is named after David Beckham. Beckham was the first player signed under this rule, signing a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy with a guaranteed annual salary of $6.5 million.

Notes


Geometric distribution

In probability, the geometric distribution with probability of success formula_1, written formula_2, is a discrete probability distribution defined on non-negative integers. It is used to model the number of trials needed to obtain a first success, where the probability of success of each trial is formula_1.

An example involving geometric distribution is the number of times a coin needs to be tossed in order to get the first head.

The geometric distribution is the discrete analogue of the exponential distribution.

Charlotte Forman

Charlotte Forman (1715–1787) was a journalist, translator, political essayist and activist. Between 1756 and 1780, she wrote political essays and news from abroad for newspapers under pseudonyms (false names). The false name she used in the newspapers "Gazetteer" and "The Public Ledger" was "Probus".

She was not famous in her lifetime, but she has become more well known in recent years. This is because she was one of the few women at that time who wrote essays on politics and trade. Back then, people thought those were men's areas of interest. Because of sexism, most people thought Forman's essays were written by men.

Scholars say her essays show great knowledge and morality. 

Forman's father was Irish Jacobite Charles Forman, and her mother was called Mary. Forman had five brothers and sisters. 

Charles Forman was a clerk in the English war office. When James Francis Edward Stuart tried become king of England, Ireland and Scotland (and make royal House of Stuart the rulers of these countries) in the Jacobite rising of 1715, Forman was late in sending orders to the English general Charles Wills, who was fighting the Jacobites. Therefore, we do not know whether Charlotte was born in England or France, but she did later write that she had been "nursed in the palace of the Trianon" in France. 

She lived in London for most of her life in poverty, and went into debtors' prison for a short time in 1767.

Forman wrote a many political essays for the "Gazetteer" and "London Daily Advertiser" between 1756 and 1760, then carried in in the "Public Ledger" in 1760. Both newspapers were for merchants, traders, and shopkeepers in London, and had information about to international trade, such as news about shipping and offers of wholesale and retail goods..

Forman's essays in the "Gazetteer" and the "Public Ledger", all signed as Probus, were written in the before and during the Seven Years' War. About 200 surviving essays comment on diplomatic news and general news reports, as well as looking into the interests of England, Prussia, France, Holland, Austria, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark. She always supported the English war effort, and kept telling readers that England could defeat France, as well as defending Frederick the Great and William Pitt from critics. She also argued against an early peace, as she thought it would give France too much leeway.

Letters written between her and with Radical satirist and politician John Wilkes have beensaid to give modern readers "graphic evidence of the struggles of an independent woman in the 18th century attempting to support herself by writing". She said she was a literary day labourer.

She is not known to have published anything under her own name, although there are many works published anonymously which now cannot be attributed.

Aluminium-26

Aluminium-26 (Al, Al-26) is a radioactive isotope of aluminium. It decays by either positron emission or electron capture to magnesium-26. The half-life of Al is 7.17×10 years. A small amount of aluminium-26 is made when atoms hit cosmic ray protons.

When aluminium-26 decays it also produces gamma rays and x-rays. Because it is radioactive, it is usually kept behind at least 5 centimetres (2 in) of lead. We use special tools to transfer, use, and store aluminium-26.

Stellar nucleosynthesis

Stellar nucleosynthesis is the creation (nucleosynthesis) of chemical elements by nuclear fusion reactions in stars. This fusion reaction also creates the stars' light and heat. The theory was proposed by Fred Hoyle in 1946. Stars evolve because of changes in what they are made up of throughout their life. However, this does not by itself change the amount of elements in the universe. Later in its life, a low-mass star will slowly release its atmosphere through solar wind, forming a planetary nebula. A high-mass star will release mass through a supernova.

Hydrogen fusion is the main process that makes energy in main sequence stars. Stars of all masses start on the main sequence. Hydrogen fusion combines four protons, which are hydrogen-1 nuclei, to make a helium-4 nucleus. In doing this, the star must convert two protons into neutrons.

Less massive stars, such as the Sun, use the "proton-proton chain reaction". It starts with a collision of two protons. One of them becomes a neutron (after it releases a positively-charged positron). This creates a hydrogen-2 nucleus. Next, it collides with another proton to make a helium-3 nucleus. Finally, two helium-3 nuclei collide. This releases two protons and creates a stable helium-4 nucleus.

More massive stars use the "CNO cycle" to make helium-4. It starts with a carbon-12 nucleus. Four protons hit it, one at a time. Two of them become neutrons. Then the nucleus splits apart into a helium-4 nucleus and a carbon-12 nucleus, so the cycle can keep going. Of course, this is only possible if there is already carbon-12 in the star.

Helium fusion combines three helium-4 nuclei into carbon-12. If two helium-4 nuclei collide, the resulting nucleus will decay very quickly. So three helium-4 nuclei must collide at almost the same time.

A helium-4 nucleus is also called an alpha particle, so this process is called the "triple-alpha process".

Helium fusion requires higher temperature and pressure than hydrogen fusion. It can happen in all but the smallest stars. Helium fusion starts when the core runs out of hydrogen. When hydrogen fusion stops, the core stops making heat and light. Gravity collapses the core, making it smaller. This creates enough pressure and heat for helium fusion. The helium fusion makes the star much bigger. It becomes a red giant or red supergiant.

In the alpha process, helium-4 nuclei collide with larger nuclei. This creates oxygen, neon, magnesium, and larger elements. It requires higher temperature and pressure than helium fusion. This requirement gets even higher as nuclei get larger. It will not happen in the Sun, but in much more massive stars.

The alpha process creates elements up to iron (atomic number 26). It creates nuclei whose mass numbers are multiples of 4.

In the s-process and r-process, large nuclei collide with neutrons. Sometimes, a nucleus will then go through beta decay, and a neutron will change into a proton. The "s" stands for "slow", because it happens more slowly, when less neutrons are nearby. It can happen inside red giant stars. The "r" stands for "rapid", because it happens more quickly, when more neutrons are nearby. The r-process can happen in a supernova. These are an important source of rare, heavy elements.

Eye of the Tiger

"Eye of the Tiger" is a 1982 hard rock song under the American rock band Survivor. This rock ballad was from the hard rock studio album of the same name. It was recorded under the request of the actor Sylvester Stallone for his boxing drama movie "Rocky III". That happened when rock group Queen didn't give him permission to use the song "Another One Bites the Dust" in his movie. The movie version had tiger growls within it.

In the United States, "Eye of the Tiger" hit #1 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100. It stayed at #1 for six weeks.

The song was nominated for a 1982 Academy Award for Best Original Song. This was the only nomination for "Rocky III". It lost to "Up Where We Belong" from "An Officer and a Gentleman". It was also nominated for a 1983 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. It lost, though, to Willie Nelson's hit "Always on My Mind".

In 2012, Survivor sued Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich in Illinois federal court. Gingrich had been using "Eye of the Tiger" without asking permission in his political rallies dating back to 2009.

Operation Amsterdam

Merge sort

Merge sort (or mergesort) is an divide and conquer algorithm for sorting a list of items. John von Neumann first presented it in 1945. It is similar to quicksort, developed in 1960. The difference is that with merge sort, dividing the lists is trivial, and merging them together isn't. With quicksort, dividing the lists is more complex, but the merging step is trivial.

Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, while quicksort is not. It has a worst-case complexity of O(n*log(n)). Merge sort is also highly parallelizable. It can be used for solving the inversion counting problem.


Stable sorting algorithm

A sorting algorithm is called stable if it preserves the order of elements with the same sorting key. Otherwise it is called unstable.
Merge sort is an example of a stable sorting algorithm, quicksort is an example of an unstable sorting algorithm. 
Note that being stable has nothing to do with how difficult it is to do the sorting (known as complexity). Bubble sort is very easy to implement, but takes a very long time. It is a stable sorting algorithm.
Heapsort is very efficient, but it is not stable.
Formally stability may be defined as, how the algorithm treats equal elements. Let A[] be an array, and let ‘<‘ be a strict weak ordering on the elements of A[]. A sorting algorithm is stable if: i < j and A[i]=A[j] implies pi(i) < pi(j) where pi is the sorting permutation (sorting moves A[i] to position pi(i)).
Which sorting algorithms are stable? 

Some Sorting Algorithms are stable by nature, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Count Sort, etc.

Which sorting algorithms are unstable? 

Quick Sort, Heap Sort etc., can be made stable by also taking the position of the elements into consideration. This change may be done in a way that does not compromise a lot on the performance and takes some extra space.

Larchmont is a village located within the Town of Mamaroneck in Westchester County, New York, approximately northeast of Midtown Manhattan. The population of the village was 6,630 at the 2020 census.

Heapsort

Heap sort or heapsort is a sorting algorithm. It was presented in 1964, and helped make a data structure known as heap popular. Heapsort divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. It then takes the largest element from the unsorted region and inserts it into the sorted region. The unsorted region is kept as a heap, which allows finding the largest element quickly. Heapsort is not stable. It has a worst-case complexity of O(n*log(n)).

Axion

An axion is a elementary particle theorized in 1977 by the Peccei–Quinn theory. It was used to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). If these axions do exist in a specific mass range, they could be a possible part of cold dark matter. There is also evidence of solar axions (axions from the Sun). Also if these axions exist there is evidence that they can go faster than the speed of light.

Beryllium-10

Beryllium-10 (Be) is a radioisotope of beryllium. It is formed in the Earth's atmosphere mainly by cosmic ray spallation of nitrogen and oxygen. Beryllium-10 has a half-life of 1.39 × 10 years. It decays by beta decay to boron-10. It has a maximum energy of 556.2 keV. It decays through the reaction Be→B + e.

Be and its daughter product have been used to study soil erosion, soil formation from regolith, the development of lateritic soils and the age of ice cores. It is also formed in nuclear explosions by a reaction of fast neutrons with C in the carbon dioxide in air.

Planetary differentiation

In planetary science, planetary differentiation is the process of separating out different parts of a planetary body where the planetary body develops into distinct layers. The denser materials of a planet sink to the center, while less dense materials rise to the surface. Such a process usually creates a core and mantle. Sometimes a crust forms on top of the mantle. The process of planetary differentiation has happened on planets, dwarf planets, the asteroid 4 Vesta, and natural satellites (such as the Moon).

Callus

A callus is an area of thick skin that forms due to pressure, friction or irritation. Repeated contact is needed for them to form. Calluses are often found on one's feet because of walking and badly fitting shoes. Though they may appear unsightly, calluses are not usually harmful. They can, however, lead to or cause other problems if neglected.

Calluses can also form on human hands. In particular, the middle, ring and index fingers are prone to calluses.

Construction work, having high heels on too much, rock climbing and playing musical instruments can cause calluses on the hands or feet. Certain sports can also cause calluses.

Reichsbürger movement

There are several groups of people who think that the modern German state is not legitimate. These movements are generally known as the Reichsbürger (English: "Reich" citizen) movement. A single person with such views is called a Reichsbürger. They argue that the the modern German state is not legitimate and its laws do not apply to them. Very often, these groups are very small. They often have several properties of a religious cult or sect. The ideas these groups propagate are often against democracy, and instead want a monarchy or another state with a strong leader. Very often, they also think that the history they were taught in school did not happen that way. From their ideas, these groups are usually far-right on the political spectrum. Their views are often anti-Semitic (anti-Jewish) and some are Holocaust deniers. 

"Reichsbürger" say that the German Reich still exists in some form (in reality, it ceased to exist with the end of World War I or World War II at the latest). According to these groups, there is some secret government which holds most of the powers. The respective group is usually part of that government. These movements first arose in the 1980s. Since about 2013, they are more active. They usually have some militant groups that do not fear to use violence. In 2020, there were over 19,000 people with sympathies for these movements.
