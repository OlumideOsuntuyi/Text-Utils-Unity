Military dictatorship in Brazil

The military dictatorship in Brazil () was created on 1 April 1964, after a coup d'état by the Brazilian Armed Forces, with support from the United States government against President João Goulart. 

The Brazilian dictatorship lasted for 21 years, until 15 March 1985. The military coup was led by José de Magalhães Pinto, Adhemar de Barros, and Carlos Lacerda, then governors of the states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Guanabara.

The coup was planned and started by commanders of the Brazilian Army and had the support of almost all high-ranking members of the military, along with the Catholic Church and anti-communists. It was supported by the State Department of the United States through its embassy in Brasilia.

The dictatorship censored all media, and tortured and exiled dissidents (person who challenges doctrines actively). João Figueiredo became president in March 1979; in the same year he passed the Amnesty Law for political crimes committed for and against the regime. 

Brazil's military government was a model for other military governments in South America and Latin America. In 2014, nearly 30 years after the regime fell, the Brazilian military recognized for the first time the torture and murder of political dissidents. In May 2018, the United States government released a memorandum, written by Henry Kissinger, confirming that the leadership of the Brazilian military regime was fully aware of the killing of dissidents. It is said that 434 people were either confirmed killed or went missing and 20,000 people were tortured during the military dictatorship in Brazil. 

President João Figueiredo eventually pushed the country back to democracy and supported the transfer of power to civilian rule. In 1981 the Congress enacted a law on restoration of direct elections of state governors. Tancredo Neves was elected by an electoral college to replace Figueiredo in 1984.

Free Association of Austrian Amateur Football Clubs

The Freie Vereinigung der Amateur-Fußballvereine Österreichs (VAFÖ) (Free Association of Austrian Amateur Football Clubs) was an Austrian football association. It existed from July 1926 to October 1936. It saw itself as the governing body for all Austrian workers' sports clubs. It was made directly from the Austrian Football Association (ÖFV). They had its own selection team. The team represented Austria in international workers' sports tournaments. 
After the First World War, the workers' sports clubs, workers' cyclists and nature lovers came together in 1919 to form the "Association of Workers' and Soldiers' Sports Clubs" (VAS), which in 1924 was renamed the "Workers' Federation for Sports and Physical Culture in Austria" (ASKÖ). Only the workers' footballers remained in the non-partisan Austrian Football Association (ÖFV) until 1926. From 1921 onward there were two interest groups within the ÖFV, the social-democratic “Free Association” and the bourgeois “Protection Association”.

There was a split over the question of whether the association should send a team to the first Workers' Olympics. The Free Association left the ÖFV and formed on 7 March 1926 the "Freie Vereinigung der Amateur-Fußballvereine Österreichs" (VAFÖ) . On July 1st the VAFÖ went one step further. It was decided to liquidate the association with the bourgeoisie and joined the ASKÖ. The other teams formed the "Allgemeinen Österreichischen Fußball-Bund" (AÖFB).

The VAFÖ then focused on the promotion of workers' football on an amateur base. They played own championships and cup competitions. They also formed an amateur selection. It represented Austria with great success in international workers' tournaments (Olympic champion 1931, European champion 1933). In 1927 the VAFÖ had 403 clubs with around 10.000 members.

Due to the poor economic situation, many players went to professional clubs in the early 1930s. After the Austrian Civil War in 1934 and the ban of the Social Democratic Party most of the VAFÖ teams were forced to the AÖFB. The football association existed till 1936 but had no influence.

PBS acquired a 51% majority stake in its own company from General Electric in January 2011, and would assume full ownership of the company in 2013. As a result, PBS media's interest in PBS Kids Sprout was turned over to the company. Apax Partners sold HIT Entertainment to Mattel on October 24, 2011; the sale did not include HIT's stake in PBS KIDS Sprout, which was retained by Apax Partners. On July 10, 2010, both PBS Kids Sprout and PBS Kids together began to produce the second educational children's programming block for NBC, branded as "NBC Kids" respectively. The block replaced Qubo (a previous joint venture between NBCUniversal, Ion Media, Corus Entertainment, Scholastic, and Classic Media), which had been airing on NBC and Telemundo since September 2006.

In December 2012, Sesame Workshop sold its interest in PBS Kids Sprout to American Public Television. On March 19, 2013, American Public Television acquired the remaining 49% of PBS Media it did not already own, and concurrently acquired Apax's stake in PBS KIDS Sprout. American Public Television then acquired it's sister partner PBS's share in PBS KIDS Sprout on November 13, 2013, giving it full ownership. As a result, the network's operations were brought under the PBS Media Group, and the "PBS KIDS" branding is still not removed (thus officially still has its name of "PBS KIDS Sprout"). 

Under PBS Media ownership, PBS Kids Sprout began to increase its investments in original programming to better compete with Disney Junior and the Nick Jr. Channel, with a goal to double its original series output to at least 30% of its schedule by the end of 2015, and displace older and non-exclusive library content in favor of original series and acquisitions exclusive to the channel. PBS Kids Sprout programs such as The Chica Show also earned increased visibility airing on NBC as part of the NBC Kids block.

On April 7, 2015, PBS KIDS Sprout underwent a brand refresh to mark the tenth anniversary of its launch, with new on-air imaging inspired by modern technology and mobile devices, a new tiny house-inspired studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza for its hosted morning block The Sunny Side Up Show, as well as the premiere of Nina's World—an original animated series spun off from its evening block The Good Night Show. Actress Alyssa Milano began to make appearances in interstitial segments as PBS KIDS Sprout's "Mom-bassador", with a particular focus on the channel's public service campaign "Kindness Counts".

The network's heads Paula Kerger and Sandy Wax stated that PBS KIDS Sprout also planned to experiment with more half-hour programs, and commission programming with more "complex stories" that can appeal better to older preschool audiences.

The band's current members are guitarist Vernon Reid, lead singer Corey Glover, drummer Will Calhoun and bassist Doug Wimbish. Many of the band's songs talk about racism in the United States.

They won another Grammy Award for their second album, "Time's Up". The band broke up in 1995, but came back together in 2000. Since then, they have released three albums. The band is working on making new music for another album.

Guitarist Vernon Reid made Living Colour in New York in 1984. Because he was born in England, he used the word 'colour' instead of 'color'. Reid was well known in New York's jazz music community because he played music with Ronald Shannon Jackson. From 1984 to 1986, Living Colour had many different members. These members were musicians such as Jerome Harris, Geri Allen and Pheeroan akLaff.

The band had many different singers. Sometimes, Reid would sing as well. During this time, the band made music that sounded very different than its studio albums. The band made a song named "Funny Vibe". This song would be put on "Vivid" in 1988.

In 1986, the band had four members: singer Corey Glover, guitarist Vernon Reid, bassist Muzz Skillings, and drummer Will Calhoun. These members stayed in the band. The band got good at playing at concerts. They played many times at CBGB, a club in New York City. Mick Jagger, the singer for the Rolling Stones, noticed the band. After he watched the band play at CBGB, he helped the band make demos of their music. He also helped the band join Epic Records, a record label. The band made their first album with Epic.

"Vivid" was released on May 3, 1988. It started selling many copies later that year. This was because MTV started showing the music video for "Cult of Personality", a song from the album. It reached number 6 on the "Billboard" 200, an American music chart. In 1989, the band played on "Saturday Night Live". "Cult of Personality" later won a Grammy Award.

Living Colour started going on concert tours with other bands, such as Guns N' Roses and the Rolling Stones. In 1990, the band released "Time's Up", their second album. It had music of many different genres, such as jazz, punk rock, hip hop, and funk. It won a Grammy Award. In 1991, Living Colour played at Lollapalooza.

In 1992, Skillings left the band. He was replaced by Doug Wimbish. The band made "Stain", their third album. In 1995, the band disbanded.

Amalek

Amalek was a nation in the Torah and Old Testament whose people called the Amalekites were enemies of the Israelites.

In the Book of Genesis, Chapter 36 Verse 10, Esau married a woman named Ada and she gave birth to a son named Eliphaz. Then in Chapter 36 Verse 12, Eliphaz had a concubine named Timna and she gave birth to a son named Amalek.

In the Book of Exodus Chapter 17, Amalek’s descendants called the Amalekites attacked the Israelites after the Israelites left Egypt. So Moses sent Joshua to fight the Amalekites. As long as Moses held his hands in the air, the Israelites were winning but Moses’s hands got tired so he got his brother Aaron to hold one up while Hur held the other up. And Joshua beat the Amalekites. 

Then in the Book of Exodus Chapter 17 Verse 14, the Lord told Moses “write this for a memorial in the book and recount it in the hearing of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven”.

In the Book of Numbers, King Balak of Moab hired Balaam to curse the Israelites but Balaam ended up blessing the Israelites instead. And when Balaam had a vision of the future of the Israelites and their victory over their enemies, he said “ Amalek was the first of the nations but his end shall come to destruction” (Numbers 24:20).

In the Book of Deuteronomy, Chapter 25, the Lord tells the Israelites to “remember what Amalek did to you on the way as you were coming out of Egypt” that the Amalekites attacked the Israelites from behind and killed the tired and weak. And because of it, the Lord tells the Israelites to “blot out the remembrance of Amalek from beneath heaven. You shall not forget.”

In the first Book of Samuel, Chapter 15, the Lord told Samuel to tell Saul to kill all Amalekites and destroy all of their property and kill all their animals because it was something that the Lord told the Israelites to do back in the time of Moses. But when Saul attacked Amalek, he captured King Agag instead of killing him and Saul and his warriors kept the best animals for themselves but “everything despised and worthless that they utterly destroyed” (1 Samuel 15:9). So the Lord sent Samuel to King Saul to tell him “now the Lord sent you on a mission and said “go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are exterminated. Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord?”. (1 Samuel 15:18-19). When Saul said that he killed the Amalekites except for their king and was actually going to sacrifice their animals to the Lord, Samuel told him
“Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord. Behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to heed than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He has also rejected you from being king.” 

Then Samuel told Saul to bring the Amalekite King Agag to him and Saul did. And Saul told Agag “As your sword has made women childless so shall your mother be childless among women” and cut Agag to pieces. (1 Samuel 15:33)

Later on in the first of the Books of Samuel, David fights the Amalekites.

In the second book of Samuel, a man told David that he is the son of an Amalekite and that he happened to be on Mount Gilboa after the battle. The man said that Saul asked him who he was and he told him “an Amalekite”. The Amalekite said that Saul asked him to kill him so that the Philistines couldn’t torture him and he killed Saul. David said the man was a murderer because he killed the King of Israel so David cut his head off. 

In the Books of Chronicles, there is a family tree which says that Esau became the father of Eliphaz and Eliphaz became the father of Amalek.

Agag

Agag was the name of a person in the Tanakh and Old Testament who was a king of Amalek.

In the Book of Numbers, Balaam has a prophecy predicting the victory of the Israelites over their enemies. In it, Balaam says “Their king will be greater than Agag, their kingdom will be exalted”. (Numbers 24:7) 

In the Books of Samuel, Saul chooses not to kill King Agag of the Amalekites and takes him prisoner instead so the Lord sends Samuel to Saul to tell him that he will no longer be king of Israel because he is being punished for not killing Agag. Saul then kills Agag by cutting him to pieces at Gilgal.

So Haman convinced King Ahaseurus to give him the power to make his own laws as if he were the king. Haman then started casting lots called Purim to figure out when to kill the Jews. Queen Esther then invited Ahaseurus and Haman to a feast and asked them to go to another one after it. Haman noticed that Mordechai still wouldn’t bow to him and complained about it to his wife Zeresh so Zeresh told Haman to build a gallows to hang Mordechai. Haman built the gallows but then Ahaseurus rewarded Mordechai for saving his life by forcing Haman to lead Mordechai across town on a horse shouting “so shall be done for the man whom the king wishes to honour”. Then Esther told Ahaseurus that she was secretly a Jew and Haman wanted to kill her and all her tribe. So Ahaseurus had Haman hanged on the same gallows Haman had built to hang Mordechai.

Ahaseurus does but he wants to get a new wife and ends up marrying Esther She opts not to disclose to him that she is. Jewish because Mordechai told her it would be dangerout if anyone knew. Esther then warned Ahaseurus that his servants Bigtan and Teresh were trying to poison him so Ahaseurus had them executed. Esther told Ahaseurus that Mordechai was the one who told her about the plan. Ahaseurus made Haman his advisor and gave him the power to make his own laws as if he were the king. When Esther came to Ahaseurus without an invitation, a crime punishable by death, Ahaseurus let her and gave her the feast she asked for with Haman there too. Then Ahaseurus remembered that he did nothing to reward Mordechai for saving him so he had Haman take him on a horse across the city saying “this shall be done for the man whom the king wishes to honour”. At the second feast, Esther told Ahaseurus that she was a Jew and that Haman wanted to kill her and her people. While Ahaseurus’s servant Charbonnah told Ahaseurus that Haman was planning to kill Mordechai. So Ahaseurus had Haman hanged on the gallows Haman had built to kill Mordechai and gave Mordechai Haman’s job. Moredechai and Esther asked Ahaseurus to cancel the law Haman had made and Ahaseurus told them that he couldn’t so he instead gave Mordechai the same power he had given Haman so Mordechai could give the Jews the right of self-defence so that they could use violence to fight back against and kill their enemies on the day Haman had chosen for the Jews to die.

Ayo Oritsejafor

Ayodele Joseph Oritsegbubemi Oritsejafor, known as Papa Ayo Oritsejafor, is the founding and Senior pastor of Word of Life Bible Church, located in Warri, Nigeria. He became the national president of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) on 7 February 2005, a position he held for five years.
In July 2010, Oritsejafor was elected president of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the umbrella body of all Christians in the country. In doing so he became the first Pentecostal leader to hold the position.
Oritsejafor was the first to launch a Miracle crusade from Africa to a world audience through satellite in 1987 with evangelist Joe Martins.
Ayo Oritsejafor was born on November 10 into the family of Mr. Joseph Monday Oritsejafor and Mrs. Roli Durojaiye Oritsejafor in Lagos, Nigeria.

In 1972, Oritsejafor became "born again" in an evangelical crusade held in Sapele, Nigeria. Oritsejafor enrolled at the All Nations For Christ Bible Institute, Benin City, Nigeria.

Oritsejafor further enrolled with the Nigerian Baptist Seminary, Ogbomosho in Oyo State, Nigeria and later went in 1979 to the United States for further studies at Morris Cerullo's School of Ministry (El Cortez), San Diego, California.

According to him, he had a vision of himself wearing a suit and was preaching to thousands of people and he heard a voice that said to him, "This is what you are going to be doing the rest of your life" and the voice said, "Take my word to the world". This is the inaugural vision that led to the founding of the Word of Life Bible Church (WLBC) in November 1987. He hosts Hour of Deliverance, a television program which had its debut in 1980.

Oritsejafor says he owes all his life's accomplishments to God, and his success in ministry he attributes to the influence of God-given mentors like Archbishop Benson Idahosa, Dr. Moris Cerullo, Evangelist Robert W. Schamback, and Evangelist Tommy L. Osborn among others.

Oritsejafor is a promoter of leadership by example. This is evident in the role he played in bringing the crisis in Niger Delta area of Nigeria to an end.
Oritsejafor sees himself as a servant of God and an instrument through which God ministers to the spiritual and physical needs of people.
He places emphasis on salvation, repentance, holiness, deliverance and empowerment of the less privileged, through social responsibility programmes. Over the years, he has condemned wastefulness and encouraged giving back to the society, regardless of religion or race.
He offers scholarships to students in need in various tertiary, secondary and elementary institutions both within and outside Nigeria irrespective of tribe or denomination.

In December 2005, Oritsejafor and his wife Helen partnered with Flight Micro Finance Bank to start an empowerment programme for the people. Oritsejafor, ever since, makes it a tradition to empower the less privileged and to reduce the sufferings of families all over at the end of every December.

On 26 December 2016, the Word of Life Bible Church in conjunction with the Eagle Flight Micro Finance Bank held the poverty alleviation programme in Warri.

On 23 May 2020, Oritsejafor and his wife Helen gave out some food items to the people "in order to cushion the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the masses".

A hologram of Pop Smoke performing "Dior" on stage had its debut at the Yard Club in Paris, France, in February of the following year, not long after he died.

"HipHopDX" writer Bernadette Giacomazzo stated with upbeat sounds on "Meet the Woo 2", Pop Smoke's "raw growling" was shocking and loud, but thought it was also effective. Erin Lowers for "Exclaim!" said that even though the sound of Pop Smoke's voice was already unique to set him apart from other musicians from New York, he said the record "feels timely," and there is "energy" felt in his songs that keep the listener hooked. He declared that "Meet the Woo 2" would allow people to remember his personality forever. Fred Thomas of AllMusic mentioned it has "unrelentingly raw energy" that makes it one Pop Smoke's best mixtapes. He claimed that each song on the mixtape is filled with pleasure and disaster and is loaded with the "same tension that fills the room right before a fight breaks out. " He says in his conclusion that Pop Smoke made something that is "exhilaratingly bleak" and "always ready to explode".

In a less positive review, Steve "Flash" Juon of "RapReviews" mentioned that the mixtape "regretfully" did not meet his expectations. He said that as a lyricist, Pop Smoke was "'just there' – not terrible, not brilliant, just okay." He did, however, say that "Meet the Woo 2" showed that Pop Smoke had future potential. Writing for "NME", Kyann-Sian William said the mixtape features "slightly lackluster" songs, commenting that when A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie raps on "Foreigner", he gives a "sloppy delivery" and thought the song should not be on the mixtape. Although, she said the mixtape was for "the mosh-pitting party-goers". Reed Jackson of "Pitchfork" said while "Meet the Woo 2" is "all sort of sounds like 'Party'", it did not get the same attention as his first mixtape "Meet the Woo" because of its production and sound.

With sales of 36,000 album-equivalent units, including 5,000 pure album sales in its first week, "Meet the Woo 2" debuted at number seven on the US "Billboard" 200 dated February 22, 2020, giving Pop Smoke his first top-10 hit in the United States. The mixtape also peaked at number five on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for having sold more than 500,000 album-equivalent units in the United States.

On the February 14, 2020, edition of the UK Albums Chart, "Meet the Woo 2" debuted at number 22. The mixtape received attention following Pop Smoke's murder and reached number 16 on the chart for the week ending February 28, 2020, giving the rapper his first top-20 success in the United Kingdom. For sales of 100,000 album-equivalent units in the United Kingdom, the British Phonographic Industry certified the mixtape silver.

Thousand Days' War

The Thousand Days War was a civil war in Colombia which was fought from October 17th 1899 to November 21st 1902. It was fought over whether Colombia should have federalism or centralism.

In 1863, Colombia got a Constitution giving the people freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to own guns. It also gave Colombia a system of federalism and the separation of church and state. 

In 1884, Rafael Núñez was elected president of Columbia and wanted to get rid of federalism and get rid of the separation of church and state and get rid of secularism and used the slogan “one nation, one goal, one God”. When Núñez retired, his Vice President Miguel Antonio Caro took over as president. 

Caro used government censorship to stop criticism by banning newspapers which criticized him and had major politicians who opposed him arrested. Then the Colombian Liberal Party rebelled against him and he crushed three different rebellions. In 1894, the rebels attacked Caro’s government but in 1895 they surrendered.

In 1896, Caro quit being president after members of the Liberal Party asked that he lift martial law and in the next election in 1898, Manuel Antonio Saclemente won while 84 years old. Then in 1899, the Liberals attacked Santander to protest Saclemente’s policies and started a civil war. 

Between the 11th and 13th of November, 1899, the Battle of Bucaramanga killed 1000 people and injured 500. Soon the war spread to all of Colombia. In 1901, President Cipriano Castro of Venezuela sent his army to Colombia to help the Liberals. In 1902, General Uribe Uribe decided he couldn’t win and agreed to surrender. 

The American President Theodore Roosevelt sent his navy to protect the Panama Canal so after the two factions signed a treaty in Panama, they signed a second on an American ship which officially ended the war on the 21st of November, 1902. 

Gabriel Garcia Márquez wrote some novels about the war. The Disney movie Encanto is about a family of refugees from the war.

The Sandman (short story)

The Sandman (short story) is a short story by Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann, which he wrote in 1817. It's a science fiction horror story.

When he was a child, Nathaniel snuck out of his room at night and watched his father work with an alchemist named Coppelius on creating robots called automatons. When Nathaniel was scared and screamed, Coppelius decided to take his eyes out of his head and put them in an automaton but Nathaniel’s father stopped him so Nathaniel woke up thinking it was a nightmare. Years later a man named Coppola came to Nathaniel to sell him glasses and Nathaniel threatened to throw him out a window because he reminded him of Coppelius. Nathaniel wrote to his girlfriend Clara and her brother Lothar telling them what happened to him in his childhood but they think it's a false memory so Nathaniel breaks up with Clara. After Professor Spallanzani tells Nathaniel that Coppola comes from Italy and Coppelius is from Germany, Nathaniel buys a telescope from Coppola. Then Nathaniel sees Spallanzani’s daughter Olympia with the telescope and falls in love with her. Then Coppelius tears her human eyes out of her machine head and runs away as it turns out Olympia is an automaton. Nathaniel has a nervous breakdown and starts to have psychosis. After Nathaniel gets better he decides to marry Clara but then he sees Coppelius with the telescope and goes violently insane. Nathaniel kills himself and Coppelius tears his eyes out of his head and runs away laughing with them probably planning to use them when making new automatons.

Sigmund Freud wrote an essay on The Sandman in which he came up with the idea of the uncanny which is also the source of the idea of the uncanny valley.

Formula for primes

Willan's Formula is a formula that can find the "nth" prime number.

formula_1

Let's first start with the formula_2.

Wilson's theorem says if formula_3 is divisible by formula_4, than formula_4 is either a prime number or formula_6, meaning when formula_4 is prime, formula_2 is an integer.

It would be much easier if the formula gives a number instead of checking if the number is an integer, and we can do this with the formula_9 part.
The reason the formula has formula_10 multiplied by the formula_2 part is because when formula_2 is an integer, formula_13 will give formula_6 or formula_15. 

When squaring the result then formula_13 will equal formula_6 when formula_2 is an integer.

By flooring this, the only results are formula_6 when formula_2 is an integer and formula_21 when it isn't, leavingformula_9.
The formula_23 will add formula_6s for the primes formula_6 - formula_26 and and will sum up to the formula_27.

The formula_28 in short will give formula_6 if formula_30 and formula_21 when formula_32.
Take the formula_33 of both sides where formula_33 is the "nth" prime number:

formula_6 when formula_36 formula_37 formula_38 formula_39

formula_21 when formula_36 formula_42 formula_43 formula_39
formula_45 gives the number formula_15, and the formula_15 is because when formula_48 formula_39 reaches formula_50 formula_39, the function doesn't add 1. The formula adds up to formula_52 is because Bertrand's postulate says formula_52 is bigger than the "nth" prime number.
And finally, formula_6 is added because of the formula_15.

Bow shock

In astrophysics, a bow shock triggers when the magnetosphere of an astrophysical object interacts with the nearby flowing ambient plasma such as the solar wind. For Earth and other magnetized planets, it is the border at which the speed of the stellar wind suddenly drops as a result of its approach to the magnetopause. For stars, this border is usually the edge of the astrosphere, where the stellar wind meets the interstellar medium.

The defining judging requirement of a shock wave is that the bulk velocity (speed) of the plasma drops from "supersonic" to "subsonic", where the speed of sound c is defined by
formula_1
where formula_2 is the ratio of specific heats, formula_3 is the pressure, and formula_4 is the density of the plasma. 

A common difficulty in astrophysics is the presence of a magnetic field. For example, the charged particles making up the solar wind follow spiral paths along magnetic field lines. The velocity (speed) of each particle as it moves around a field line can be treated similarly to a thermal velocity in an ordinary gas, and in an ordinary gas the mean thermal velocity is about the speed of sound. At the bow shock, the bulk forward velocity of the wind (which is the part of the velocity parallel to the field lines about which the particles moving in a spiral path.) drops below the speed at which the particles are moving at a spiral path.

The best-studied example of a bow shock is that it occurs where the Sun's wind encounters Earth's magnetopause, although bow shocks occur around all planets, also unmagnetized, such as Mars and Venus and magnetized, such as Jupiter or Saturn. Earth's bow shock is about 17 kilometres thick and located about 90,000 km from the planet.

Bow shocks form at comets as a result of the interaction between the solar wind and the cometary ionosphere. Far away from the Sun, a comet is an icy boulder without an atmosphere. As it approaches the Sun, the heat of the sunlight causes gas to be released from the cometary nucleus, creating an atmosphere called a coma. The coma is partially ionized by the sunlight, and when the solar wind passes through this ion coma, the bow shock appears.

The first observations were made in the 1980s and 90s as several spacecraft flew by comets which were 21P/Giacobini–Zinner, Halley's Comet, and 26P/Grigg–Skjellerup. It was then found that the bow shocks at comets are wider and more gradual than the sharp planetary bow shocks seen at for example Earth. These observations were all made near perihelion when the bow shocks already were fully developed.

The Rosetta spacecraft followed comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko from far out in the solar system, at a distance of 3.6 AU from the Sun, in toward perihelion at 1.24 AU, and back out again. This allowed Rosetta to observe the bow shock as it formed when the outgassing increased during the comet's journey toward the Sun. In this early state of development the shock was called the "infant bow shock". The infant bow shock is asymmetric and, relative to the distance to the nucleus, wider than fully developed bow shocks.

For many decades, the solar wind has been thought to form a bow shock at the edge of the heliosphere, where it collides with the surrounding interstellar medium. Moving away from the Sun, the point where the solar wind flow becomes subsonic is the termination shock, the point where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance is the heliopause, and the point where the flow of the interstellar medium becomes subsonic would be the bow shock. This solar bow shock was thought to lie at a distance around 230 AU from the Sun, more than twice the distance of the termination shock as encountered by the Voyager spacecraft.

However, data obtained in 2012 from NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer Spacecraft indicates the lack of any solar bow shock. Along with present results from the Voyager spacecraft, these findings have motivated some theoretical improvement; current thinking is that formation of a bow shock is prevented, at least in the galactic region through which the Sun is passing, by a combination of the strength of the local interstellar magnetic-field and of the relative velocity of the heliosphere.

In 2006, a far infrared bow shock was detected near the AGB star, R Hydrae.
Bow shocks are also a common feature in Herbig Haro objects, in which a much stronger collimated outflow of gas and dust from the star interacts with the interstellar medium, producing bright bow shocks that are visible at optical wavelengths.

If a massive star is a runaway star, it can form an infrared bow-shock that is detectable in 24 μm and sometimes in 8μm of the Spitzer Space Telescope or the W3/W4-channels of the satelite, WISE. In 2016 Kobulnicky et al. did create the largest spitzer/WISE bow-shock catalog to date with 709 bow-shock candidates. To get a larger bow-shock catalog The Milky Way Project (a Citizen Science project) aims to map infrared bow-shocks in the galactic plane. This larger catalog will help to understand the stellar wind of massive stars.

The closest stars with bow-shocks are:
A similar effect, known as the magnetic draping effect, occurs when a super-Alfvenic plasma flow impacts an unmagnetized object such as what happens when the solar wind reaches the ionosphere of Venus: the flow deflects around the object draping the magnetic field along the wake flow.

The condition for the flow to be super-Alfvenic means that the relative velocity between the flow and object, formula_5, is larger than the local Alfven velocity formula_6 which means a large Alfvenic Mach number: formula_7. For unmagnetized and electrically conductive objects, the ambient field creates electric currents inside the object, and into the surrounding plasma, such that the flow is deflected and slowed as the time scale of magnetic dissipation is much longer than the time scale of magnetic field advection. The induced currents in turn generate magnetic fields that deflect the flow creating a bow shock. For example, the ionospheres of Mars and Venus provide the conductive environments for the interaction with the solar wind. Without an ionosphere, the flowing magnetized plasma is absorbed by the non-conductive body. The latter occurs, for example, when the solar wind interacts with Moon which has no ionosphere. In magnetic draping, the field lines are wrapped and draped around the leading side of the object creating a narrow sheath which is similar to the bow shocks in the planetary magnetospheres. The concentrated magnetic field increases until the ram pressure becomes comparable to the magnetic pressure in the sheath:

where formula_9 is the density of the plasma, formula_10 is the draped magnetic field near the object, and formula_11 is the relative speed between the plasma and the object. Magnetic draping has been detected around planets, moons, solar coronal mass ejections, and galaxies.

Diving at the 1922 Women's Olympiad – 5 metre platform

The 5 metre platform diving event at the 1922 Women's Olympiad was held on 22 April 1922. The venue of the competition was the Port Hercules, the harbour of Monte Carlo, Monaco. The 5 metre platform was part of the temporary scaffolding together with the 3 metre springboard.

Six divers from four nations entered for the 5 metre platform. This were the same six entrants as for the 3 metre springboard event.
The competition consisted of a total of six dives by each diver.

The diving competition was straight after the water polo match. The Dutch Truus Klapwijk, one of the main competitors who won the 3 metre springboard event the day before, withdrawn from the diving competition. She was too tired after having won the water polo competition.

The competition was won by the Swedish national diving champion Eva Olliwier, ahead of the other Swedish woman Hjördis Töpel. It was reported that the two Swedish women were much better compared to the other divers. The British Cecily O'Bryen finished third.

Wiener Bewegungsspieler

The Wiener Bewegungsspieler was a association football club from Austrias capital Vienna. In his most successful time between 1911 and 1928 they played 12 seasons in the second division.
The team was the football section of the "Teachers' sports association", which was founded in 1909. In the first league championship 1911/12, the club was ranked in the second class and was able to stay in the second tier until relegation in 1913/14. 

After the First World War, they were promoted again in 1919, and the following years of relegation battles finally came to an end in the 1923/24 season. They finished the second class in second place behind SC Rudolfshügel and also with the 2:1 victory in the ÖFB Cup over the first division team and runners-up this season, Vienna, made the headlines for the club.

When professionalism was introduced in 1924 they decided to continue playing in the second division. The club achieved good results, in the 1927/28 season they again finished second behind SC Nicholson Vienna. Due to the lack of money negotiations were held with SC Nicholson Vienna and Brigittenauer AC. With a purchase price of 3,000 schillings the club was sold which ment the end of the club.

Revolutions of 1989

The Revolutions of 1989 or the Fall of Communism were a series of revolutions against communist and socialist governments around the world, especially in Europe. It caused the end of the Cold War, saw the end of most communist states and the United States becoming the world's only superpower. It also caused the end of the Soviet Union due to the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. After the revolutions, the only remaining communist countries were China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam, however people in these countries did hold protests against the government (like the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China) and there were many reforms after 1991 (like "đổi mới" in Vietnam, which was similar to Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet Union, "glasnost" and "perestroika").

Outside Europe, communist and socialist governments in Africa, Asia and the Middle East also lost power in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, as did the short-lived People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada in 1983 (after the Americans invaded Grenada).

All of the republics of the Soviet Union except for Lithuania fully left the Soviet Union at some point in 1991; Lithuania left in 1990, making it the first to declare independence.

Principe scops owl

The Príncipe scops owl ("Otus bikegila") is a bird that lives on an island called Príncipe in São Tomé and Príncipe.

The owl lives in old-growth forests. There is about 15 square kilometers of old growth forest left on Principe, and about 1000-1500 Principe scops owls live there. Its call sounds like "tuu." They start calling as soon as the sun goes down.

Scientists thought this bird was there since 1928. They became pretty sure it was there in 1997. In July 2016, someone took a photograph of an unknown "Otus" owl on Príncipe. The image was published on Ornithomedia. People had heard Otus owls calling there since the early 1900s, but no one had been sure. In 2022, scientists caught a few owls and wrote the first formal paper describing it. They named it "Otus bikegila". In 2022, scientists wrote the first paper saying exactly what it looked like.

Scientists named this bird after a park ranger named Ceciliano do Bom Jesus. "Bikegila" is his nickname.

The scientists who wrote about the bird asked the IUCN to name it critically endangered because its home is so small and because human beings want to make a hydroelectric dam in part of the forest where it lives. As of 2022, the IUCN has not made a report on this bird yet.

Hyloscirtus diabolus

The Hyloscirtus diabolus is a frog. It lives in Peru. Scientists have seen it in exactly two places: cloud forests on the east side of the Corillera Central mountains.

This frog is large for a tree frog. Adults frogs can be 82.3–89.2 mm long from nose to rear end not counting the legs. This frog has thick, strong front legs. Scientists saw large vomerine teeth in its jaws. The skin of the back and sides is gray-brown or dark gray in color. There is some pink and orange color on the insides of the legs. The skin of the belly is red-gray in color. The climbing disks on the toes are brown in color. Sometimes there are tiny yellow spots on the toes. The iris of the eye is dark red in color.

The scientists named the frog "diabolus" after the Devil. Its strong front legs, gray skin, bumpy spine, large teeth, and especially its red eyes made it look fearsome to them. It reminded them of the way artists show the Devil.

Scops owl

Scops owls are owls in the family Strigidae. Scops owls are the genus Otus. They live in the Old World. "Otus" has more species in it than any other genus of owls. There are 59 species of scops owls. Scops owls are brown, grayish, or reddish in color, but they can have lighter colors on the belly or face. This helps to make them hard to see when they sit in trees. Sometimes, owls in the same spcies look different from each other. Scops owls are small and move easily. Female scops owls are usually larger than males in the same species.

For a long time, scientists thought screech owls were scops owls too. Now, scientists think that they are two different groups of owls.

The genus "Otus" was first used in 1769. The Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant made it for the Indian scops owl ("O. bakkamoena"). The name comes from the Latin word "" and the Greek word "ōtos" meaning horned or eared owl (cf. οὖς, ὠτός, "ear"). Marie Jules César Savigny made the English name "Scops" in 1809. and it comes from the Greek "skōps" meaning small owl.

Scientists have changed their minds about which owls should be in "Otus" and which owls are only their relatives. For most of the 20th century, scientists said screech owls were also scops owls. But they changed their minds. Now, screech owls are in their own genus, "Megascops". Screech owls live in the Americas, and they act differently, live in different places, have different body shapes, and have different DNA from scops owls.

Scientists have changed their minds about "Otus" many times, especially about whether screech owls should be in it or not. DNA evidence helped them decide.

By the mid-19th century, scientists knew that "Otus" had more than one genus in it. First, in 1848, scientists made a second genus for screech owls, "Megascops". In 1850s, they made other genera for other owls that had been in "Otus". They made "Macabra", "Ptilopsis", "Gymnasio", "Gymnoglaux", and "Pyrroglaux" for different groups of owls.

In the early 20th century, scientists liked the idea of putting species in a few big groups instead of more small groups. The 3rd edition of the AOU checklist in 1910 put the screech owls back in "Otus". Although not all scientists agreed about this, it was the most common way to think about owl groups for most of the 20th century. In 1988, some scientists tried to put back all the genera from 140 years earlier by treating them as subgenuses inside "Otus". But this did not make sense. It did not match the evolutionary and phylogenetic information.

In the late 20th century, scientists started to use DNA to tell how animals were related to each other. This changed things for "Otus". In 1999, the first mtDNA cytochrome "b" study of these owls showed that the separate groups were really different genera and not only subgenera. The scientists said that most of the genera proposed around 1850 were right or close to right. Not all scientists agreed at first, but they did more and more DNA studies. In time, almost all scientists came to trust DNA. In 2003, the AOU formally decided to take screech owls out of "Otus" and put them in the genus "Megascops".

The genus "Otus" has 59 species (including 3 extinct species):

Two extinct species are sometimes placed in the genus:

On May 14, 1994, scientists heard what sounded like an "Otus" owl calling at about 1,000 meters above sea level south of the summit of Camiguin in the Philippines. No scientists had found any scops owls on that island before. Sometimes people discover new species of "Otus". There may be another "Otus" owl living on the island.

The fossil record for scops owls does not tell us everything. Some older writings say many species of "Otus" owls are now extinct, but maybe those owls really belong in different genera:

People found scops owl fossils that look like the Eurasian scops-owl on the Spanish island Majorca. The scops and screech owls probably both evolved during the Miocene (like many owls). They probably became separate groups 5 million years ago. Their common ancestor was probably a small owl with ear tufts and feathers on at least the upper tarsus (leg).

Scops owls voices sound like whistling or a row of high-pitched hoots, fewer than four hoots per second. The owls call like this for social interaction or to scare away other animals. But different species of scops owls sound different from each other. Human beings usually know scops owls are nearby because they hear them calling. Human beings can tell scops owl species apart by their voices. Some, like the Serendib scops owl ("Otus thilohoffmanni"), were discovered because birdcall experts could tell their voices were new to them.

Scops owls hunt from perches in landscapes with only a few trees. They live more in areas with old trees with hollows in them. The animals they like to eat live in hollows. For example, insects, reptiles, and small mammals such as bats and mice and other small birds. The owls will also eat earthworms, amphibians, and aquatic animals without bones. Scops owls can hear very well, which helps them find animals to eat. They also have strong claws and a curved bill, both of which help them tear prey into small pieces that they can eat.

Most scops owls live alone. Most scops owls lay and sit on their eggs in a nest in a hole in a tree. They do not dig the holes themselves. Instead, they go into holes that other animals made. The female sits on the eggs and the male brings her food. These birds are monogamous, and both parents take care of the chicks.

Lake Natron

Lake Natron is a salt or alkaline lake in north Ngorongoro District of Arusha Region in Tanzania. It is in the Gregory Rift, which is the eastern branch of the East African Rift. The lake is inside the Lake Natron Basin, a Ramsar Site wetland of international significance.

The lake is mainly fed by the Southern Ewaso Ng'iro River, which rises in central Kenya, and by mineral-rich hot springs. It is less than deep. Its width depends on its water level. The lake is a maximum of long and wide. 

In the surrounding area rain is infrequent. Most of the rain occurs between December and May. The total rainfall is about per year. Temperatures at the lake are frequently above .

High levels of evaporation have left behind natron (sodium carbonate decahydrate) and trona (sodium sesquicarbonate dihydrate). The alkalinity of the lake can reach a pH of greater than 12. The surrounding bedrock is made of alkaline, sodium-dominated trachyte lavas that were laid down during the Pleistocene period. The lavas have significant amounts of carbonate but very low calcium and magnesium levels. This has allowed the lake to concentrate into a caustic alkaline brine.
The lake is home to a number of wading birds, notably flamingoes. They feed on small crustaceans that live in the lake. In some areas, all three species of Alcolapia can be found. Alcolapia are small fish.

NGC 6357

NGC 6357 is a H II Region diffuse nebula near NGC 6334 in the constellation Scorpius. The nebula contains many proto stars that are protected by dark discs of gas. It also contains young stars wrapped in expanding "cocoons" or expanding gases surrounding these small stars. The nebula is also known as the Lobster Nebula. It was given the name War and Peace Nebula by the Midcourse Space Experiment scientists because of its look. In infrared images the bright, western part looks like a dove and the eastern part looks like a skull. Anime fans tried to get NASA to rename it as the Madokami nebula because it was like a character from the "Madokami" anime, The name was not changed.

The nebula is about 5,500 light years from Earth.

This nebula includes the open cluster Pismis 24. There are many massive stars in this cluster. One of the brightest stars in the cluster i, Pismis 24-1, It was thought to be the most massive star on record. The star measures almost 300 solar masses. It was later learned that it was a multiple system of at least three stars. These three stars are each near 100 solar masses. This makes them among the more massive stars on record.

The young stellar cluster G353.2+0.7 lies at the east of Pismis 24. It was revealed by a Chandra X-ray image showing about 800 stars.

The young stellar cluster G353.1+0.6 lies at the southeast of Pismis 24. It has about 800 stars that were detected by X-ray. The region includes many O-type stars, including [BDSB2003] 10.

Hekla 3 eruption

The Hekla 3 eruption (circa 1000 BCE) is thought to be the most severe eruption of Hekla during the Holocene.

It threw more than 7 km of volcanic rock into the atmosphere. This would have caused a volcanic winter, cooling temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere for many years afterwards.
Some claim that an eighteen-year span of global cooling that is recorded in Irish bog oaks can be blamed on Hekla-3.

Some Egyptologists have blamed Hekla-3 for famines under Ramesses III during the wider Bronze Age collapse.

Greek Heroic Age

The Greek Heroic Age, in mythology, is the period between the coming of the Greeks to Thessaly and the Greek return from Troy. It was identified as one of the five Ages of Man by Hesiod. The heroes mentioned are superhuman, but not god-like, and are celebrated in the literature of Homer.

Muhammad Alauddin Siddiqui

Muhammad Alauddin Siddiqui (; 1 January 1938 – 3 February 2017) was an Islamic scholar.

He appeared in islamic programmes on ARY Q TV and on NOOR TV. He established madrassas for religious education and mosques in Pakistan and England. He was also the founder ofMohiudin Islamic University in Nerian Sharif and Mohiudin Islamic Medical College in Mirpur.

Siddiqui studied his early Islamic education in the presence of his father, Pir Ghulam Mohi-ud-Din. Later, in Jamia Haqqa’iq al Uloom he studied Mishkat Sharif and Jalalayn. His passion for further studies brought him to Jamia Naeemia Lahore where he completed lessons. Then he participated in the Daura e Qur'an with Abdul Ghufar Hazarawi. He next completed the teaching of Hadith Mubarakah from Sardar Ahmad Chishti.

On October 6, 2012 to express his outrage at the recent film "Innocence of Muslims", Siddiqui called for a protest outside Parliament of London. He appealed to the Muslim to unite under the banner of the Prophet of Islam. He spoke on the importance of a united front of the Muslim Ummah against Islamophobia.

Thousands of Muslims gathered outside the Houses of Parliament in London on Saturday, October 2012 to express their feelings about the honoring of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). It was attended by Muslims from all sects of the Islamic community, including speakers from Sunni and Shia Islam.

On 10 June 2012,Siddiqui was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for humanitarian, education and health services by Institute of Peace and Development.

Siddiqui's name was appeared seven times in the list of 500 Most Influential Muslims in the list of "Preachers and Spiritual leaders" from UK.

Alauddin Siddiqui died in London, February 3, 2017 after a short illness.

Two funeral prayers were offered for him. First funeral prayer was held in Birmingham's Austin Park. More than 20,000 people attended. His second funeral prayer was led by his older son Sultan Ul Arfeen Siddiqui held in his home town Nerian Sharif. Was attended by more than 50,000 people .

NEAR Shoemaker

NEAR Shoemaker was a NASA mission. It flew by the Asteroid 253 Mathilde. It orbited and landed on the asteroid 433 Eros. 

This is the first mission by NASA's Discovery program. It is also the first mission to orbit and land on an asteroid. Its first attempt to orbit the asteroid failed. Although they tried again, and they did it. 

After landing on the asteroid, the probe lasted for only around 2 weeks. This was because of the cold temperatures.

Arthur Amos Noyes was an American chemist. He was also the president of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).

Hyloscirtus hillisi

The Hyloscirtus hillisi is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place, between 1991 and 2134 meters above sea level on a limestone mountain.

The adult male frog is 66.7-72.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 65.8 mm long. The skin on the frog's back is dark in color with tiny yellow spots. The skin on the frog's belly is gray in color. The iris of the eye is yellow or bronze in color.

This frog lives in forests with many short woody plants about 1.5 m tall. There are trees there too, about 10-15 m tall. Scientists found tadpoles and young frogs in ponds near the river.

Scientists named this frog after David M. Hillis. Hillis studied amphibians and especially frogs in "Hyloscirtus".

Raider Squadrons

The Raider Command, aka, LOK () or () also known as Rangers, National Guard Special Forces () is a Special Forces and Special Operations Force within the Cypriot National Guard. It is currently based in Larnaca, Cyprus.

The main mission of LOK is Mountain and Guerrilla warfighting. After its creation in the 1960s, it began training in the Troodos Mountains and soon, began operations against Turkish armed people (Mainly TMT) and elements of Turkish special forces which were operating on the island.Until the invasion in 1974, this was LOKs most important mission. Since then, the unit has changed to fit the condition of the geostrategic location of Cyprus, the modern threats facing the country including but not limited to, the war on terror and the threat created by Turkey. Today LOKs missions can be from Mountain/ Border Patrols, to Combat Search and Rescue. It can do Direct Action missions and Paratrooping Operations. LOK also focuses in Hostage Rescue and fighting in close range to the enemy.

All members of this Military unit (or group of people) wear the unit written sign/symbol showing a winged sword, which shows of the "deadly, silent and fast" nature of special forces operations. A scroll runs across the sword and wings with the saying "Who Dares Wins" ( - "O Tolmon Nika"), a message of thanks to the Free Greek Special Forces that served with the 1st Special Air Service (1 SAS) during World War II. The unit flash is marked with Δυνάμεις Καταδρομών (Raider Forces).

All Raiders wear the green beret with the Greek national emblem on the left.

Immediately after its begining in 1964, the Commando Battalions were put into action to fight against both Turkish terrorist organisations (Such as TMT) and the Turkish Armed Forces. LOK played an important role in both, the Battles of Tylliria which happened in August 1964 and in Kofinou in 1967.

In the Battle of Tillyria, LOK was responsible for clearing villages and taking on any Turkish resistance in the area. Although the newly found Cypriot National Guard had just had its first victory, LOK had also lost its first 3 Commandos after being killed in the fighting. 

During Operation Kofinou, LOKs job was to at first clear the hills of any Turkish figthers (From either TMT or the Turkish military) and was later given the job of clearing the village of any resistance left in the area. For this operation, both the 31st and the 32nd Commando Battalions took part whilst also helping the armored division and Cyprus Police. 1 Commando was killed during the successful Operation. 

Throughout the Turkish invasion, LOK played a role in preventing the Turkish Military from moving any further, defending areas such as the Nicosia International Airport taking key points such as areas of the Pentadaktylos mountains and cutting off key routes such as those seen in Operation Lavida. 

In the first phase of the invasion, the Raiders Command put into plan Operation Lavida, which was a plan to cut off/disturb the Kyrenia-Kionelli enclave from getting more support from the invading Army. It was a nighttime operation beginning at about 11PM and was planned into the following:


In the late 1970s, after the murder of a an Egyptian, Yusuf Sibai, the PFLPs hijacked a Cyprus Airways DC-8. The task of the Commandos units was to (if necessary) take out the hijackers, however, due to the turn of events, they ended up having to take on members of Egyptian Special Forces who tried doing a rescue operation, without authorisation from the Cypriot Government. The Commandos of the 32nd Commando Battalion successfully stopped the Egyptian attack. 

In the Cypriot Army Special Forces, they train mostly like their brothers in Greece (As they refer to as their mother unit, LOK). Candidates will do a few weeks of physical trainings and then go on to their further training which includes (But is not limited to), Survival and Evasion, Combat Diving, Paratrooping and climbing.

Scam baiting

Scam baiting is when a person online, called a scambaiter, pretends to be a person who is vulnerable to a specific scam and wastes a scammer's time and resources.

Internet scams come in many forms, and so scam baiting comes in many forms too. For written scams (scam emails), the scambaiter usually answers the scam email using a temporary ("throwaway") email account, pretending to fall for the scam. This makes the scammer vulnerable to be tricked, since the scammer may do lots of things in order to scam the scambaiter. The scammer may be tricked into answering a very long survey, taking a very long trip, or even downloading a computer virus. Such a virus is often used to take control of the scammer's computer and play pranks on them and expose them.

For scams that are performed over a phone call, Scambaiters may pretend to not be able to hear the scammer. This makes the scammer talk slowly and loudly, wasting their time and making the scammer look silly to anyone in the room. The scambaiter may also put the scammer on hold for a long time (possibly for hours) while pretending to take another call.

Solvable group

In mathematics, a solvable group or soluble group is a group which has a subnormal series with abelian factors.

The Feit-Thompson theorem says that every group of odd order is solvable.

Every finite group of order 60 or greater, every abelian group, and every subgroup of a solvable group is solvable.

The definition of solvable groups show why the polynomial equations of degree greater than 5 are (in general) not solvable using finite arithmetic operations (Galois theory).

Order (group theory)

The order of a group is the number of times an element of the group has to be operated to arrive to the identity element.

Some people also define the order as the cardinality of the group set.

Kernel (algebra)

The kernel of a group homomorphism from "G" to "H" is the subset of the elements from "G" that arrive to the Identity element of "H". 

Mathematically: formula_1. Since a group homomorphism preserves identity elements, the identity element of "G" must belong to the kernel subset.

The homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel is only the identity elements of "G".

Proof: If "f" were not injective, then the non-injective elements can form a distinct element of its kernel: there would exist formula_2 such that formula_3 and formula_4. Thus formula_5. "f" is a group homomorphism, so inverses and group operations are preserved, giving formula_6; in other words, formula_7, and ker "f" would not be the singleton. Conversely, distinct elements of the kernel violate injectivity directly: if there would exist an element formula_8, then formula_9, thus "f" would not be injective.

Group homomorphism

A group homomorphism is a transformation made from one group to another. This change preserves all group axioms and operations.

Thales's theorem

Thales's theorem is a theorem (rule) in geometry. It says that if three points, formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 are on a circle where formula_4 is a diameter (a straight line from one end of the circle to another, through the middle), the angle formula_5 is a right angle of 90 degrees. This is a special case of the inscribed angle theorem.

Anthem of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic

The "State Anthem of the Byelorussian SSR" (, ) was the anthem of Belarus from 1955 to 1991.

Judah (son of Jacob)

Judah is a person from the Book of Genesis. He was the ancestor of the tribe that became the Kingdom of Judah.

It is written in the Torah, in the Book of Genesis that Jacob married both Leah and her sister Rachel and loved Rachel but not Leah. So Leah prayed to the Lord for a son so that she wouldn’t be hated. Then Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son and she said “now my husband shall love me” and named him Reuben. Then Leah gave birth to a second son and said that the Lord had heard her voice so she named him Simeon. Then Leah gave birth to a third son and said “I have poured my heart unto the Lord” and named him Levi. Then Leah gave birth to a fourth son and said “this time I will thank the Lord” and she named him Judah.

After Judah was born, Rachel came to Jacob and said “give me children otherwise I am dead” and Jacob told her that he couldn’t give her a miracle like that since he was only human. So Rachel told Jacob to marry her servant Bilhah and Bilhah gave birth to two sons named Dan and Naphtali. Leah then told Jacob to marry her servant Zilpah and Zilpah gave birth to two sons named Gad and Asher. Then Leah gave birth to Zebulun and Issachar. Then Leah gave birth to a daughter Dinah and Rachel gave birth to a son Joseph. Later, Rachel died in childbirth and her son was named Benjamin. 

Jacob loved Joseph more than all of his other children because Joseph was born when he was an old man and because it took many years for Rachel to be able to give birth. So Jacob gave Joseph a coat with many colours. And Joseph had dreams about his brothers all bowing to him so they became jealous and they took Joseph and threw him in a big hole in the ground and left him to die. But then Judah felt guilty about that so he told his brothers that instead of letting Joseph die, they should take him and sell him as a slave to the Ishmaelites and they did. And when Reuben found out, he was angry with Judah because Reuben was planning to rescue Joseph. 

Judah married a woman and had three sons named Er, Onan and Shelah. Er married a woman named Tamar but Er died childless so Judah told Onan to marry Tamar and raise their children to think of themselves as the children of Er to honour his memory. But instead of having children with her, Onan threw his semen on the ground. The Lord killed Onan for this. After Onan died, Judah’s son Shelah was supposed to marry Tamar but Judah didn’t let him do that because he was scared Shelah would also die. So Tamar dressed up as a prostitute and had sex with Judah but asked for his staff and seal to let her know that he would pay. When Judah came back to pay her, not having recognized her as Tamar, she was gone. When the people told Judah that Tamar was pregnant Judah said to burn her for prostitution but Tamar said that the father was the person who owned the staff, seal and cord. Then Judah said “she is indeed more righteous than I am” and said he was the father. So Judah married Tamar and she gave birth to twins named Peretz and Zerach. 

When there was a famine in Canaan, Judah and his brothers except for Joseph and Benjamin came to Egypt to ask for grain. Joseph was the viceroy but Judah and the others didn’t recognize him. Joseph asked them if they had any other brothers and they told him about Benjamin. Joseph then said they were spies and jailed Simeon and said that he would only free him if they brought Benjamin to Egypt to prove they were telling the truth. When they told Jacob this, he said “first, I lost Joseph, then I lost Simeon, and now you would have me lose Benjamin!” but Judah still convinced Jacob to let him bring Benjamin to Egypt by making a promise to protect him. And when they made it to Egypt, Joseph freed Simeon and gave the brothers everything they wanted but also framed Benjamin for stealing from him and said he would enslave Benjamin as punishment. So Judah begged Joseph to have mercy on Benjamin and enslave Judah instead. Then all of Judah’s brothers joined in saying the exact same thing so Joseph told them “I am Joseph, your brother”. Judah and his brothers thought that Joseph would want revenge but instead Joseph gave them his forgiveness saying that the Lord had brought him to Egypt to save lives.

In the Tanakh, Judah’s descendants are a tribe called the Tribe of Judah. In the Book of Exodus, Nacshon is the first person to jump before the splitting of the sea and is from the Tribe of Judah. And when Moses sends twelve spies to Canaan in the Book of Numbers, one for each tribe, Caleb is the spy for Judah and aside from Joshua is the only one of them to say nice things about the Promised Land. In the Book of Judges the first Judge Othniel is from the Tribe of Judah and Judah is normally the tribe that leads the Israelites in battle. 

In the Book of Ruth, Judah’s son Peretz became the ancestor of Boaz. Boaz married Ruth and had a son Jesse and Jesse became the father of David. In the Books of Samuel, David became King of the tribe of Judah after Saul died and only became King of Israel after the death of Saul’s son Ishbosheth. 

After David’s son King Solomon died, his son Rehoboam couldn’t keep the kingdom together so it split into two kingdoms. The one in the north was called the Kingdom of Israel and the one in the south was called Judah. The kingdom of Judah was eventually destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II who exiled its people. 

After the Kingdom of Israel was conquered and destroyed by Assyria, the kingdom of Judah survived under the leadership of Hezekiah and its people came to be known as the Judahites or the Jews, meaning the people of Judah. And even after the exile to Mesopotamia started, they still called themselves the Jews.

In the later books of the Tanakh, a man named Zerubabel, who is a descendant of Judah is important in rebuilding the Temple of Jerusalem.
Prophecies in the Tanakh and Old Testament say that the Messiah would be a descendant of David, who was descended from Judah, and that he would bring Judah and Israel back from exile.

The New Testament begins the Gospel of Matthew with a family tree which has Judah become the father of Peretz and Zerach, with Peretz becoming the ancestor of Jesus’s stepfather Joseph and the Gospel of Luke says that the Virgin Mary is also a descendant of David making Judah an ancestor of Jesus.

Spacecraft propulsion

Spacecraft propulsion is the method that a spacecraft uses to control its movement through outer space. A spacecraft with no means of propelling itself is typically considered derelict. 

The problem of propelling a spacecraft has, predictably, existed since spacecraft themselves. Most spacecraft are propelled by rocket engines, which combust an explosive liquid fuel with liquid oxidizer (oxygen in a liquid state) to generate hot gas which expands and propels the spacecraft forward.

Many methods of spacecraft propulsion have been developed and practiced. Most work by accelerating a propellant to a very high speed and ejecting it from the spacecraft through a nozzle.

A chemical rocket works by mixing an explosive propellant with liquid oxygen and burning it under pressure. This releases a great amount of heat. It results in a rapidly expanding gas. This gas is then funneled out of the rocket's nozzle (usually a bell shape) and off into space.

An ion thruster works by using static electricity or magnetism to accelerate ions (atoms with an electric charge) to very high speeds, and out of the thruster's nozzle. Ion thrusters make very little thrust but are very efficient.

A nuclear thermal rocket heats a propellant with heat from a nuclear reactor before expelling it through a nozzle. Nuclear thermal rockets are currently experimental, but will have decent thrust and high efficiency once put into practice.

Simeon

Simeon is a person in the Torah and Old Testament. Simeon was the second son of Jacob and Leah and the ancestor of one of the Twelve Tribes of the Israelites.

After Leah gave birth to her second son she said that the Lord had heard her voice so she named her son Simeon. She then gave birth to another son and said “I have poured out my heart to the Lord” and named him Levi.

When a prince named Shechem raped Dinah after having kidnapped her, he and his father Hamor wanted Shechem to marry her. So Jacob’s sons told him to tell Hamor to tell the men of Shechem to circumcise themselves. And then they did, so Shechem could marry Dinah. Then Simeon and his brother Levi killed every adult male in Shechem and rescued Dinah. But Jacob was angry with Simeon and Levi since he thought that the Canaanites would kill them all for it. So they asked him “should our sister be treated as a whore”. 

Simeon was the one of Joseph’s brothers that he jailed to get the others to bring Benjamin to Egypt. 

When Jacob died, he told Simeon and Levi that because of the massacre of Shechem they wouldn’t have land of their own as part of their inheritance but would instead be contained by the lands of the other tribes. So the tribe of Simeon had its lands surrounded on all sides by land belonging to the tribe of Judah. 

Nigerian Civil War

The Nigerian Civil War was a civil war fought between the government of Nigeria and the Republic of Biafra.

"Food was cut off from the 13 million inhabitants of Biafra"; Furthermore, "At the height of the war, an estimated 10,000 people (including 6,000 children) died from starvation every day".

Levi

Levi was a person in the Book of Genesis who was a son of Jacob and Leah. Along with his brother Simeon he killed the men of Shechem for the rape of Dinah. Because of that, his father Jacob told him that his tribe would not have his land as part of their inheritance but would live on the land of other tribes.

Levi had three sons and they were named Gershon, Kehath and Merari.

Kehath had a son named Amaram. Amaram married a woman named Yocheved and became the father of Miriam, Aaron and Moses. Moses became the prophet to the Israelites and Aaron became the High Priest. 

While the sons of Aaron and their male descendants became the priests, the rest of Levi’s descendant known as the Levites helped the priests in the sanctuary. Their tribe didn’t get any land of their own because they instead had to be the religious ministers to everyone in the other tribes who had to let the Levites live on their land.

Dinah

Dinah was a person from the Book of Genesis who was the daughter of Jacob and Leah. After Shechem kidnapped her, brought her to his hometown and raped her, he wanted to marry her. So Shechem’s father, a king named Hamor asked Jacob what it would take for Shechem to marry Dinah. Jacob asked his sons what to do about what had happened and they told him to tell Hamor that the daughters of Israel would never marry the men of Shechem unless they agreed to circumcision. Then the men of Shechem actually circumcised themselves. Then Shechem married Dinah. Then three days later, Simeon and Levi, killed all adult males in Shechem as revenge for the rape of Dinah. When Jacob was worried that the Canaanites would kill them for that and was angry with Simeon and Levi because of it, they asked him “shall our sister be treated as a whore.”

Benjamin

Benjamin was the youngest son of Jacob and the second son of Rachel. When Rachel gave birth to Joseph she prayed that the Lord would one day give her another child. And when Jacob and his family left Aramea, Rachel stole the idols of her father Laban without telling Jacob so when Laban came to Jacob and asked him “why did you steal my gods” Jacob said that he didn’t do it and curses the person who did it to die. Later, Rachel became pregnant and gave birth to a son and since she was dying in childbirth she named him Ben-Oni, son of my suffering, and after Rachel died, Jacob named the boy Benjamin, the son of the right.

After the sale of Joseph, Jacob thought Joseph was dead so he decided always to keep Benjamin by his side to protect him so that nothing could happen to him. But Judah (Biblical personage) still convinced him to let him bring Benjamin to Egypt with a promise to keep him safe. Then Benjamin was framed for stealing a cup from Joseph and Joseph said that he would enslave Benjamin as punishment but Judah and his brothers asked Joseph to have mercy on Benjamin and take them instead. Then Joseph told them he was their long lost brother and forgave them.

Benjamin became the ancestor of an Israelite tribe called the Benjaminites.

According to a Midrash in the Talmud, Benjamin was one of only four people who never sinned in their entire life.

National anthem of Mongolia

The National Anthem of Mongolia was created in 1950. This was known before 1991 as the State Anthem of the Mongolian People's Republic. The words of the song were written by a Mongolian author named Tsendiin Damdinsüren, and the melody to his words were made by two composers by the names of Bilegiin Damdinsüren and Luvsanjambyn Mördorj.

The lyrics (words) of this song has been changed three times. First the lyrics were changed in 1961 to remove mentions of specific leaders; then in 1991, when communism came to an end, the lyrics no longer mentioned communism nor the Soviet Union; and finally in 2006, the lyrics were changed slightly, and this is the current version used till this day.

"Dirty Laundry" is a 1982 song by Don Henley and was taken from his debut studio album "I Can't Stand Still". It went to number 1 in Canada, number 2 in South Africa, number 3 in the United States, number 7 in New Zealand and number 8 in Austria.

Nuclear thermal rocket

A nuclear thermal rocket (abbreviated to NTR) is a type of rocket engine which heats a propellant (usually liquid hydrogen) using a nuclear reactor. This is different from chemical rockets, which burn their propellant to heat it. NTRs have higher exhaust velocities than chemical rockets, high enough to triple a spacecraft's payload capacity (the amount of cargo or astronauts they can carry to their destination).

NTRs have the potential to be very fuel efficient while still providing good thrust, but their thrust-to-weight ratio is very small. A rocket's thrust-to-weight ratio (TWR) is the proportion between the amount of thrust the spacecraft can make and how much the spacecraft weighs. For example, a spacecraft that weighs 100 pounds and can produce 10 pounds of thrust would have a TWR of 1:10. An average chemical rocket has a TWR of about 70:1, but an average NTR has a TWR of 7:1. This means that NTRs have to burn for a long time to get the same acceleration as a chemical rocket. This is balanced by their high fuel efficiency.

NTRs have not been tested in space yet, but a special program named DRACO is going to attempt to do so.

Costa Rica brook frog

The Costa Rica brook frog or red-eyed stream frog ("Duellmanohyla uranochroa") is a frog. It lives in Costa Rica and Panama. Scientists have seen it between 70 and 1740 meters above sea level.

The skin of the frog's back is green in color. The belly and neck are bright yellow. The parts of the legs that face the ground are yellow but less bright. There is a yellow-white stripe from the mouth to the place where the legs meet the body, one on each side. The iris of the eye is bright red. The female frog is bigger than the male frog, and she has bigger eardrums.

This frog moves at night. They go to mountain streams to look for food. During the day, they sit in bromeliad plants. The frogs lay eggs in May and June. The frog's voice sounds like "boop boop boop boop," but different frogs and frogs in different places can sound different. The female frog lays eggs in pools of water with silt on the bottom instead of sand or mud.

This frog is in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives. Sometimes even small changes can hurt this frog. Climate change and ultraviolet light can also kill this frog.

So Rehoboam told Jeroboam and his followers “I have more strength in my little finger than my father had in his entire body, if my father whipped you with lashes then I shall whip you with scorpions”. After that most of the tribes of Israel left Rehoboam to make their own kingdom. Then Rehoboam felt remorse and sent his tax collector Adoniram to make peace with Jereoboam’s followers but then they threw stones at him until he died so Rehoboam ran away. Then Jeroboam called his kingdom, the kingdom of Israel, while Rehoboam called his own kingdom Judah. Rehoboam planned to invade and conquer Jeroboam’s kingdom in the North but the prophet Shemaya told him not to do that so he didn’t.

Rotting Christ has had many problems because of the name of their band. In 1999, Gary Bauer (a candidate to run for president in the United States) said the band was "anti-Catholic" because of their name. Sakis Tolis, the singer for the band, said that "everyone should have the right to call religions as he/she wants", and Rotting Christ is just "one of the many bands that represent the dark side in metal music".

The name has also made the band cancel concerts. In 2005, the singer and guitarist for Megadeth, Dave Mustaine, said he would not play at a Greek concert if Rotting Christ was also playing.

In April 2018, Rotting Christ was arrested in Georgia. This was because the government thought they were terrorists because of the band's name. They were let go later, and were able to play at the concert they had in Georgia.

Well-posed problem

In mathematics, a problem is called well-posed, if all of the following conditions are met:


If at least one of the conditions is not met, the problem is called ill-posed. Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963), a French mathematician, first studied these problems. He believed that mathematical models of physical phenomena should have the properties listed above.
Examples of well-posed problems include the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation, and the heat equation with specified initial conditions. These might be regarded as 'natural' problems, because they model there are physical processes.

Problems that are not well-posed in the sense of Hadamard are termed ill-posed. Inverse problems are often ill-posed. For example, the inverse heat equation, deducing a previous distribution of temperature from final data, is not well-posed in that the solution is highly sensitive to changes in the final data.

Continuum models must often be discretized in order to obtain a numerical solution. While solutions may be continuous with respect to the initial conditions, they may suffer from numerical instability when solved with finite precision, or with errors in the data. Even if a problem is well-posed, it may still be ill-conditioned, meaning that a small error in the initial data can result in much larger errors in the answers. Problems in nonlinear complex systems (so-called chaotic systems) provide well-known examples of instability. An ill-conditioned problem is indicated by a large condition number.

If the problem is well-posed, then it stands a good chance of solution on a computer using a stable algorithm. If it is not well-posed, it needs to be re-formulated for numerical treatment. Typically this involves including additional assumptions, such as smoothness of solution. This process is known as "regularization". Tikhonov regularization is one of the most commonly used for regularization of linear ill-posed problems.

Simeon bar Yochai

Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai was a Rabbi from the Talmud. 

It’s said that when Rabbi Yehudah praised the Roman Empire for building good things, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai criticized the Romans saying that everything they did they only did to help themselves instead of the Jews while Rabbi Yossi said nothing. So the Romans exiled Rabbi Yossi, rewarded Rabbi Yehuda and sentenced Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai to death. 

To escape, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son went into exile and spent years in a cave learning Torah from Elijah. When it was safe for them to leave they left and when Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai saw Jewish farmers farming instead of studying Torah, he criticized them so the field caught on fire and a voice from heaven asked “Have you come out to destroy my world” and told Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son to go back to the cave. They did. 

One year later, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son left the cave and after speaking to the other Jews, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai praised them for how much they honoured the Sabbath. According to tradition, what Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai learned from Elijah eventually became the Zohar.

1796 United States presidential election

The 1796 presidential election was between Federalist John Adams and Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson. It was the first election where there was competition for the presidency. Adams and Jefferson became political enemies. However, because it used to be that the second place person would be vice president, it caused Jefferson to awkwardly be Adams' vice president for four years. It would be the reason why the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed later.

George Washington was president during this election, and everyone liked him. However, he said no to running for a third term. This would become a tradition where every president would only serve two terms, known as the "two-term tradition". After it was broken by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, it became a Constitutional amendment. The two political parties, the Democratic-Republican Party and the Federalist Party, all had people who wanted to be president. However, the two most popular people were John Adams, a Federalist who was the vice president, and Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican, who was the Secretary of State.

John Adams ended up winning, getting 71 electoral votes. This made him the new president. Thomas Jefferson became vice president, getting 68 electoral votes. For the next four years, the bitter enemies had to work side-by-side. In a speech by George Washington, he urged people to not resort to political parties as they would just divide people. This election would lead to the election of 1800 that was also called the "Revolution of 1800".

Tiger parenting

Tiger parenting is a form of strict authoritarian parenting, whereby parents are highly invested in ensuring their children's success. Specifically, tiger parents push their children to attain high levels of academic achievement or success in high-status extracurricular activities such as music or sports.

The term "tiger mother" ("tiger mom") was coined by Yale Law School professor Amy Chua in her 2011 memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.

Tiger parenting is common in many Asian countries, such as Malaysia. It can be refered to as violent parenting, where a child is being subject to harsh physical punishment, which is considered to be called child abuse outside Asia.

In extreme cases, harming of parents may occur like Sef Gonzales and Jennifer Pan, but in some cases, when dealing with autistic children, tiger parenting may be bolstered by the likes of Kiwi Farms and Something Awful.

Woody plant encroachment

Woody plant encroachment is when bushes, shrubs and woody plants grow more and take over an area where there used to be grass and other plants. It happens mostly in grasslands, savannas and woodlands and can change the area from being open to being closed. The causes of this include things like people using the land too much, not having fires, and climate change. It can be bad for nature and for people who use the land. Some countries try to stop this by doing things like cutting down some of the bushes, using fire and managing the land. Sometimes, this type of land is good for the climate because it can take in carbon. But, it is not always good and more research is needed to understand the effects on the climate.

It is different from invasive species which are plants that are brought from other places.

Woody encroachment probably started thousands of years ago, when Earth started warming, but it has happened much faster during the last 50 years. There are different possible reasons for woody encroachment, some directly linked to the action of people, others linked to climate change. The reasons for woody encroachment are very different between dry grasslands and wet grasslands. Once the bushes and shrubs have grown and taken over an area, they make it harder for grass to grow. This makes the problem of woody encroachment continue.

When people abandon land, that means when they stop using the land for agriculture, bushes often start growing. This happens for example in the Alps in Southern Europe, because more and more people leave their farms and move to cities.

Also when people use land very intensively, bush encroachment can happen. For example when farmers bring many cows to areas where wild animals lived before, these cows eat up most of the grass quickly, but do not touch the bushes. The result is that bushes occupy more and more of the land, while grasses start to disappear. Once woody encroachment has started, it is hard to stop it, even when the number of cows is made less.

While changes in how people use the land is often seen as the main reason for woody encroachment, some studies suggest that global factors like climate change and rainfall patterns also play a role. Climate change can make it easier for bushes and shrubs to grow because of things like more CO in the air and changes in temperature and rainfall. Once the bushes and shrubs are established, they can make it harder for grass to grow and the problem of woody encroachment can continue. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, high latitude tundra and boreal forests are particularly at risk of woody encroachment due to climate change.

Woody encroachment is a big change for nature in areas where it happens. Often, the encroachment is seen as harmful to nature. It can make the number of different plant species less, it allows less water to go into the ground and animals have less to eat. For that reason woody encroachment is often called a form or land degradation. But this is not always the case, encroachment can also lead to good changes in nature. That is why one must study woody encroachment in each area where it happens, before making conclusions.

How woody encroachment changes nature depends on different things:


Many scientists see woody encroachment as a form of land degradation and think it can even lead to the creation of new deserts. Because bushes make nature look more green, the encroachment is sometimes called "green desertification".

Woody encroachment can have negative effects on the variety of plants and animals in that area (biodiversity). In Africa, the number of different plants and animals usually decreases when woody encroachment happens. In North America, the number of different plants and animals may increase or decrease depending on the area. In Brazil, one third of the different plant species are lost because of woody encroachment.
The following list shows what species are affected by woody encroachment:

Juice builds on the previously proposed Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM-Laplace), a planned collaborative mission between ESA and NASA that would have carried out an in-depth study of the Jovian system and its icy moons. It is now foreseen that the Juice and NASA Europa Clipper spacecraft will be exploring the Jovian system simultaneously.


Three-axis stabilized with 10 solar panels and a 2.5-metre-long High Gain Antenna, with a dry mass of approximately 2400 kg and a wet mass (including fuel) of approximately 6000 kg. Each solar panel measures about 2.5 m x 3.5 m; with five on each side of the spacecraft deployed as two distinctive cross-shaped arrays, these total an area of about 85 square meters.

Juice will spend approximately eight years cruising to Jupiter, during which it will complete fly-bys of Venus, Earth and the Earth-Moon system. It will reach Jupiter in July 2031; six months before entering orbit around Jupiter, Juice will begin its nominal science phase. The spacecraft will go on to spend many months orbiting Jupiter, completing fly-bys of Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, and finally conducting an orbital tour of Ganymede.

Rare Earth hypothesis

The Rare Earth hypothesis suggests that life on Earth needed an improbable combination of astrophysical and geological circumstances. It is proposed by Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee. If it is true, then the chances of extraterrestrial life elsewhere is close to none.

The idea has nothing to do with the chemicals known as rare earths. The proposed idea suggests that the Earth itself is rare. Certainly, we do not know how rare it is or is not. At present we cannot see planets as small as Earth orbiting their stars. Presumably that could be decided if our powers of magnification were great enough.

Pyrrhic War

The Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC) was mostly fought between the Roman Republic and Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus. he was a distant relative of Alexander the Great. The people of the Greek city of Tarentum in southern Italy asked him to help them in their war against the Romans.

He was a skilled commander, with a strong army supported by war elephants. The Romans were not used to them. Pyrrhus beat the Roman legions, but suffered heavy losses even when he won. Plutarch wrote that Pyrrhus said after the second battle of the war, "If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined." The Romans had plenty of military manpower and could replace their losses. This is the source of the expression "Pyrrhic victory", a victory that inflicts losses the winner cannot afford in the long term.

Worn down by the battles against Rome, Pyrrhus moved his army to Sicily to fight the Carthaginians instead. After several years of campaigning there (278–275 BC), he returned to Italy in 275 BC, where the last battle of the war was fought. The Roman victory. Following this, Pyrrhus returned to Epirus, ending the war. Three years later, in 272 BC, the Romans captured Tarentum.

On March 17, 2017, the newspaper Clarín published an article by Bonelli in which he stated that, during an interview between the former president of the Spanish government Felipe González and President Mauricio Macri, the former had told him that "no one is going to invest seriously in Argentina until Cristina's acts of corruption are judged and sentenced", after asking "When is Cristina going to go to jail?".

The former president responded by sending González and Macri two notes. He urged them to confirm what was stated in Bonelli's article, and considering that the Argentine president had the duty to reject demonstrations that "import unprecedented extortion and undue interference in internal affairs, in addition to the exclusive recourse of justice."

That day, González denied through his spokesman that the former President had maintained that position before the Argentine President, news that was published by the newspaper in a note by Bonelli himself, in which he insisted that what he had published was true. In the same sense, Felipe González spoke and asked the newspaper to clarify the situation, which the newspaper did not.

It became a 100% owned subsidiary of Austrian Airlines in December 2000. They had 35 employees (as of March 2007). In 2005 the flight operations were taken over by Austrian Airlines. Lauda Air is used currently as the brand that operates the charter flights of the Austrian Airlines Group.

Niki Lauda has started a new airline named Niki. For its part, the Austrian Airlines Group will make a decision whether to integrate the entire Lauda Air Charter Flight fleet into the common Austrian Airlines design or not, at the beginning of 2007. The goals would be to identify itself as a single airline (simplicity) and to avoid advertising of Niki Lauda's new airline. This would mean the total disappearance of Lauda Air.

HD 1

HD 1 (also named HIP 422), is the first star catalogued in the "Henry Draper Catalogue" and the 422nd star catalogued in the Hipparcos Catalogue. The star is located in the northern circumpolar constellation Cepheus and has an apparent magnitude of 7.42, making it readily visible in binoculars, but not to the naked eye. The star is located relatively far away at a distance of 1,220 light years but is approaching the Solar System with a spectroscopic radial velocity of −27.3 km/s.

NGC 3109

NGC 3109 is a small barred Magellanic type spiral galaxy or irregular galaxy around 4.34 million ly away in the direction of the constellation of Hydra. NGC 3109 is believed to be tidally interacting with the dwarf elliptical galaxy Antlia Dwarf. It was discovered by John Herschel on March 24, 1835 while he was in what is now South Africa.

NGC 3109 is classified as a Magellanic type irregular galaxy, but it may in fact be a small spiral galaxy. If it is a spiral galaxy, it would be the smallest in the Local Group. NGC 3109 has a mass of about 2.3×109 times the mass of the Sun, of which 20% of the mass is in the form of neutral hydrogen. It is oriented edge-on from our point of view, and may contain a disk and a halo. The disk appears to be composed of stars of all ages, whereas the halo contains only very old and metal-poor stars. NGC 3109 does not appear to possess a galactic nucleus.

From measurements of the neutral atomic hydrogen in the galaxy, it has been found that the disk of NGC 3109 is twisted. The distortion has the same radial velocity as gas in the Antlia Dwarf galaxy, showing that the two galaxies had a close meeting about 1 billion years ago.

Nueva Ecija

 

Nueva Ecija ( Filipino : "Bagong Esiha/Nuweba Esija" ) is one of the provinces not next to water in the Philippines, located in the Central Luzon region . The City of Rice Fields is its capital. Nueva Ecija is near Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Pangasinan, Nueva Vizcaya, Zambales, Bataan and Aurora.

Nueva Ecija is considered the main growing rice in the province of Philippines. It also the leading generate of theonions (in the municipality of Bongabon) in Southeast Asia. Buffalo Milk,vegetables and fruits gathered in the crops in Nueva Ecija are also famous here.

Nueva Ecija is a beautiful place to visit. You can see a mountain range and calmness view and there is lot of delicious food everywhere in Nueva Ecija. Nueva Ecija also known as "Rice bowl of the Philippines". Every corner in Nueva Ecija has rice stores because rice is very famous in Nueva Ecija. 

The Nueva Ecija is divided into 27 municipalities and 5 cities .


Nueva Ecija was formed as a military of comandancia in 1777 by Governor General Clavería, with the capital at Baler (now part of Aurora). Formerly belonging to the province of Pampanga . From its initial establishment, the area of the land grow to cover the entire island of Luzon . There are Spanish records that recognize 2 Spanish provinces ( "counties" ) in the Pacific —Las Islas Filipinas and Nueva Ecija. Poverty was the only reason why the King of Spain did not noticed that Nueva Ecija will separated country in the Philippines in the 1840s. From 1777 to 1917, the territory of Nueva Ecija was split to give way to the creation of another province. The province of Tayabas (now Aurora and Quezon ) including the islands of Polilio, the province of Palanan (now Isabela ), Cagayan, the province of Nueva Vizcaya, the territory that became part of the Province of Quirino, and the province of Manila north of the province of Tondo in 1867, and the District of Morong (now Rizal ) that was created from Nueva Ecija.

The province was named after the old city of the Nueva Écija in Sevilla, Spain .

In 1896, Nueva Ecija was one of the first province to rebilion against Spain, and one of the provinces to declare the independence in 1898.

The "First Scream of Nueva Ecija" was a strike in 1896 led by General Mariano Llanera, who was accompanied by General Manuel Tinio and Pantaleon Valmonte of the Town of Gapan, Nueva Ecija and colonel Alipio Tecson of Cabiao, Nueva Ecija who later became Brigadier General. The strike was held in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija. Alipio Tecson became "Governadorcillo" of Cabiao, Nueva Ecija. 

General Emilio Aguinaldo inaugurated San Isidro, Nueva Ecija as the capitol of the First Republic of the Philippines on March 29, 1899. General Aguinaldo lived in this house owned by Crispulo "Kapitan Pulong" Sideco which then became the de facto Philippine capitol. When the Americans arrived in the town of San Isidro, the Sideco House became the home of Col. Frederick Funston who also captured General Aguinaldo in Palanan, Isabela . It was also in this house that the arrest of General Aguinaldo was discussed.

NGC 300

NGC 300 (also known as Caldwell 70) is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Sculptor. It is one of the nearest galaxies to the Local Group. It probably lies between that and the Sculptor Group. 

The galaxy is the brightest of the five main spirals in the direction of the Sculptor Group. It is at an angle of 42° when viewed from Earth, and looks rather like the Triangulum Galaxy. It is 94,000 light years in diameter, somewhat smaller than the Milky Way, and has an estimated mass of (2.9 ± 0.2) × 10 "M".

The distance of NGC 300 from us is about six million light years.

NGC 300 and the irregular galaxy NGC 55 are members of the Sculptor Group. This is a nearby group of galaxies in the constellation of the Sculptor. Recent measurements of their distance suggest these two galaxies are in the foreground. NGC 300 and NGC 55 probably form a gravitationally bound pair.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a 2022 American superhero movie. 

This is based on the Marvel Comics character Black Panther. It is produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The movie is the sequel to "Black Panther" (2018). It is the 30th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). 

It is directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole. The movie stars Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Dominique Thorne, Florence Kasumba, Michaela Coel, Tenoch Huerta, Martin Freeman, and Angela Bassett. In the movie, the leaders of Wakanda fight to protect their nation after King T'Challa's death.

Ideas for a sequel began after the release of Black Panther in February 2018. Coogler negotiated to return as director in the following months. Then Marvel Studios officially confirmed the sequel's development in mid-2019. Plans for the movie changed in August 2020 when "Black Panther" star Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer. Marvel chose not to recast his role of T'Challa. Other main cast members from the first movie were confirmed to return by that November. 

The title was announced in May 2021. Production initially took place from late June to early November 2021, in Atlanta and Brunswick, Georgia, as well as around Massachusetts. This was before a break was made to allow Wright to recover from an injury sustained during filming. Production resumed by mid-January 2022 and ended in late March in Puerto Rico.

"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" premiered at the El Capitan Theatre and the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on October 26, 2022. It was released in the United States on November 11. It is the last movie in Phase Four of the MCU.

T'Challa, king of Wakanda, is suffering from an illness which his sister, Shuri, believes can be cured by the "heart-shaped herb". Shuri attempts to synthetically recreate the herb after it was destroyed by Killmonger but fails to do so before he succumbs.

One year later, Wakanda is under pressure from other nations to share their vibranium, with some parties attempting to steal it by force. Queen Ramonda implores Shuri to continue her research on the heart-shaped herb, hoping to create a new Black Panther that will defend Wakanda, but she refuses due to her belief that the Black Panther is a figure of the past. In the Atlantic Ocean, the CIA and U.S. Navy SEALs utilize a vibranium-detecting machine to locate a potential vibranium deposit underwater. The expedition is attacked and killed by a group of blue-skinned water-breathing superhumans led by Namor, with the CIA believing Wakanda to be responsible. Namor confronts Ramonda and Shuri, easily bypassing Wakanda's advanced security. Blaming Wakanda for the vibranium race, he gives them an ultimatum: deliver him the scientist responsible for the vibranium-detecting machine, or he will attack Wakanda.

Shuri and Okoye learn from CIA agent Everett K. Ross that the scientist in question is MIT student Riri Williams and arrive at the university to confront her. The group is pursued by the FBI and then by Namor's warriors, who defeat Okoye before taking Shuri and Williams underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye's failure to protect Shuri, Ramonda strips her of her title as general of the Dora Milaje and seeks out Nakia, who has been living in Haiti since the Blip. Namor shows Shuri his vibranium-rich underwater kingdom of Talokan, which he has protected for centuries from discovery by the world. Bitter at the surface world for enslaving the Maya, Namor proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world but threatens to destroy Wakanda first if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Williams escape, and Namor retaliates with an attack against Wakanda, during which Ramonda drowns saving Williams. Namor vows to return in a week with his full army, and the citizens of Wakanda relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety. Meanwhile, Ross is arrested by his ex-wife and CIA director, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with the Wakandans.

Using a remnant of the herb that gave Namor's people their superhuman abilities, Shuri reconstructs the heart-shaped herb and ingests it, gaining superhuman abilities and meeting Killmonger in the Ancestral Plane, who urges her to seek revenge. Shuri dons a new Black Panther suit and is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. Despite M'Baku's urges for peace, Shuri is determined to exact vengeance on Namor for Ramonda's death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle, with Ayo assuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje, Shuri bestows the Midnight Angel armor upon Okoye, who in turn recruits Dora member Aneka to join her. Williams creates an Iron Man-esque powered exoskeleton to aid the Wakandans.

The Wakandans lure Namor and his warriors to the surface as a battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft, intending to dry him out and weaken him. The pair crashes on a desert beach and fight. Shuri gains the upper hand, but realizes the similarities between their paths and implores Namor to yield, offering him a peaceful alliance. Namor accepts, and the battle ends. Namor's cousin, Namora, is upset at Namor's surrender. Namor reassures her that their new alliance will allow them to conquer the surface world one day. Williams returns to MIT, leaving her suit behind, while Okoye rescues Ross from captivity. In Shuri's absence, M'Baku steps forward to challenge for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti where she burns her funeral ceremonial robe in accordance with Ramonda's wishes, allowing herself to finally grieve T'Challa.

In a mid-credits scene, Shuri learns that Nakia and T'Challa had a son named Toussaint, who Nakia has been raising in secret far from the pressure of the throne. Toussaint reveals his Wakandan name is T'Challa.

Kamyshin school massacre

On March 9, 1997, an incident occurred at the Kamyshin High Military Construction Command and Engineering School. In the incident, six students died and two students were injured. 

At around 4 a.m. on 9 March 1997, 18-year-old cadet Sergei Lepnev, who surrendered his gun during the change of guard, opened fire on other cadets after he shot the guard Gennady Ivanov in the head. When Lepnev went to finish Pavel Grigoryev's work, the bullet in his gun ran out and they fled the scene with Arefyov.

The court sentenced Arefyev to 3.5 years in prison and Lepnev to death. These sentences were commuted to a 25-year strict regime due to the moratorium. Lepnev is currently serving his sentence in the "White Swan" penitentiary. He was tried to be released on parole in March 2021. 

Described as a "good boy" by his acquaintances, Sergei Lepnev studied well and had no problems at school. 

Spania

Spania () was a province of the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire) from 552 until 624. Spania was created after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. During this time, Visgothic and Suebi people had took over the Iberian Peninsula.

Byzantine emperor Justinian I tried to restore the western provinces of the Empire. Spania was established in what is now the Balearic Islands and southern Andalusia.

Copan brook frog

The Copan brook frog ("Duellmanohyla soralia") is a frog. It lives in Honduras and Guatemala. Scientists have seen it between 40 and 1200 meters above sea level in Honduras and between 725 and 1200 m above sea level in Guatemala.

The adult male frog is 26.8-32 mm long from nose to rear end and the largest adult female frogs are 38 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is brown with green and black marks. The iris of the eye is red in color.

The tadpoles swim in pools in mountain streams where the water moves slowly.

This frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives to collect wood for building. Diseases can also kill this frog. For example, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog.

The frog's scientific name comes from the Greek language word "soralia," which is about lichen. The marks on the frog's back make scientists think of lichen.

Single-stage-to-orbit

A single-stage-to-orbit (abbreviated as SSTO) is a hypothetical spacecraft. It can reach space from the surface of a planet without expending major pieces of the craft (such as engines, fuel tanks, or wings). As of November 2022, no SSTOs have successfully made it to space from Earth's surface; all space launches so far have been performed by rockets with multiple stages.

SSTOs have been supposed to hold many advantages over rockets. The main one is their reusability. Most launch systems are expendable (meaning that they are used once and not reused or recovered), with some exception of partially reusable launch systems (such as NASA's Space Shuttle or SpaceX's Falcon Heavy). Such partially reusable launch systems have significantly reduced many peoples' interest in SSTOs, because they dramatically lower launch costs using already proven technology that doesn't need expensive development.

It is generally considered possible for a rocket-powered SSTO to reach Earth orbit, so long as the many technical challenges with SSTOs can be solved sometime in the future. The main complications with SSTOs are:


All of these challenges have to be solved, made to work in a singular vehicle with little to no expenditure of hardware, and with some breathing room left over for the weight of the craft's payload. Doing so is a hard challenge. Scientists have been finding solutions for decades.
Assuming these challenges can be solved, it is likely that the regular maintenance costs of an SSTO would be very high. This is for multiple reasons; not only would the craft need to be refueled after every flight, any hull damage sustained during flight (specifically atmospheric reentry) would need to be fixed with absolute precision and no mistakes, every time, in order to prevent a catastrophic failure of the craft.

To reach the speeds needed to achieve Earth orbit in one stage, an SSTO would have to take advantage of highly advanced propulsion technology, such as scramjets or hybrid-cycle rocket engines.

Multiple SSTO concepts have been purported, and some have even begun the early stages of development.

The Skylon is a proposed SSTO that was first revealed in 1993. The Skylon would be propelled by two hybrid-cycle rocket engines. They are called SABRE engines. The SABRE engines would have two modes of operation: in atmosphere, they would act as airbreathing engines; at very high altitudes (approaching the edge of Earth's atmosphere), they would switch to a closed cycle rocket mode, using on-board liquid oxidizer to continue fuel combustion and propel the craft.

Skylon is still in very early development; very little funding for its development has been secured. A prototype functional SABRE engine has yet to be built.

Although not technically meant to be an SSTO, Elon Musk has said that the SpaceX Starship's upper stage could reach low Earth orbit on its own. It would, however, have little to no fuel left for orbital maneuvering or return to Earth's surface, no landing gear, no heat shield, and no usable payload.

NGC 55

NGC 55 is a Magellanic type barred spiral galaxy located about 6.5 million light years away in the constellation Sculptor. Along with its neighbor NGC 300, it is one of the closest galaxies to the Local Group, probably lying between the Milky Way and the Sculptor Group. It has an estimated mass of (2.0 ± 0.4) × 10 "M".

NGC 55 and the spiral galaxy NGC 300 have permanently been identified as members of the Sculptor Group, a nearby group of galaxies in the constellation of Sculptor. However, recent distance measurements point to that the two galaxies actually lie in the foreground.

It is likely that NGC 55 and NGC 300 form a gravitationally bound pair.

Grimm's law

Grimm's law is the name for sound laws in Proto-Indo-Germanic languages. In the first century BC some sounds in these languages changed. The law is named after the German linguist Jacob Grimm who described these changes in the early 19th century.

It is known that almost all modern European languages originated in (grew out of) early Indo-European language. Proto-Indo-European (PIE) is the reconstructed common ancestor of these modern languages.

Grimm's law is sometimes called first Germanic sound shift. There also was a second Germanic sound shift, which mostly affected German dialects, and happened much later.

Jacob Grimm based his theory on Danish philologist Rasmus Christian Rask’s "essay On the Origin of the Icelandic Language". He examined the relationship between consonants in Germanic languages and other Indo-European languages such as Latin or French. The results of the change in consonants are still visible in English, Dutch, and the Scandinavian languages.

A chain shift is a series of interrelated sound changes. The assumption behind the chain shift is that all the phonemes of a language build a balanced system so that a change in one part of the system can cause changes in its other parts.

Many chain shifts are vowel shifts, because many sets of vowels are naturally arranged on a multi-value scale (e.g. vowel height or frontness). However, chain shifts can also occur in consonants. The modern word "apple" used to be pronounced with "b" (Gaulish "abalom" or Lithuanian "obuolỹs"), a change that occurred with Grimm's law.

Therefore, in terms of consonants, the shift from PIE to Proto-Germanic (PG) can be split into three stages:

The first group of voiceless stop consonants:

All the words that consisted of the presented consonants were affected by Grimm's law. Some words may have only undergone one or two of the changes, while others may have undergone all of them.
The impact of the first Germanic sound shift can be followed across most of the Germanic languages. We can see that many words are, due to the shift, similar (in sound and meaning). Grimm's law provides an insight into why and how core words sound so similar in Germanic languages, yet are in some respects quite distinct from other Indo-European languages:



These changes also could have created consonant clusters, as in words which contain two or more consonants:



It is not possible to exactly say, when it happened. Most people say that this was around 500 BC. This is because that are several loanwords, in Germanic languages, which do not occur before the 5th century BC. There are some examples, that the shift completed in the 1st century BC.

Honduran brook frog

The Honduran brook frog ("Duellmanohyla salvavida") is a frog. It lives in Honduras. Scientists have seen it between 90 and 1400 m above sea level in Honduras in rainforests.

The adult male frog is 25.1-28 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 34 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is green in color, light or dark. The belly is yellow. There is a white stripe on the face underneath the eye. The stripe goes down the side of the body. There is a whitish spot above the place where the legs meet the body. The insides of the legs are light yellow in color. The iris of the eye is red in color.

This frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives. They cut down trees to make farms and towns. Droughts can kill this frog. Floods can kill this frog. Other animals, including some animals brought to the area by humans by accident can eat this frog. Climate change can kill this frog because there is more ultraviolet light. Diseases kill this frog. For example, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog.

The scientific name of this frog, "salvavida", means "lifesaver." The scientists named it after a Honduran beer called Salvavida.

Ayyubid Sultanate

The Ayyubid Sultanate (Arabic: الأيوبيون "al-Ayyūbīyūn"; Kurdish: ئەیووبیەکان, Eyûbiyan) wss dynasty of Kurdish origin that ruled Egypt, Syria, the Jazira and the Yemen in the 12th and 13th centuries. The name of the dynasty is attributed to Ayyub b. Shadhi, the father of Saladin. The Ayyūbids played a significant role in the history of the region, notably ending Fatimid, uniting Syria and Egypt, and defeating the Crusaders. 
Saladin, founder of the dynasty, was Kurdish and the former vizier of Fatimid Caliphate.

Bosworth states that the Ayyubids belonged to the Hadhbani tribe of the Kurds, but argues that the Ayyubids were considerably Arabized. Humphreys also identifies Saladin as a Kurd and the Ayyubids as a Kurdish family, but argues that the Ayyubids were not specifically a Kurdish state, and that at the level of political structure, the governing attitudes of the Ayyubid confederation were not significantly different from those of previous Arab states such as the Abbasids and Fatimids, which can certainly be attributed to the political institutions of their original homeland, Humphreys as well as taking into account Minorsky's speculations on the "Arab origins" of the Ayyubids. Tabaa, on the other hand, argues that over time the Ayyubids drastically moved away from their Kurdish origins and became decidedly Arabised. 

Various medieval historians spoke of Saladin's Kurdishness:

His claim to the Brazilian throne and the headship of the Imperial House was challenged by his cousin Pedro Gastão, Prince of Brazil. He considered Prince Pedro de Alcântara's renounce to has no legal validation, but Pedro Henrique's legitimacy was nonetheless widely recognized by the Brazilian monarchists and international royalty and confirmed by the Brazilian Monarchical Directory, the official monarchist organ in Brazil, as for the monarchist action movement called Patrianovismo.

During his lifetime he was actively engaged in promote the monarchist cause in Brazil.

Luís, Prince Imperial of Brazil

He was exiled along with his family as the result of the 1889 coup d'état that resulted in the formation of the republic. In 1908, the year he married, his older brother Pedro renounced his claim to succeed his mother in her claim to the imperial throne, leaving "Dom" Luís as her heir. In this role he worked with monarchists in Brazil in several attempts to restore the monarchy. At the outbreak of World War I he enlisted as an officer with the British Armed Forces and saw action in Flanders where he contracted a virulent form of rheumatism that caused his death at the age of 42. His efforts on behalf of the Allies of World War I saw him decorated by Belgium, France and Great Britain.

Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil

Isabel was born in Rio de Janeiro, the eldest daughter of Emperor Pedro II and Empress Teresa Cristina, and thus she was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: "Bragança"). After the deaths of her two brothers in infancy, she was recognized as her father's heiress presumptive. She married a French prince, Gaston, Count of Eu, in an arranged marriage and they had three sons.

During her father's absences abroad, Isabel acted as regent. In her third and final regency, she actively promoted and ultimately signed a law, named "Lei Áurea" or the Golden Law, emancipating all slaves in Brazil. Even though the action was broadly popular, there was strong opposition to her succession to the throne by the conservative elites. Her gender, strong Catholic faith and marriage to a foreigner were seen as impediments against her. The emancipation of the slaves generated dislike among powerful planters. In 1889, her family was deposed in a military coup. Then she spent the last 30 years of her life in exile in France.

Dactyl (moon)

Dactyl (designated (243) Ida I Dactyl) is a tiny asteroid moon which is 1.6 km in diameter and orbits the asteroid 243 Ida in the asteroid belt. It was first imaged by the Galileo spacecraft on August 28, 1993; Dactyl was discovered while examining the delayed image downloads from the Galileo spacecraft on February 17, 1994. It was provisionally designated S/1993 (243) 1. The small moon was named after the mythical creatures called dactyls who lived on Mount Ida according to Greek mythology.

Dactyl orbits the asteroid, Ida, with a period of 1.54 days at an average distance of 108 km, with an inclination of 9° to Ida's equator.

Dactyl was the first asteroid moon discovered. Its discovery settled the long discuss over the existence of asteroid moons.

The origins of Dactyl are unclear, but two main hypotheses exist. The first is that Dactyl and Ida formed at the same time, and the second is that Dactyl was knocked loose by a later impact.

Cult of personality

Sometimes, governments create idealized images of people. Very often, these people are current or former leaders of the country. What will then result is a cult of personality, or cult of the leader. Techniques such as mass media, propaganda, fake news, spectacle, the arts and patriotism are used to create this image. The leader is shown as a hero, with few or no negative traits. Social engineering is also used very often, especially in sta in one-party states and dominant-party states. A cult of personality often accompanies the leader of a totalitarian or authoritarian countries. It can also be seen in some monarchies, theocracies, and failed democracies.

Categorization

Categorization is the fact that people recognize similarities of different things, and put these things into groups, called categories. Categorization is one of the most fundamental cognitive abilities. As such it is studied by psychologists and people interested in behaviour. People form these categories either because of other things they know (pre-existing knowledge), or by comparing them with other similar entities. 

While the categories use in science rarely have exceptions, categories in everyday life often do. 

As an example: Neither Rheas nor ostriches can fly, yet even children will classify them as birds. 

Today, scientists tell us that other animals, such as the great apes, horses or even doves have the ability to form categories.

Pickleball

Pickleball is an American sport created in 1965. It was originally a backyard game for kids in Washington State, USA. It is similar to tennis, table tennis, and paddleball.

Players use solid paddles to hit a perforated and hollow ball. The equipment limits how hard and far they can hit it.

Here are the basic rules:
The ball must be served underhanded and to the opponent's opposite service court to the one you are serving from. The ball must not bounce on your side.

Only the serving side scores. You must alternate sides when serving. The server serves until the serving side faults. You must hit at least one ground-stroke before approaching the net to volley.

The first side to 11 points, with at least a two-point lead, wins. If both teams reach 10 at the same time then the game will continue until 15. This could go up to 21 points if one side still fails to get a points lead. The scoring of pickleball can also help to determine the sides in case you are playing as doubles. As you know, whenever a team scores, both teams switch court sides with each other. So, if your score is Even you must have to be on the court where you started the game and if the score is in Odd you must be in the other court.

Extragalactic planet

An extragalactic planet, known as an extragalactic exoplanet or an extroplanet, is a star-bound planet or rogue planet located outside of the Milky Way Galaxy. Due to the very far distances to such worlds, they would be very hard to detect instantly. However, indirect evidence suggests that such far planets exist. Nonetheless, the most distant planets known are SWEEPS-11 and SWEEPS-04, these two stars are located in Sagittarius with a distance of approximately 27,710 light years from the Sun, while the Milky Way is between 100,000 and 180,000 light years in diameter. This means that even galactic planets located farther than that distance have not been detected.

Hu Jintao's removal from the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party

Portrait of the mother (Boccioni)

Portrait of the mother (also known as Ritratto della madre) is a 20th-century late filippinism painted in oil by Umberto boccioni. It was painted in 1910, in Via Adige in Milano, Italy. Is in the collection of the Museum Galleria d'arte moderna Ricci Oddi of Piacenza.

Umberto Boccioni was inspired by the work "Portrait of the mother" by Francesco Filippini to create the portrait of his mother, of which he was an attentive observer of his art exhibitions and for this reason it maintains a naturalistic structure typical of the Filipino artistic movement which then becomes the basis of the works of full Futurism. Boccioni then portrayed his mother several times. 
The work of Boccioni's Portrait of the Mother is linked to the painting "Materia" (1912) and "Horizontal Volumes" (1911-1912).
The painting of Boccioni's Mother in the Ricci Oddi Museum therefore marks a moment of transition between the Divisionist phase and that, also inspired by Cubism, which proposes a decisive overcoming of traditional aesthetics. 

The full stylistic adherence to Boccioni's futurism takes place with the stylistic turning point with the painting «The city that rises» created in 1910 in Via Adige in Milan (Fondazione Prada district).



Greater bromeliad tree frog

The greater bromeliad tree frog ("Bromeliohyla dendroscarta") is a frog. It lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it between 450 and 1900 meters above sea level.

The adult frog can be as big as 35 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin on the frog's back can be yellow in color with small brown spots to green. The iris of the eye is gold in color. The belly is yellow in color.

Tadpoles are whitish in color. Their bellies are clear.

The tadpoles only eat dead things, for example dead insects, that fall into the water in the bromeliad plants.

This frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places it lives. Human beings cut down trees in the forests where it lives to collect wood for building, to make towns, to make farms, and to make places for animals to eat grass. Climate change and ultraviolet light can also kill this frog. Diseases can also kill this frog.

India fungus epidemic

The Fungus epidemic in India spread out in the central region of India. More than 200 people have fallen ill due to mucormycosis disease. Due to the increase in cases of the second wave of COVID-19, some regions had more diseases. The WHO has warned that the fungal disease is spreading elsewhere, in the third wave of COVID-19 in India.

Fungal disease or Mucormycosis has spread in several regions and provinces of India in: New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashta, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

It is a type of Mucormycosis Fungus with zygomycosis that causes loss of vision and entering the human brain, redness and inflammation of other parts of the body, nasal allergies, bleeding and vomiting, occasional cough with blood in the saliva and shortness of breath.

Fungus is a type of fungal disease that attacks the internal organs of a person. It often affects diabetics, weak immunity, high blood, sinuses. The fungus also attacks those who have recovered from COVID-19 or COVID-19 patients. Fungal is acquired in unhygienic environments.

Island arc

Island arcs are those well-known series of islands with volcanoes (such as the Ring of Fire). They are usually caused by tectonic plate boundaries passing over geologic hot spots in the Earth's crust.

Well-known examples are the Hawaiian Islands, the Japanese Archipelago, the Philippine Islands, and the Yellowstone hotspot.

Plates moving together cause one plate to go under another, and another to go on top. This makes a string of islands because the hot spots stay still while the plates move over them. Essentially the same phenomenon occurred in "dead" island chains like the Galapagos Islands, yet is still live elsewhere. All these chains are made by land moving over hot-spots in the Earth's crust, not by the hotspots moving. The position of a hotspot seems independent of tectonic plate boundaries.

On North America the Cascade volcanos look like they are active because they have been swept up by the westward movement of the Americas. 

A mantle plume is a proposed mechanism of convection in the Earth's mantle. This means there are places where the Earth's inner heat comes up, where more usually it does not.

Bromeliohyla melacaena

Bromeliohyla melacaena is a frog. It lives in Honduras. Scientists have seen it in pine forests between 1370 and 1990 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 21.8 - 22.6 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 24.2 - 25.9 mm long. The adult male frog has spikes on its thumbs.

The adult male frogs and adult female frogs look different. The adult male frogs are light brown with yellow spots with some light green marks. The bones are white and can be seen through the skin. The legs are light brown. The belly is white. The adult female frog is dark brown with a light brown stripe between the eyes. The nose is yellow-green in color. The female frog has a lighter belly than the male frog. They eyes are orange with black spots in both male and female frogs.

Scientists think this frog move around at night and hide in bromeliad plants during the day. They have not seen any tadpoles, but they think the frogs put them in bromeliad plants.

This frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives by cutting down trees to collect wood for building and to make towns, farms, and places for animals to eat grass. Droughts and floods can kill this frog. Chemicals meant to kill pests can kill this frog by accident. So can fertilizers and pollution. Diseases and ultraviolet light can kill this frog. For example, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog.

The scientific name of this frog "melacaena" comes from two Greek language words meaning "black" and "thorn or spine." The scientists named it after the black spike on the male frogs' thumbs.

1st Provisional Marine Brigade

The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was a brigade in the United States Marine Corps. It was founded in 1912 and was disbanded on September 13, 1951. It was not made as a permanent unit in the United States Marine Corps, but it served as an Ad Hoc unit.

When they were first founded, they were sent in to fight in the "Negro Rebellion" in Cuba. Then they fought in World War II in Iceland where they had no real action, but in Guam they fought alongside the 1st Marine Division. After the war ended, they were disbanded, then fought in the Korean War.

They were quickly reactivated during 1950 for the Korean War. They fought in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, as well as the Battle of Yongsan. After their time in the Korean War, they were disbanded shortly after they returned home. The Brigade earned multiple streamers throughout its history.

The Negro Rebellion happened in 1912, the year the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was formed. The Negro Rebellion was a war where Black Cubans rioted and fought the Cuban Government for freedom and equality. The Cuban Government requested support from the United States - the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was sent to guard certain locations.

A small regiment named the 1st Provisional Marine Regiment was commanded by colonel Lincoln Karmany. The regiment was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 22nd. It numbered around 450 men. There was also the 2nd Provisional Marine Regiment that was created at the same time, led by Colonel James Mahoney in Key West, Florida. It numbered about 750 men.

They both came to Cuba in the USS Prairie, which was an amphibious transport ship made to transport marines and assets. The 1st Battalion of the 2nd Provisional Marine Regiment was in Havana, Cuba, but the rest were in Guantanamo. They protected American farms in Siboney and El Cobre. After the rebellion stopped they left.

The first Regiments soon became the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in June. They were led by now Colonel Lincoln Karmany.

The 1st Marine Brigade was a very different Brigade that was made in 1935, but people got confused because they also were in Cuba in 1940. It was first made in 1913 as a unit in the 1st Advance Force Brigade, but they weren't "Provisional." They were in Mexico and Puerto Rico. When it was disbanded, people confused the two.

In May of 1940, the United Kingdom invaded Iceland even if they were neutral. They invaded because they were scared that Germany would attack Iceland. The Natives didn't like the British because of that, but they liked the Americans more. Iceland signed an agreement with the United States so that they were defended. As soon as it happened, the United States Marine Corps quickly reactivated the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade on July 14th, 1941. The first people to join were taken from the 2nd Marine Division, and they were trained and organized in Camp Elliott in San Diego.

They had about 4,095 men. They were some of the first men to enter Iceland under Major General Holland M. Smith. They stayed there with the 1st Marine Division, but the 1st MD was called to fight somewhere else, so the United States Army were the ones to come in after the 1st MD left to help the occupation. The 1st PMB also left with the 1st Marine Division.

Now under Brigadier General John Marston and Colonel Leo D. Hermle, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade sailed from San Diego to Charleston in attack transports, the USS Heywood, USS William P. Biddle, and USS Fuller. They also met other ships on the way that carried supplies for the 1st PMB. Those ships were the USS Arkansas, USS New York, USS Brooklyn and USS Nashville. They stopped at Newfoundland then continued to Iceland. They landed in Reykjavík on July 7th. They helped the British 49th Infantry Division.

The British commanders split the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade evenly around Reykjavík and places next to it. They were made into an emergency force in case of German invasion. The 49th ID also gave their own patch to the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade. The 1st PMB were also with the United States Army and Army Air Corps. They made a lot of forts to stop any German invasion for most of their time there. On September 22nd, 1940, the British left Iceland and the United States Army was commanding the place.

During the Winter of 1941 and 1940, nothing happened, and their progress became slow after they lost a lot of their supplies making forts and doing combat drills for if the Germans attacked. However, the Germans did not attack, and no planes were sent except for unarmed ones for reconnaissance.

After Pearl Harbor, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was moved away and sent to fight in the Pacific. They came back to New York in the USS McCawley and SS Borinquen. A lot of the former marines in the 1st PMB joined the 2nd Marine Division to fight in the Guadalcanal Campaign.

On April 18th of 1944, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was activated again, but this time to fight in Guadalcanal. They were a reserve force for a bit, and they were commanded by Brigadier General Lemuel C. Shepherd. In July, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade went to the Marshall Islands for the Invasion of Guam. Guam was under the Empire of Japan. They waited for a bit then they got about 9,886 men and had the 4th and 22nd Marine Regiment join them. They joined the Third Amphibious Corps, which had almost 60,000 men and they would attack Guam, the 305th Infantry Regiment also joined.

They were preparing in the Eniwetok Atoll, which is in the Marshall Islands. At 08:32 AM on the 21st of July, the 22nd Marine Regiment landed in Bangi Point, Hågat which was in the West. They started to fight some of the 22,000 Japanese men on the Island of Guam. Most of the fights were in the West, since it was where most of the Japanese soldiers were. But the main 1st PMB didn't have much fighting. The Japanese soldiers had a lot of fortifications with Type 41 Mountain Guns and Bunkers, and reconnaissance did not see them.

The Japanese soldiers used Type 41 Mountain Cannons that shoot 75mm rounds against the 22nd Marine Regiment. They also used them against 20 amphibious vehicles to stop them from moving. The 22nd Marine Regiment spent most of the day fighting the Japanese in Hågat. The 1st Battalion finally took Hågat while the 2nd Battalion took Mount Alifan. Also the 1st Battalion, the 4th Marines Regiment took over Bangi Point with help of the 3rd Battalion. They both started to move forward to Mount Alifan but Japanese resistance on the island delayed them. The Japanese tried to make a big counter-offensive at night but failed.

By the end of the day, the 4th and 22nd Regiments took places about 2,000 meters or 6,000 feet inside Guam. The The 305th Regimental Combat Team helped the Marines for about 3 or 4 days before they regrouped with the 77th Infantry Division that was in the North. The 1st Brigade, 3rd Marine Division was in the south and the 77th Infantry Division cut off and split the Orote Peninsula. By July 29th, they fully cleared the place and killed about 2,500 Japanese soldiers. The 4th Marines were in the right of the West Flank while the 22nd Marine Regiment was on the left of the East Flanks, they quickly killed off the Japanese.

On August 6th, the Japanese made a last stand, meaning that they stayed in their positions and fought until they died. Mount Santa Rosa was cleared on August 8th and Ritidian Point and Pati Point on August 10th. BY 11:32 AM of August 10th, the Island was officially clear after 11,000 Japanese soldiers died. The 1st PMB was disbanded and the men there were moved to the 6th Marine Division.

After World War II, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade became way smaller and had men, their name would change to 1st Provisional Artillery Battalion on 11th October, 1947. They used to be a Brigade, but became a Battalion, which has about 1,000 men and it became something called a "paper unit". Some of the men that used to be in the Brigade became a part of the 1st Battalion, 11th Marines.

During the Korean War, the United States Marine Corps was becoming smaller and they weren't prepared for the Korean War. During 25 of June, 1950, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (the people who lead the Military) told the Marines to get a 15,000 man division to help the United Nations Command (a group of countries fighting in the war). The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was the first unit to be sent to Korea, under General Edward A. Craig. 

The United States Marine Corps prepared the 1st Marine Division and other units to fight in the war. On July 7th, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was reactivated in California to fight in the war. One week later, they arrived in Pusan. Edward A. Craig was leading them and they were helped by Marine Aircraft Group 33. They fought a lot in the south of Korea.

The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was immediately sent to Masan. They were sent to the westernmost flank of The Pusan Perimeter. The Eighth Army set up to resist the North Korean Army, which was trying to overwhelm United Nation Forces. The 1st PMB joined the 5th Regimental Combat Team and 25th Infantry Division under Major General William B. Kean. The three units of about 20,000 men banded together and made "Task Force Kean."

General Walker and the Eight Army were about to make the first counter offensive by the United Nations. They were going to start by taking Chinju from the North Korean 6th Division. The attack the Geumgang River in the middle of the month. One of Walker's goals was to stop North Koreans from grouping together next to Taegu. He wanted to do this by pushing some of the enemies south to keep them away. On August 6th, the Eighth Army was allowed to attack. The plan was to move west near Masan, take The Chinju Pass, and capture the Nam River, but it depended on the arrival of a few battalions of tanks from the 2nd Infantry Divisions.

Task Force Kean started on August 7th and left Masan. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade rushed Pansong and the North Korean 6th Division Headquarters. There were 350 casualties on the North Korean side. But the other units in Task Force Kean were slowed down by North Korean resistance. The Task Force attacked Jindong-myeon which led to a weird battle where the 6th North Korean Division had air support and airdrops while Task Force Kean kept meeting the 6th Division and fighting.

A lot of fighting happened in three days, and by August 9th, Task Force Kean was sure that they could take Jinju-si. Even if there was a lot of North Korean resistance, they were supported by airstrikes. On August 10th, Task Force Kean started to advance and met the North Korean 83rd Motorized Regiment, 105th Armored Division. They were surprised and tried to retreat, but F4U Corsairs from the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing attacked them multiple times. 200 men were killed and over 100 vehicles were destroyed.

The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade couldn't continue and were redeployed somewhere else on August 12th, but Task Force Kean kept on going and took Chondong-ni. The 8th Army needed some help in Taegu, specifically in the Naktong Bulge. By August 14th, Task Force Kean failed it's objective of splitting the North Koreans at the Chinju pass. The North Korean 9th Division was almost gone, they had gone down to about 3000-4000 men. But the North Korean Army drafted South Koreans from Andong.

In the First Naktong Bulge, the 1st PMB had to help stop a stalemate between the 24th Infantry Division and the North Korean 4th Infantry Division because the Americans kept shooting. They started on midnight of August 6th. The North Korean 4th Division had started to move across the Naktong River at the Ohang ferry site. They used their heads and rafts to carry their weapons. At 2 AM on August 6th, the 4th Division started fighting the 3rd Battalion of the 34th Infantry Regiment. The 3rd Battalion had to retreat, and the North Koreans moved forward and tried to take down Yongsan.
They took a lot of weapons from the Americans because they surprised them. The Americans thought that they would attack from the far north.

A lot of American attacks caused stalemates. On the morning of August 7th, the North Koreans were able to take over Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge. The place had bad terrain and it made a Bulge. At 4 PM, the 9th Infantry Regiment of the 2nd Infantry Division were sent there. The 24th Infantry Division, commanded by Major General John H. Church, ordered the attack of the Naktong Bulge. On the morning of August 7th, the North Koreans took over Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge.

The 4th Division of North Korea was making underwater bridges made of sandbags, trees and rocks. It was strong enough to handle tanks and heavy things like artillery. By August 10th, two entire regiments went over the river and took positions. The attack showed that the North Koreans could attack Yongsan, which forced the United States to send reinforcements. There were lots of deaths there, then General Walker sent the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the Naktong, They prepared to attack Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni, at 8 AM on August 17th. The 1st PMB sent all their men to attack; they used M26 tanks, airstrikes and mortars to help them.

At first, the North Koreans stopped a lot of the attack, but then they were overwhelmed by the heavy fire that was targeting them. The 1st PMB started to take one hill at a time. The Marines took Obong-ni first, then they destroyed a lot of enemies there with airstrikes. They destroyed all of the 18th Regiment. The North Korean 4th Divisions tactics and strategies didn't work very well so they couldn't use them.

By August 18th, the Americans took Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill. The North Korean 4th Division only had about 300 or 400 men left, after starting with 700 men. The rest either surrendered or ran away because they didn't want to get captured.

In the Second Naktong Bulge, the 1st PMB only had 4,290 men, because about 500 men were killed in a month of war. They were getting ready to go to Pusan to escape to Japan, but they joined other Marines in the 1st Marine Division that would attack Ichon. They could not come because they were about to fight in Naktong. General Walker called them to help the 2nd Infantry Division in Naktong, but McArhut didn't like it because it would anger the East Command. They still fought. The attack was a threat to the supply line.

The 2nd Division took the river line in Naktong, and the 1st PMB rushed the river with everything they had. They planned their attack very well and won. After they helped the 2nd Infantry Division, they destroyed the North Korean army at the Naktong River then left as soon as the battle ended.

During a meeting between the 2nd Division, Eighth Army and 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, they all agreed to launch an attack at 8 AM on September 3rd at the Yongsan–Naktong River road. The Marines were going to attack the south, while the Army would attack the north. Their goal was to get in contact with the 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division, and 72nd Tank Battalion.

The 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines and 1st Battalion, 5th Marines came to Yongsan while the 1st PMB was moved to the front of Yongsan. The 1st PMB was under control of the 2nd Division. At night, the A Company of the 2nd Engineers fought a lot with the Korean People's Army. At dawn on September 3rd, the A Company gained high ground and fought the entrenched Koreans. The company leader was hit with a grenade and injured by it. They later took over the hill with the help of tanks.

The Marines started an attack across some rice farms. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines attacked the southern east-west and took an objective after the North Koreans were attacked by airstrikes and crossed to where the 2nd Battalion was. Airstrikes, machine gun fire, artillery and the 1st Battalion started to shoot the North Korean reinforcements. The 1st Battalion moved to another hill.

In the north, the 2nd Battalion took longer. They started to get a lot of fire when they went up about 3.2 km. The D Company, 2nd Battalion was isolated and some tanks were taking down North Korean T-34s. The North Korean crewmen abandoned 1/5th of all their armored vehicles. By the end of the day, the 2nd Battalion entrenched and lost 95 men. Most of them were from the D Company. 

The 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines was allowed to pass the 2nd Battalion and continue fighting in the morning. When the morning came, the North Koreans retreated and the 1st Battalion occupied some tents that looked like a command post. They quickly saw T-34 tanks that were abandoned and in good condition. At night, the North Koreans attacked the place and hit G Company hard. When it started to rain they slowed down. The North Koreans surrounded the G Company and some started hand to hand combat. The 9th Infantry came in and helped the Marines.

On September 5th, after 10-minute-long artillery preparations, the Americans started to move out in the rain. They moved to Obong-ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry came close to Cloverleaf Hill that was captured in the First Battle of Naktong Bulge. They saw some North Koreans going up. The marines split and took the pass between both hills.

About 300 North Koreans came in from the village of Tugok and started to fight the B Company. Some T-34s attacked by surprise and took out 2 M-26 Pershing Tanks. The B Company had to retreat, but the A and C Companies fought the North Koreans with mortars. By the end of the day, there were 1,245 casualties and 106 of them were marines. The number of North Korean deaths is unknown.

By September 4th, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was released from the 2nd Division by General Walker. He thought that he had enough men to continue on with his mission.

After the Battle of Yongsan, General Walker released the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade from control of the 2nd Division. On September 5th, the 1st PMB started to leave Yongsan, then they joined the 7th Marine Regiment and 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division since the 1st Marine Division was being reformed. MacArthur said that he could not fight in Inchon if there were no Marines, so he sent some to the Army's 65th Infantry Regiment and 17th Infantry Regiment.

The Brigade had different sizes every time it was reactivated, but usually there was a Headquarters and Service Company. They also had companies much smaller than normal, and they would have a military police, and support companies. There were also signal companies and platoons. During the Negro Rebellion, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade had about 1,200 men that was in two separate regiments.

When the 1st PMB went to Iceland they had more men, these were 1st, 2nd, and 3rd battalions from the 6th Marine Regiment, the 2nd battalion the 10th Marine Regiment, the A company from the 2nd Tank Battalion, the A company from the 2nd Service Battalion, and the entire 5th Marine Defense Battalion.

When they went to Guam they had a very big brigade of 9,886 men. It had the 4th Marine Regiment, the 22nd Marine Regiment, a military police company, a signals platoon and an Artillery Battalion consisting of 4 batteries. The 53rd Naval Construction Battalion was also assigned to the Brigade.

In the Korean War, they had about 4,725 men: the 5th Marine Regiment's 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions, the 1st Combat Engineer Battalion, the 1st Medical Battalion, the 1st Motor Transport Battalion, the 1st Ordnance Battalion, the 1st Service Battalion, the 1st Shore Party Battalion, the 1st Signal Battalion, the 1st Tank Battalion, the 1st Amphibian Tractor Company, and the 1st Combat Service Group. They also had support from the Marine Aircraft Group 33.

Even though the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade wasn't permanent, it still got streamers for its service and actions in Cuba, Iceland, Guam, Pusan, Yongsan and Naktong. These "streamers" or awards include:

X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology

X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology, or XROMM, is a scientific research technique. Scientists use XROMM to make 3D movies of animals' bones while they are still alive.

In XROMM, a surgeon puts radio-opaque bone markers inside the animal's body. Then an X-ray video system can tell exactly where the markers are. This helps the scientists make very good videos of how the bones move.

Scientists at Brown University invented XROMM in 2010.

XROMM can be used to show birds in flight, humans running, frogs jumping, and a toad swallowing crickets.

HV 888

HV 888 (also known as WOH S140), is a red supergiant star in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It is among the largest known stars. It has a solar radius from over 1,400 to nearly 2,000 times that of the Sun. 

It is one of the most luminous of its type. Its luminosity is nearly 300,000 to over 500,000 times that of the luminosity of our Sun. The effective temperature is estimated to be around 3,500 K. If it was placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would engulf the orbit of Jupiter and possibly even Saturn.

HV 888 is located in the constellation of Dorado with an apparent magnitude of 11.861, It has a diameter of between 1,027,548,900 to 1,373,311,800 km.

Fomalhaut is located about 25 light years from the Sun as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.

It is classified as a Vega-like star that throws out excess infrared radiation. This shows that the star is surrounded by a circumstellar disk. Fomalhaut, Fomalhaut b, and red dwarf star Formalhaut c make up a triple system, even though they are separated by about 8 degrees.

Effective temperature

The effective temperature of an astronomical body like a star or a planet is the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total amount of electromagnetic radiation. Effective temperature is often used as an estimate of a body's surface temperature when the body's emissivity curve (as a function of wavelength) is not known.

When the star's or planet's net emissivity in the relevant wavelength band is less than that of a black body, the actual temperature of the body will be higher than the effective temperature. The net emissivity may be low due to surface or atmospheric properties, including the greenhouse effect.

Ruzhany Palace

Ruzhany Palace (, ) is a ruined palace in Ruzhany village, Pruzhany Raion (district), Brest Voblast (province) in western Belarus. 

It was the main residence of the Polish-Lithuanian Sapieha noble family. The palace is currently and slowly being renovated. The palace gate and entry building are already renovated.

The first Ruzhany Palace was built by Lew Sapieha in 1602. The palace was destroyed during the civil war in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1700.
Ruzhany Palace was rebuilt in the Baroque and Neoclassical style in the 1770s, by Aleksander Michał Sapieha, employing the German architect Jan Samuel Becker of Saxony, who also designed an English-style garden around the palace. Aside from the palace, there was a theatre (1784–1788), an orangery and several other buildings. Becker also designed the local church (rebuilt in the 1850s).

The last King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Stanisław II, visited the palace in 1784. By that time work on the palace was stopped. In 1795, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was invaded and destroyed by the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria. Then the land was divided among them. The palace, which was in the eastern part of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, became part of Russia.

The Sapieha estates were nationalized after the November Uprising by the Polish against the Russian Empire in 1831. In 1834, the palace was sold to be used as a textile mill and weaving factory.
In 1914, the palace was accidentally set on fire by factory workers. The First World War and financial problems prevented the building's renovation until 1930. However the partially restored palace became a ruin again during the Second World War. The palace gate and the entry building were renovated in 2012.

Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign

The 2024 presidential campaign of Donald Trump was announced by Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election on November 15, 2022.

Trump is currently seeking the nomination for the Republican primaries. If he is elected, he will become the second president after Grover Cleveland to serve two non-consecutive presidential terms.

After Joe Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election, Trump became the first incumbent president since the 1992 presidential election to lose his reelection bid. Trump also became the first president since George H. W. Bush to serve one presidential term.

After he lost the 2020 election, Trump refused to concede to Biden and accept his loss. He later made widespread false claims of election and voter fraud, and saying it was rigged and stolen from him, despite no evidence to support his claims.

Trump later made many attempts to overturn the election results, to prevent Biden's presidential transition and block the certification of his election victory, which later resulted in the attack on the United States Capitol, which left five people dead and later resulted in his second impeachment, becoming the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.

Trump left office on January 20, 2021, and became the first outgoing president since 1869, who did not attend his successor's inauguration.

On November 15, 2022, he announced his candidacy for 2024 presidential election.

This also officially makes Trump's fourth presidential campaign, as he ran for president in 2000, 2016, 2020, and is running again in 2024.

This later caused wide speculation that both Trump and Biden may face a potential rematch in the 2024 election. If Trump and Biden are renominated, this would be the first presidential rematch since the 1956 presidential election.

As of 2023, there are multiple factors working against Trump such as, the hearings of the January 6 Committee, FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, Raffensperger phone call, Stormy Daniels scandal, and his indictment by the New York grand jury.

Aplastodiscus

The Canebrake tree frogs (Aplastodiscus) are a group of frogs in the family Hylidae. They live in southeastern Brazil near the Atlantic Ocean. One frog, Aplastodiscus pervirdis, also lives in Argentina, and it might live in Paraguay.

At first, "Aplastodiscus" had two frog species in it. In 2005, frog scientists looked at Hylidae again and decided that 12 more frogs should go into "Aplastodiscus". They moved them into "Aplastodiscus" from "Hyla". Now, there are 16 species in "Aplastodiscus".

There are currently 16 species in "Aplastodiscus":

Currently, none of the species are in danger of dying out. But there are fewer of some frogs than others. Human beings change the places where they live to build houses, farms, and towns. Pollution, climate change, and disease can also hurt these frogs. Some invasive species can kill this frog. Many of the species are data deficient. That means that scientists do not know enough about them to know if they are in danger or not.

Angklung

The angklung is an Indonesian music instrument. It is made of many bamboo tubes. In 2010, UNESCO officially declared angklung a World Heritage item. 

Angklung typically has two tubes and a base. Master artisans whittle bamboo into tubes of different sizes, which determine the angklung’s pitch. When a player gently shakes or taps the bamboo base, the instrument produces a single pitch. Since Angklungs only play a single note, players must work together to create melodies by shaking their angklungs at different pitches.

The Angklung’s origin dates back 400 years to West Java, Indonesia. Villagers believed the sound of bamboo could attract the attention of Déwi Sri, the goddess of rice and prosperity. Each year, the village’s best craftsmen used special black bamboo to create angklungs. During the harvest season, they held ceremonies and played Angklungs in hopes that the deity would bless them with fertile crops.

The instrument is still a staple in Indonesian culture. The government hosts Angklung performances to welcome honorable guests to Indonesia’s Presidential Palace. Angklung’s uplifting sound can be heard in classrooms around the world since it’s a great way for teachers to introduce students to Indonesian music and culture.

The Colour and the Shape

The Colour and the Shape is the second studio album by Foo Fighters, an American rock band. It was released on May 20, 1997 by Roswell and Capitol Records. "The Colour and the Shape" is the first album by the Foo Fighters with a full band. This is because their first album, "Foo Fighters", was only made by Dave Grohl. After the album became very popular, Grohl let Pat Smear, Nate Mendel, and William Goldsmith join the Foo Fighters.

The album's singles are "Monkey Wrench", "Everlong", and "My Hero". They all went into the top ten on US rock radio charts. The album went to number ten on the "Billboard" 200, and number three in the United Kingdom. It was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1998. The album has sold more than two million copies in the United States. It is the band's best selling album. It was remastered in 2007. "The Colour and the Shape" was the band's last album that was released by Capitol Records.

Dave Grohl was the only musician on the band's first album, "Foo Fighters". He made all of the music on it, except for a guitar part made by Greg Dulli. The band got very popular because of the songs "This Is A Call" and "Big Me", so Dave Grohl did a concert tour with other musicians. The musicians were bassist Nate Mendel, drummer William Goldsmith, and guitarist Pat Smear. They joined the band during the tour. Many music magazines thought that the band would make a garage rock album, but the band wanted to make normal rock music. Capitol Records, the band's record label, gave Foo Fighters a lot of control on how the album was going to sound. The songs on the album were written during sound checks before the band's concerts on the tour. Grohl would play simple riffs on his guitar, and other members jammed along to them to make songs.

Producer Gil Norton helped make the album. Grohl hired him because he liked Norton's work with the Pixies, another band. Norton wanted the band to get better. He made Nate Mendel practice playing the bass guitar. Grohl said that making the album with Norton was difficult, but "at the end of the day you listened back to what you'd done and you understood why you had to do it one million times".

In the autumn of 1996, the band started to work on the album. During this time, they rewrote some songs, and played them to see how they sounded. Norton helped the band look at the "basics" of each song, so they could play better music around it. In November 1996, the band went to Bear Creek Studio in Washington to start recording. The studio was on a farm, and the band lived in a house next to the studio. Grohl said recording at Bear Creek was "bad". He decided to get rid of most of the recordings the band made there.

In December, the band took a break. Grohl wrote new songs during the break. He recorded "Walking After You" and an acoustic version of "Everlong" by himself.

The rest of "The Colour and the Shape" was recorded at Grandmaster Recorders, a music studio in Hollywood. The band did not tell William Goldsmith, their drummer, to come with them. For four weeks, the band re-recorded music for the album. Grohl played the drums because Goldsmith was not there. By the end of recording, the only songs where Goldsmith was the drummer were "Doll" and "Up in Arms". Grohl said that Goldsmith's drumming was good, but it was not how he wanted it to sound. This is why Grohl decided to play the drums himself. Goldsmith asked if he should go to Hollywood with the band, but Grohl told him not to because he was only doing overdubs. Mendel told Goldsmith what was going on. Grohl said he still wanted Goldsmith to be in Foo Fighters, but he left the band.

After going to Hollywood, recording the album cost much more money. Capitol Records wanted the band to make the album quickly, because time in the studio cost a lot of money. The band did not get stressed by Capitol asking them to make the album in less time.

"The Colour and the Shape" started being sold on May 20, 1997. The main single from the album ("Monkey Wrench") was released a month before the album. Smear said that he wanted to leave the band because he was too tired to do a long concert tour. People that spoke for the band said that he was not leaving. A concert tour for the album started in May 1997. On September 4, at one of the concerts on the tour, Smear left the band. He gave his guitar to Franz Stahl so he could finish the concert.

In August 1997, "Everlong" was released as a single. It was the best selling single from the album. It was certified double platinum by the RIAA. In 1998, "My Hero" was also released as a single. All three singles went into the top ten on "Billboard"'s Mainstream Rock music chart. To mark ten years of the album being sold, Foo Fighters released it again on July 10, 2007. This version of the album has six extra songs: "Dear Lover", "The Colour and the Shape", and four covers.

Pollux b

Pollux b, (also known as Beta Geminorum b and HD 62509 b, formally named Thestias), is an extrasolar planet about 34 light years away in the constellation of Gemini. This planet was discovered orbiting the star Pollux in 2006 by the astronomer, Artie P. Hatzes, confirming his hypothesis originally published in 1993. The planet has twice the mass of Jupiter. It moves around its star in 1.61 years at a distance of 1.64 AU in a nearly circular orbit.

In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain extrasolar planets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Thestias for this planet. The winning name was based on that originally submitted by theSkyNet of Australia; specifically Leda, Pollux's mother in Greek and Roman mythology. At the request of the IAU, 'Thestias' (the patronym of Leda, a daughter of Thestius) was substituted. This was because 'Leda' was already attributed to an asteroid known as 38 Leda and to one of Jupiter's satellites known as Leda.

Overton window

The Overton window is a nickname for the set of opinions and ideas that it is possible for a politician to have without losing any chance of ever winning an election again. It is a reference to the ideas about politics that is generally fine to have.

Joseph Overton explained why libertarian think tanks exist by creating a chart of different political ideas that it’s possible to have with a straight line from “most government, least freedom” to “least government, most freedom” and said that the ideas that politicians can get away with supporting are in the middle of it but sometimes where that is changes. For example, Prohibition is something that people once supported while being in the mainstream but then society changed so that no politician could get away with supporting prohibition because society moved towards more freedom and less government. Overton also said that society could move in the direction of less freedom and more government. Overton said libertarian think tanks existed to move society to the point where more libertarian ideas were more mainstream and statism was seen as more radical. After Overton died, his think tank, the Mackinac Centre, started to call that idea, the Overton Window.

In 2010, Glenn Beck wrote a novel called The Overton Window based on conspiracy theories. When talking about it on Fox News, Beck said that the Overton Window meant things that politicians were willing to support and that the Overton Window changed when politicians decided that some ideas should become taboo or that some taboo ideas should become mainstream. The Mackinac Centre criticized him for saying this and said that it’s not politicians who change The Overton Window (at least it usually isn’t), it’s society that changes and the politicians change with it.

After the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States, a lot of political commentators on both the Left and the Right started talking about how the Overton Window had changed or how to change it. So Lawrence Reed wrote an essay for the Foundation for Economic Education explaining the idea of the Overton Window.

My Immortal (fan fiction)

My Immortal is a work of Harry Potter fanfiction known for being badly received.

A seventeen-year-old Goth Satanist vampire named Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven Way, (commonly misspelled or known as Ebony, Enoby, Eboby, and Tara) is in England as a student of Hogwarts and dating Draco Malfoy. Ebony is in a rock music band with Hermione Granger, whose name is now Bloody Mary Smith, Harry Potter who is known by the nickname Vampire and her friend Willow. While Ebony is the only Chosen One who can beat Voldemort (misspelled as Vlodemort or Volsemort) who wants Ebony to kill Vampire Potter.

After Ebony finds out that her boyfriend Draco Malfoy used to date Vampire Potter and is angry about it she goes to a forest where Voldemort comes to her and tells her to kill Vampire Potter. He later gives Ebony a gun and tells her “Thou must kill Vampire Potter or I will kill him anyway”.

Then Remus Lupin and Severus Snape watch Ebony in the bath while Lupin was masticating so Ebony threw her wound at them and then took out a gun and shot them “a gazillion times”. Then Snape wants to rape Ebony because he is a Christian and she is a Satanist and he hates her but he is stopped by Hagrid. Ebony then goes back in time to stop Tom Brombadil from becoming Voldemort though she calls him Satan as a nickname. Ebony and Tom Anderson also known as Satan then join a rock music band in the 1980s with Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and Lucius Malfoy. Then Morty McFlee comes with a time machine and Ebony and Satan steal it to go back to the future where Satan transforms into Voldemort.

My Immortal got an extremely negative reception with a lot of people saying that they didn’t like it or that they hated it. Some people called it the worst fan fiction ever written. Even now it’s still said to be the worst fan fiction ever made more often than any other fan fiction is. Though some people think that My Immortal was written as a parody of bad Harry Potter fan fiction and was actually trying to be bad because of it. My Immortal singer Amy Lee said that she read it and laughed “because of the nonsense”.

The author of My Immortal uses the name Tara Gillebsie but that might be a pen name. From 2008 to 2009, there was a YouTube channel by two teenagers named Tara and Raven who liked to joke about Goth subculture but when they were interviewed in 2014 said that they didn’t write it even though a lot of people thought that they did. 

In 2017, a woman named Rose Christo wrote a book called “Under the Same Stars: The Search for My Brother and the True Story of My Immortal” about being a Native American who never saw her brother again after foster care and about writing My Immortal. It later turned out that she wasn’t actually Native American and was never actually in foster care. But she still said that she was the person who wrote My Immortal even though her brother didn’t believe her.

My Immortal is a fan fiction that has fan fiction written about it but those fan fictions are usually making fun of it.

Cat (zodiac)

The Cat is the fourth animal symbol in the 12-year cycle of the Vietnamese and Gurung zodiac. It occurs during the period of the Rabbit in the Chinese zodiac. Because of this, the personality traits related with the rabbit will be related with the cat. Cats are the opposite of rats.

Myths related to the order of the Chinese zodiac often include stories of why the cat is not among the twelve. Because the mouse tricked the cat into missing the feast with the Jade Emperor, the cat was not included and did not know that the feast was happening and was not given a year, so the antipathy between cats and mice began. It is possible that turtles did not spread to China in the zodiac designation.

Another legend known as "The Great Race" says that all the animals of the zodiac are headed for the Jade Emperor. The cat and the mouse are the smartest of animals. However they are both poor swimmers and come across a river. They both trick the kind, mindless cow into helping them by leading them back to the river. As the ox reached the other side of the river, the mouse pushed the cat into the river. Then they jumped from the ox and visited the Jade Emperor, becoming the first of the zodiac. All the other animals made it to Emperor Jade, while the cat was left to drown in the river after being sabotaged by the mouse. It is said that this is also the reason cats are always hunting rats.

There have been many explanations as to why the Vietnamese, unlike all other countries that follow the Lunar calendar on the moon, have the cat instead of the Rabbit as a zodiac animal. The most common explanation is that the ancient word for Rabbit (Mao) sounds like cat (Meo).

People born within "Year of the Cat" dates, instead of "Year of the Rabbit."

It is the only zodiac sign represented by a mythical creature, rather than a real-life animal. The Year of the Dragon is associated with the Earthly Branch symbol 辰, pronounced chen.

It has been suggested by an academic researcher that the Earth Branch character may be related to scorpions; it may symbolize the star Antares.

In the Buddhist calendar used in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, the Dragon is replaced by the nāga. In the Gurung zodiac, the Dragon is replaced by the eagle.

People born within these dates can be said to be born in the "Year of the Dragon", while carrying the following elemental sign.

Snake (zodiac)

The Snake (蛇) is the sixth of the 12-year cycle of animals that appear in the Chinese zodiac. The Year of the Snake is related with the symbol of the Earth Branch 巳.

According to one legend, there is a reason for the order of the 12 animals in the 12-year cycle. The story goes that a race is held to cross a great river, and the order of animals in the cycle is based on their order at the end of the race. In this story, the Snake gives not being the best swimmer by cutting a hidden ride on the Horse's hoof, and when the Horse is about to cross the finish line, jumps, destroys the Horse, and thus replaced it with sixth place.

People born within these dates can be said to be born in the "Year of the Snake", while carrying the following elemental signs.

After around two years as a Russian prisoner of war, he returned to MTK Budapest in the 1918/19 season.

FC Nürnberg, which he led to the semi-finals of the German championship two years later, in which they lost to FC Bayern Munich. The National Socialist newspaper Der Stürmer started a campaign against the Jewish coach and Konrad left the club.

He returned to Romania to Ripensia Timisoara and then to SK Židenice in Brno. For the winter break of 1934/35 he returned to Austria in Vienna and led the club from last place in the table to the ÖFB Cup victory. In 1936 he moved to Italy, coached the US Triestina in Serie A and set the club's best result with sixth place. He had to leave the club and Italy in 1938 due to the Italian racial laws. He took over the coaching post at Olympique Lillois and reached the final of the French Cup, which was lost against Racing Paris.

Moral panic is when a category or group of people is seen as a threat to the moral values of society. The people who are seen as a threat show certain patterns of behaviour which are seen as problematic. The goal of the moral panic is to stop these problematic behaviours. In modern times, a sensationalist reporting of the press, and privately organized actions often accompany moral panics. 

In the end, a moral panic will lead to an increase in social control; the chances that values change in a normal way will decrease. 

Moral panic is different from mass hysteria. With mass hysteria, there is no social control.


Flash mob

A flash mob (or flashmob) is when people suddenly come together in a public place to do something. After they are done, they disperse again. Many times, the people coming together do not know each other. Flash mobs are often done for entertainment, satire, and art. Flash mobs may be organized via telecommunications, social media, or viral emails.

The term was first used in 2003. It is generally not used for events and performances organized for politics (such as protests), advertisments, or actions that involve public relation firms or paid professionals. If a flash mob is planned, the term smart mob is often used.

The term "flash rob" or "flash mob robberies", a reference to the way flash mobs assemble, has been used to describe many robberies and assaults done by groups of teenage youth. Bill Wasik, originator of the first flash mobs, and a number of other commentators have questioned or objected to the usage of "flash mob" to describe criminal acts. Flash mob has also been featured in some Hollywood movie series, such as "Step Up".

Delta Canis Majoris

Delta Canis Majoris is a star in the constellation of Canis Major. It is a yellow-white F-type supergiant with an apparent magnitude of +1.83.

Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has been one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.

Delta Canis Majoris is a supergiant of class F8 with a radius around 215 times that of the Sun.

Its surface temperature is 5,818 K, and it is 12 times more massive than the Sun. Its absolute magnitude is −6.87, and it is 1,600 light-years away. It is rotating at a speed of around 28 km/s, and so may take a year to rotate fully.

Only around 10 million years old, Delta Canis Majoris has stopped fusing hydrogen in its core, Its outer envelope is beginning to expand and cool, and in the next 100,000 years it will become a red supergiant as its core fuses heavier and heavier elements, Once it has an iron core, it will collapse and explode as a supernova.

If Delta Canis Majoris were as close to Earth as Sirius is, it would be as bright as a half-full moon.

Notes

Moombahton

Moombahton (, ) is a fusion genre. It mixes house music, african music and reggaeton.
It was created by American DJ and producer Dave Nada in Washington, D.C., in 2009.

Moombahton was created by Dave Nada in late 2009. It was while he was DJing his cousin's high school cut party in Washington, D.C.. He blended the house and club music which he had planned to play with the dancehall and bachata. The guests were listening to them by slowing down Afrojack's remix of Silvio Ecomo and Chuckie's "Moombah!" from 128 BPM to 108 BPM, to create the basis of the genre. Between late 2009 and early 2010, Nada worked on a five track extended play of moombahton tracks that was released in March 2010, with the support of the DJ Ayres and the DJ Tittsworth at T&A Records.

Though not referred to as moombahton, the concept of combining reggae/dancehall/reggaeton percussion with electronic elements dates back further than Dave Nada. Examples of artists which previously fused Latin and electronic dance music include Nadia Oh, El General, Masters at Work, Munchi, Luny Tunes, Jowell & Randy.

Moombahton has also been incorporated into existing styles of music. It creates derivative genres such as moombahcore. That was a genre fusing the tempo and percussion of moombahton with the distorted sounds of modern dubstep.

In January 2012, Beatport created a chart for the top moombahton songs of 2011.

Moombahton creator Nada and collaborator Matt Nordstrom as Nadastrom (who toured with Skrillex in 2011) are currently based in Los Angeles but return regularly to DC to play the "Moombahton Massive" parties they established in 2010 at U Street Music Hall.

Evaluation

Evaluation is the process of coming to a judgment about how good something is. A list of standards (a criteria) needs to be created before the judgment is made. This list defines what 'good' looks like in that situation. Whatever is being judged is then compared to this list. A judgment can then be made about how good that thing is.

Students are regularly evaluated in schools and universities to decide how good they are. Teachers may create a list of standards that a student must reach in order to pass a course. To be fair, this list must be applied consistently and equally to all students. 

In some subjects, students may write essays. An essay is a long piece of writing that includes evaluation. Therefore, the introduction of an essay usually includes a judgment about how good something is and the list of standards that the student has used to make that judgement. The remainder of the essay is spent proving that the opinion formed is logically correct. The writer of the essay may return to the criteria frequently to demonstrate that their opinion is the correct one, given the criteria they have used.

Jimmy Hogan

James "Jimmy" Hogan (16 October 1882 – 30 January 1974) was an English football player and coach. He was a notable footballer but his legacy is that he was a pioneer of the game and an innovative coach for teams and national teams across Europe.
Hogan's first signing was for Burnley F.C.. In 1905 he left and joined Fulham. Hogan helped Fulham reach the FA Cup semi-final in 1907–08 before joining Swindon Town and then Bolton Wanderers. In a pre-season tour Bolton beat Dutch club FC Dordrecht 10–0; Hogan promised to return to Dordrecht to ""teach those fellows how to play properly"".

In 1910 he signed a two-year contract at Dordrecht and improved the team in fitness and ball control. He also introduced the Combination Game. Impressed by his methods, the Royal Dutch Football Association let Hogan manage the Netherlands in a friendly match against Germany in October 1910, which they won 2–1. Hogan also briefly coached Wiener Amateur-SV in 1911 and 1912. In 1912, Hogan returned for a final season as a player at Bolton. Then he returned to Vienna to coach the Austrian national team. World War I meant that he was interned as a foreign prisoner of war. He was smuggled to the Hungarian border and went to Budapest, where he was allowed to coach at MTK Budapest between 1914 and 1918. Hogan laid the foundations for MTK's domination of Hungarian football, as they won ten domestic titles in a row between 1913-14 and 1924–25. During a brief return to England, he was regarded as a traitor for coaching foreign clubs.

At the end of the First World War he became coach of Young Boys Bern until 1920. 1924 he returned to Switzerland as coach of the Switzerland national team alongside his compatriot Teddy Duckworth and Hungarian Izidor Kürschner for the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. Switzerland reached the final but lost 3–0 against Uruguay. 

After the Olympics, Hogan coached Lausanne Sports and Dresdner SC Then he returned to MTK Budapest between 1925 and 1927.

Hogan next formed a partnership with Hugo Meisl in 1931. They were coaching the Austrian national team to success during its "Wunderteam" period. Between 1932 and 1934, Hogan managed Racing Club de Paris and Lausanne Sports once again before returning to England to manage Fulham from 1934. Hogan was sacked after only 31 games.

Hogan helped coach the Austrian national team at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Austria reached the final but were beaten 2–1 by Italy after extra time. After that he returned to England and coached Aston Villa Arriving at Villa, Hogan outlined his philosophy: ""I am a teacher and lover of constructive football with every pass, every kick, every movement an object."" He reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1937–38, but was sacked while in hospital with appendicitis just after the outbreak of World War II.

Hogan joined Brentford as coach in September 1948, before joining Celtic in the same year. The majority of the players viewed Hogan’s appointment negative. Hogan left Celtic by mutual agreement in 1950. Aston Villa asked him to return. Villa won the 1956–57 FA Cup.

Hogan retired, aged 77, in November 1959, but continued to scout for both Villa and Burnley. Hogan died in 1974 whilst living with his sister's daughter Margaret Melia on Brunshaw Avenue, Burnley.

Climate education is to be promoted in schools and the media, which is seen as a prerequisite for meaningful action. Thunberg makes an attempt to address what she sees as a false balance in reporting, exposing the manipulation of environmental statistics by "negotiating out" emissions and misleading labels such as "green" hydrogen, and making the voices of those currently most affected by the impacts of climate change from the Global South heard.

Painted turtle

The painted turtle ("Chrysemys picta") is a type of turtle that lives in North America. It lives in slow-moving fresh waters, from southern Canada to northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They prefer to live in wetlands that are covered in water for long periods of time, and that have plants growing through the water. Fossils show that the painted turtle existed 15 million years ago.

The adult painted turtle is 13–25 cm (5–10 in) long. The male is smaller than the female. The turtle's top shell is dark and smooth, without a ridge. Its skin is green to black with red, orange, or yellow stripes on its neck, legs, and tail.

The turtle eats aquatic plants, algae, and small water creatures including insects, crustaceans, and fish. Painted turtles mostly eat in the water. They can find and catch prey even when the water is very cloudy. Predators, such as rodents, canines, and snakes often eat the eggs and young turtles. The adult turtles' hard shells protect them from most predators.

Painted turtles are cold-blooded: they cannot make their own heat. They rely on heat from their surroundings, so they are active only during the day. In the morning, and after they come out of the water, they will sit in the sun for a few hours to warm up. During winter, the turtle hibernates, usually in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. The turtles mate in spring and autumn. Females dig nests on land and lay eggs between late spring and mid-summer. Hatched turtles grow until sexual maturity: 2–9 years for males, 6–16 for females.

Partula affinis

Partula affinis is a species of land snail in the genus Partula. According to the IUCN, it is It is critically endangered. The species is also known as the similar partula. 

Partula arguta

Partula arguta was a species of snail in the genus Partula known as the Huahine Tiny Partula.

Partula

Partula is a genus of land snails, constituting over 100 species of arboreal land snails native to French Polynesia and neighboring islands.

Their decline and extinction is the result of failed biological control. The giant African land snail was introduced to French Polynesia as a food source, which escaped and began destroying crops. The rosy wolfsnail was subsequently introduced to eat and eradicate the giant African land snail. It instead chose to eat the 100 species of Partula endemic to the islands, resulting in an accidental mass extinction event within French Polynesia.

Some species were successfully saved by scientists who collected the last live individuals from French Polynesia and took them into captivity for breeding. Others have been resilient enough to survive in the wild.

"Partula affinis", which survived in a valley the rosy wolfsnail never reached. It is believed to be a closely related species to "Partula otaheitana".

"Partula clara", which continues to survive in some areas.

"Partula exigua", the first species of Partula to become extinct, a predatory snail itself which ate other native snails. These prey snails' populations increased after its extinction. It was named for being the smallest Partula species.

"Partula faba", the first species of Partula to be described, which was taken into capitivity but failed to breed. The last died in 2016.

"Partula hebe", which is a successfully bred species. The last 9 snails were collected and bred, and have been reintroduced to the wild over 20 years later.

"Partula hyalina", which is an extremely resilient species. It continues to survive in the prescence of the rosy wolfsnail as well as on several islands the rosy wolfsnail was not introduced to.

"Partula otaheitana", the second Partula species to be described, after "Partula faba". Closely related to "Partula affinis".

"Partula rosea" and "Partula varia", two species native to Huahine. These two species were used by the natives to make jewelry. Both were successfully taken into captivity and released some time after.

"Partula suturalis" and "Partula taeniata", previously considered extinct but now considered extant because of taxonomic changes. Initially they were each confined to one subspecies, "P. s. suturalis" and "P. t. taeniata", both extinct, but since then other species have been demoted to subspecies under these two species, resulting in their "de-extinction".

"Partula turgida", the first known extinction due to a parasite. Was taken into the breeding program but all snails were killed by a parasite that infested the breeding chamber.

This is a complete list of the surviving species.
"P. garrettii" was misidentified as "P. tristis" for some time, and "P. navigatoria" was misidentified as "P. dentifera."

Coal liquefaction

Coal liquefaction is a process of changing coal into liquid hydrocarbons: liquid fuels and petrochemicals. This process is often known as "Coal to X" or "Carbon to X", where X can be many different hydrocarbon-based products. However, the most common process chain is "Coal to Liquid Fuels" (CTL)

Coal liquefaction is the process of converting solid coal into liquid fuel. This process has been developed as a means to utilize coal resources that are otherwise difficult to access and transport. The resulting liquid fuel, called synthetic crude oil, can be refined into a variety of fuels, including diesel, gasoline, and aviation fuel.

The process of coal liquefaction involves heating and pressurizing coal in the presence of a solvent. The solvent is used to extract the liquid components of the coal, which are then condensed and processed into synthetic crude oil. The crude oil can then be refined into various fuels, depending on the specific needs of the market.

While coal liquefaction has the potential to provide a significant source of energy, there are also significant environmental and economic concerns associated with the process. For example, the process releases significant amounts of greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change. Additionally, the process is energy-intensive and often requires large amounts of water, leading to concerns about water scarcity in certain regions. The high costs associated with coal liquefaction also make it less economically viable than traditional crude oil production.

Despite these concerns, coal liquefaction continues to be an area of research and development in the energy industry. Researchers are working to develop more efficient and environmentally sustainable methods of coal liquefaction, with the goal of reducing the environmental impact of the process and making it more economically viable.

In conclusion, coal liquefaction has the potential to provide a significant source of energy, but also has significant environmental and economic concerns. Further research and development is needed to make the process more sustainable and economically viable, and to ensure that the energy produced from coal liquefaction is used in a responsible and sustainable manner.

Specific liquefaction technologies generally fall into two categories: direct (DCL) and indirect liquefaction (ICL) processes.

Mary Sue

Mary Sue is a term used to describe a character in stories, especially fan fiction, who is almost perfect and often better than other characters. Mary Sue characters are criticized because they don't have flaws and can seem too powerful. Usually, people use this term for female characters, but there are other names for male characters like this too.

A woman named Paula Smith made up the term "Mary Sue" in 1973. She published a magazine with Star Trek fan stories, and many of the writers were women. Smith noticed that some of these writers wanted to imagine themselves in the story, so they made the main characters, like and Spock, love their own characters. In 1974, Smith wrote a funny story called "A Trekkie<nowiki>'s Tale" to make fun of this. The story was about a girl named Mary Sue who became a very important person in the "Star Trek"</nowiki> universe at a young age. Captain Kirk fell in love with her, and she saved the day but died doing it. 

After "A Trekkie<nowiki>'s Tale," people started using the term "Mary Sue" for other stories too. They would say a character was a Mary Sue if they seemed too perfect or if they felt like the author put themselves into the story. This happened in fan fiction for other things like "Star Wars"</nowiki> too.

The tempo is often slower than that of traditional electronic dance music. Often the name chill-out music is used to refer to songs demonstrative of the genre, but those names also refer to other styles of music, and downtempo encompasses a wider variety of styles than those terms alone would indicate. Because of the relaxing and often sensual or romantic feel of most downtempo music, it is a popular form of background music in 'chill out rooms' of dance parties, and many alternative cafes.

Mattathias

Matityahu son of Yochanan, also known by the Greek name Mattathias was a Jewish kohen who lived when Antiochus IV took over Judea. When the Greeks tried to assimilate the Jews they ordered him to offer a sacrifice to Zeus but Matityahu refused. Matityahu decided to lead a rebellion against Antiochus to defend Judaism but he died of old age so his sons and their followers, known as the Maccabees fought the war against the Greeks and beat them.

Antiochus IV Epiphanes

Antiochus IV also known as Antiochus Epiphanes was a ruler of the Seleucid Empire. He was known for conquering most of Egypt from the Ptolemaic dynasty, for conquering Judea and Samaria and for losing a war to the Maccabees.

Antiochus’s father Antiochus the Great ruled the Seleucid Empire and fought wars against the Roman Republic. After ending them with a treaty, the Romans took the younger Antiochus hostage to make sure that his father didn’t disturb the peace, since that was one of the rules in the treaty. After Antiochus’s father died, his older brother Seleucus IV Philopator became king so the Romans freed Antiochus and took Seleucus’s son. Someone named Heliodorus worked for the government of the Seleucid Empire so Heliodorus (minister) killed Seleucus to take over the Empire. Then Antiochus teamed up with King Eumenes II to take over and become the new king and Antiochus (probably) killed his nephew so that he could stay king.

Antiochus fought a war against Egypt and won but didn’t want to scare the Roman Republic into thinking he was dangerous so he let Ptolemy VIII continue to rule Egypt. 
Antiochus wanted to assimilate the Jews since he didn’t want them to rebel so he banned circumcision, used the law to make the Jews work on the Sabbath, put Greek idols in the Second Temple of Jerusalem, made the Chief Kohen sacrifice animals to Zeus and put a gymnasium in the Temple’s yard where the people would wrestle naked. Matityahu son of Yochanan was angry about this so he decided to lead a rebellion against Antiochus. Then Matityahu died so his son, Judah Maccabee led the revolt against Antiochus. Antiochus lost the war to the Maccabees. 

Shortly after the Maccabean Revolt, Antiochus got sick and died. 

Jewish tradition has Antiochus as the villain of the story of Hanukkah and most ancient books (including non-Jewish ones) also have him as a bad king even though there are some historians today who don’t think that he was that bad there are also some who think he actually was that bad.

Virtual particle

A virtual particle is a short-lived particle. It is similar to an ordinary particle, but cannot be directly detected. Virtual particles can suddenly appear in the vacuum and then quickly disappear. They can also be emitted by real particles and interact with other particles. In both cases their lifetime is limited by the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. They interact also with macroscopic objects and, for example, cause the attraction of two metal plates in a vacuum. This phenomenon is called the Casimir effect (predicted by Hendrik Casimir in 1948)

<poem>O land of soft, fresh breezes
And verdant trees so fair,
With the Creator's glory
Reflected ev'rywhere,
O sea of palest em'rald,
Merging to darkest blue,
Whene'er my thoughts fly Godward,
I always think of you.

Dear, verdant island, set in blue Caribbean Sea,
I'm coming, coming very soon, o beautious isle, to thee.
Although I wandered far,
My heart enshrines thee yet.
Homeland, fair Cayman Isle,
I cannot thee forget.

Away from noise of cities,
Their fret and carking care,
With moonbeams' soft caresses,
Unchecked by garish glare,
Thy fruit with rarest juices,
Abundant, rich and free,
When sweet church bells are chiming,
My fond heart yearns for thee. 

When tired of all excitement
And glam'rous worldly care,
How sweet thy shores to reach
And find a welcome there,
And when comes on the season
Of peace, goodwill to man,
'Tis then I love thee best of all,
Beloved Isle Cayman.</poem>

According to the historian Appian, Heliodorus killed Seleucus while Seleucus’s oldest son Demetrius was a hostage in Rome and Seleucus’s second son Antiochus was too young to rule as king so Heliodorus could proclaim himself regent of the Seleucid Empire. Then Seleucus’s brother Antiochus overthrew Heliodorus and had him either exiled or killed and proclaimed himself King Antiochus IV.

In 278 B.C.E, the Gauls invaded Anatolia and Antiochus I stopped them using war elephants from India and was nicknamed Antiochus Soter, meaning Antiochus the Saviour. 
In 275 B.C.E, Antiochus made his son Seleucus the viceroy of his empire. Then in 268 B.C.E, Seleucus tried to lead an uprising against his father Antiochus, so Antiochus had him killed.

Ptolemy III Euergetes was angry about this so he invaded Syria and started a war.

Seleucus appointed his brother Antiochus Hierax as viceroy of the Seleucid Empire so that he could have Antiochus Hierax rule Syria for him while he left to fight Ptolemy. Ptolemy won most of the battles but Seleucus won enough of them that in 241 B.C.E. they agreed to a treaty which said that Ptolemy ruled all the lands he conquered but that Seleucus would stay ruler of the Seleucid Empire. 

While Seleucus was off fighting the war, his brother Antiochus Hierax tried to become the new king in Asia Minor. So Seleucus started a war with Hierax to take it back. The war went on for two years and ended in a stalemate. 

After this, Parthia left the Seleucid Empire and Seleucus went to war to get it back but lost. 

After Hierax died, Seleucus’s aunt Stratonice asked him to marry her. He said no so she led a rebellion against him. Seleucus crushed the revolt and had her executed. 

In 225 B.C.E, Seleucus fell off his horse and died. His son Alexander became king and changed his name to Seleucus III Ceraunus.

Blackwall Tunnel

The Blackwall Tunnel is a pair of road tunnels under the River Thames in East London. They link the London Borough of Tower Hamlets with the Royal Borough of Greenwich. They are part of the A102 road.

For road traffic, the tunnel is one of the most important ways of getting across the Thames. It is crowded almost 24 hours a day, and a vehicle breakdown is close to being a major emergency.

The tunnel was originally a single-bore tunnel in 1897, with mainly horse-drawn traffic. It was doubled in 1967, years after this had been needed.

The northern approach is from the A12 road, and the southern approach is from the A2.

Halothane

Halothane, aka Fluothane, is a general anesthetic used to induce or maintain anesthesia. Its systematic name is 2-Bromo-2-Chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane. 

It was discovered in 1955 and approved for medical use in 1958. 

It was replaced with newer anaesthetics such as isoflurane and enflurane in the more developed countries. In some severe cases after repeated exposure, it lead to a severe liver injury. Also, the concern about hepatitis helped make the decision to not use halothane for adults in the 1980s and the 1990s for children.

Bruno Maderna

Bruno Maderna (21 April 1920 – 13 November 1973) was an Italian conductor and composer. For the final ten years of his life he lived in Germany. He eventually became a citizen of that country.

Maderna was born in Venice. At the age of four he was taught violin in Chioggia. His grandfather also recognized the child's brilliance. He was known in Italy and abroad as "Brunetto" (Italian for Little Bruno).

He continued his studies in Milan (1935), Venice (1939) and in Rome (1940). That was where he finally took his degree in composition and musicology at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. At Rome he was instructed by Alessandro Bustini, but he also took a course of instruction from Antonio Guarnieri in Siena in 1941, and he then studied composition with Gian Francesco Malipiero in Venice in 1942/43.

Carol (music)

A carol is a festive song. It is generally religious but not necessarily connected with church worship. It is also often with a dance-like or popular character.

Today the carol is represented almost by the Christmas carol, the Advent carol, and to a much lesser extent by the Easter carol, however despite their present association with religion, this has not always been the case.
The word "carol" is thought to have been derived from the French word "caroller". That was a circle dance accompanied by singers (in turn derived from the Latin "choraula"). The carol was very popular as a dance song from the 1150s to the 1350s. That was after which its use expanded as a processional song sung during festivals. That was while others were written to accompany religious mystery plays (such as the "Coventry Carol", written in 1591).

Dance-rock

Dance-rock is a dance-infused genre of rock music. It is a post-disco genre connected with pop rock and post-punk with fewer rhythm and blues influences. It originated in the early 1980s, following the decline in popularity of both punk and disco.

Industrial music

Industrial music is a music term. It describes a wide range of bands generally mixing rock with samplers and electronic instruments. 

Taking its name from a record label formed by the London band Throbbing Gristle, the roots of industrial music are firmly placed in punk rock, although the choice of instrumentation differs from the guitar/bass/drum combo of bands like the Sex Pistols.

The first wave of this music appeared in the late 1970's in the United Kingdom with bands. These are like the afore mentioned Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire and SPK. Blending electronic synthesisers, guitars and early samplers, these bands created an aggressive and abrasive music fusing elements of rock with experimental electronic music. Like their punk cousins, they enjoyed the use of shock-tactics including explicit lyrical content, graphic art and Fascist imagery. The label Industrial Records controversially used an image of a gas chamber. That was in its logo.

Across the Atlantic, similar experiments were taking place. Boyd Rice (aka NON) released several albums of noise music. That was with guitar drones and tape loops creating a cacophony of repetitive sounds. In San Francisco, performance artist Monte Cazazza began releasing albums of atonal rock. In Germany Einstürzende Neubauten were performing acts daring, mixing metal percussion, guitars and even jackhammers in elaborate stage performances. They often damaged the venues they were playing.

In the early 1980s advances in sampling technology, and the popularity of synthesised new wave music bought some industrial musicians greater exposure. As much as some new wave bands were informed by the experiments of the industrial bands, the original industrial groups also began to refine their sound. Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle experimented with dance beats, and the Cab's (as they were known by fans) album "The Crackdown" (1983) was released on Virgin Records to some success.

Into the 1980's the more experimental side of industrial music became subsumed into dance and rock music. Psychic TV, formed from the remnants of Throbbing Gristle released early albums of acid house music, like "Jack The Tab" (1988). In America, bands such as Skinny Puppy and Ministry, mixed shock-rock performances with electronic samples and heavy metal guitars and created a genre. It was often referred to as "industrial rock". Other notable artists in this genre enjoyed widespread mainstream success in the 1990's. These included but were not limited to Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson and Fear Factory.

Experimental rock

Experimental rock (or avant-rock) is a subgenre of rock music. It pushes the boundaries of common composition and performance technique or which experiments with the basic elements of the genre. Artists aim to liberate and innovate, with some of the genre's distinguishing characteristics being improvisational performances, avant-garde influences, odd instrumentation, opaque lyrics (or instrumentals), unorthodox structures and rhythms, and an underlying rejection of commercial aspirations.
There was always experimentation in rock music, but it was not until the late 1960s that new openings were created from the aesthetic intersecting with the social. In 1966, the boundaries between pop music and the avant-garde began to blur, and rock albums began to be conceived and executed as distinct, extended statements. Rock musicians (mostly unschooled) in the middle and late 1960s drew from the work of composers like John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Luciano Berio. Academic Bill Martin acknowledges: "in the case of imitative painters, what came out was almost always merely derivative, whereas in the case of rock music, the result could be quite original, because assimilation, synthesis, and imitation are integral parts of the language of rock."

Martin argued that the advancing technology of multitrack recording and mixing boards were more influential to experimental rock than electronic instruments such as the synthesizer. He allowed the Beatles and the Beach Boys to become the first crop of non-classically trained musicians to create extended and complex compositions. Drawing from the influence of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson and the Beatles' George Martin, music producers after the mid 1960s began to view the recording studio as a musical instrument used to aid the process of composition. When the Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds" (1966) was released to a four-month chart stay in the British Top 10, many British groups responded to the album by making more experimental use of recording studio techniques.

In the late 1960s, groups such as the Mothers of Invention, the Velvet Underground, the Fugs, the Beatles, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience began incorporating elements such as avant-garde music, sound collage, and poetry in their work. Author Doyle Greene identifies the Beatles, Frank Zappa, the Velvet Underground, Plastic Ono Band, Captain Beefheart, and Nico as "pioneers of avant-rock", though also noted "proto-prog" bands such as Pink Floyd and the Soft Machine as an influence. In addition, "The Quietus" Ben Graham described duos the Silver Apples and Suicide as antecedents of avant-rock.

Heartland rock

Heartland rock is a genre of rock music. It was characterized by a straightforward musical style. That was a concern with the average American life, and a conviction. Rock music had that as a social or communal purpose beyond just entertainment.

In concert heartland rock often took the form of crowd-rousing anthems, leading to comparisons with arena rock.

Heartland rock faded away as a recognized genre by the early 1990s, as rock music in general lost influence with younger audiences and as heartland's artists turned to more personal works. 
Many major heartland rock artists began their careers in the 1960s. Springsteen would be the first artist to bring heartland rock to US and international attention, and its most commercially successful exponent. After a series of critically highly regarded, but modestly selling albums with the E Street Band, he achieved his breakthrough in 1975 with "Born to Run", which presented stories of loss, betrayal, defeat and escape in the context of his native New Jersey shoreline, with songs influenced by 50s rock and roll, Bob Dylan and Phil Spector's Wall of Sound. While Springsteen struggled for three years with legal disputes, other artists in a similar vein came to the fore. These included Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Eddie Money, and fellow Jersey Shore residents Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. In 1978, Springsteen returned with "Darkness on the Edge of Town", which reached the top ten in the US and then the number one album "The River" (1980), which continued the themes of economic and personal dissolution, produced a series of hit singles.

Giorgio Moroder

Giovanni Giorgio Moroder (, born, Urtijëi, 26 April 1940) is an Italian record producer.

Moroder is often credited with pioneering synth/disco and electronic dance music.
When in Munich in the 1970s, he started his own record label called Oasis Records. It several years later became a subdivision of Casablanca Records. He worked with Donna Summer during the era of disco (including "Love to Love You Baby" and "I Feel Love") and is the founder of the former Musicland Studios in Munich. This is a recording studio used by many artists including Electric Light Orchestra, Led Zeppelin, Queen and Elton John.

In addition to producing several hits with Donna Summer, Moroder also produced a number of electronic disco hits for The Three Degrees; two albums for Sparks, a handful of songs on Bonnie Tyler's album "Bitterblue" as well as her 1985 single "Here She Comes" and a score of songs for performers including David Bowie, Irene Cara, Madleen Kane, Melissa Manchester, Blondie, Japan, and France Joli.

He came to prominence in 1969, when his recording "Looky Looky", released on Ariola Records, was awarded a gold disc in October 1970.

Aplastodiscus leucopygius

The Guinle tree frog ("Aplastodiscus leucopygius") is a frog. It lives in Brazil. People have seen it between 800 and 1600 meters above sea level.

The adult frog is about 35-45 mm long from nose to rear end. It is green in color with white marks near its rear end. It has large disks on its toes for climbing.

The male frogs climb high into the trees before they sing for the female frogs. People have seen them sitting on high branches.

Many of the places where this frog lives are in national parks, for example, Parque Estadual Nova Baden. So it is not in danger of dying out. But there are still fewer of these frogs than there were. This is because human beings change the places where they live. Human beings cut down trees and change wetlands to drier lands for wood for building or to build farms or make places for animals to eat grass.

Dersim

Dersim (; ; ) is a mountainous historical region in the Armenian Highlands, which is in Eastern Turkey today.

The region included all parts of Tunceli Province (Çemişgezek, Hozat, Pertek, Tunceli, Ovacık, Pülümür, Nazımiye, Pertek) Tercan, Erzincan, Kemah and Kemaliye in Erzincan Province, Keban in Elâzığ Province, Kiğı in Bingöl Province and Arapkir in Malatya Province.

This region was known as Ishuwa in the 2000s BC. As a result of the struggle of the Ishuva Kingdom, which was established by the Hurrians in the region, with the Hittites, this place passed under the rule of the Hittites towards the 1600s BC. Then it came under the domination of the Urartians and formed the westernmost part of the country of Urartu. After that, it was ruled by Medes and the Persian Achaemenid Empire, next it passed into the hands of the Alexander the Great, king of Macedon. During the reign of Tigranes the Great, the king of Armenia of the Artaxiad dynasty, Dersim was annexed to the kingdom of Armenia, even after the fall of the Artaxiad dynasty, Dersim remained loyal to them and did not submit to the Romans.

After the acceptance of Christianity as the official religion in Armenia, as in many territories subject to Armenia, Dersim, the people resisted the influence of the new religion and adhered to their old religious traditions. After the Byzantine Empire occupied the western parts of Armenian state, they deported as many of the Dersimites as they could capture to Thrace and made these refugees serve as soldiers against the Bulgarian invasion. Despite all Byzantine "tricks", the people of Dersim were able to prevent the establishment of Byzantine influence in their neighbourhood. Also the Seljuks defeated Byzantine Empire in 1093 but the people of Dersim did not submit to the Seljuks. At the time of the establishment of the Safavid Empire, Shi'ism, the official sect of the Safavid Empire, had been able to spread to Dersim in a favourable manner. The Kurds of Dersim showed favour towards Shāh Ismā'īl I and agreed to cede the fortress of Kemah to Ismā'īl as a military base to facilitate the military movements of the Safavids, on condition that their sovereignty and independence would be respected by Ismā'īl.

Although the Ottoman presence began to be felt in the region after Mehmed II the Conqueror defeated the Aq Qoyunlu in 1473, its incorporation into the Ottoman lands took place after the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 during the reign of Selim the Grim. However, the harsh and rugged geographical structure of this place caused it to be in the hands of local administrators from time to time, away from state control. They displayed a rebellious situation during the weak periods of the central administrations. The southwestern parts was ruled by the Emirate of Çemişgezek, a hereditary and autonomous Kurdish emirate that existed from the 13th century until 1663, centred on Çemişgezek, which included Mazgirt, Pertek and Sağman. The emirate was inhabited by both Muslims and non-Muslims, and also had a significant Kurdish Alevi population, which flourished and expanded thanks to the self-government secured under Ottoman rule despite Ottoman hostility towards the minority.

In 1848, the Dersim Sanjak was formed within the Erzurum Vilayet. In 1880, the Dersim or Hozat "vilayet" was formed with Hozat as its center, although by 1888 it was made a sanjak/mutasarrifate of the Mamuret-ul-Aziz "vilayet" (now Elazığ). Even in 1895 between 1897, many Armenian "fedayis" took refuge in Dersim and benefited from the "baht" (of asylum) of the Dersimites and were able to protect themselves against the bathtubs of the Ottoman administration. Various rebellions took place in the region in the 1877, 1885, 1892, 1907, 1911, 1914 and 1916.

With the abolition of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey became the owner of the region. In 1937, an Alevi Kurdish broke out in the region and was suppressed with the deaths of 30,000 Kurds. Following the Tunceli Law 1935, which demanded a more powerful government in the region, the Fourth Inspectorate-General ("Umumi Müfettişlik," UM) was created in January 1936. The fourth UM span over the provinces of Elazığ, Erzincan, Bingöl and Tunceli, and was governed by a Governor Commander. Most of the employees in the municipality were to be filled with military personnel and the Governor-Commander had the authority to evacuate whole villages and resettle them in other parts. Also the juridical guarantees did not comply with the law in the other parts in Turkey. The trials were at most 15 days long and sentences could not be appealed. For a release, the Governor Commander had to give his consent. The application of the death penalty was under the authority of the Governor-Commander, while normally it would be the authority of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey to approve such a punishment. In 1946 the Tunceli Law was abolished and the state of emergency removed but the authority of the fourth UM was transferred to the military. The Inspectorates-General was dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.

Tunceli's (Dersim) language distribution is 69.5% Kurdish and Zazaki, 29.8% Turkish and 0.74% Armenian in 1927, also according to Savaş Sertel, Zazas are majority people and Zazaki were more common than Kurdish. However, Ahmet Kerim Gültekin defined the province as predominantly Kurdish Alevi. Kurmanji Kurdish is the main dialect around Pertek, while Zazaki is spoken in Hozat, Pülümür, Ovacık and Nazımiye. Both Kurmanji and Zaza is spoken in Tunceli town and Mazgirt. The Dimli (or Zaza) people of Dersim are the descendants of the Deylamites who migrated from the highlands of Gilan region of Iran in the 10th–12th century. The districts of Mazgirt, Nazımiye and Çemişgezek had a large Armenian population during the Ottoman period. A large part of this population must have been deported out of Anatolia with the deportation order of 1915. It is likely that the remaining population migrated to Western Anatolia. The town and district of Çemişgezek is both populated by Turks and Kurds.

The Kurdish and Zaza people of the region are divided into tribes. Of the 20 tribes in Hozat, 17 are Zazaki and 3 are Kurmanji; of the 8 tribes in Çemişgezek, 6 are Zazaki and 2 are Kurmanji; of the 17 tribes in Ovacık, 15 are Zazaki and 2 are Kurmanji; of the 13 tribes in Pülümür, 12 are Zazaki and 1 is Kurmanji; of the 14 tribes in Nazımiye 11 are Zazaki and 3 are Kurmanji; 16 of the 30 tribes in Mazgirt speak Kurmanji and 14 speak Zazaki; while all of the 8 tribes in Pertek speak Kurmanji. The Hozat included present-day central district.

According to Nuri Dersimi, it is noteworthy that six centuries before Christ, Greek historians and geographers called the Dersim region Daranis, and in the Bisltun inscriptions of Darius the Great, this region is called "Zuza", and the term "Zuza" is similar to the word Zaza, which is the "Kurdish dialect" spoken in Dersim and its region. According to another thesis, estimated that the name Dersim ("Der-sîm" "silver gate" in Persian) was given to the region, which frequently changed hands between the Sasanid and Byzantine Empires during the Byzantine period.

Krautrock

Krautrock is rock and electronic music. It was born in Germany in the late 1960s. The term was popularized in the English-speaking press. Later, German media began to use it as a term for all German rock bands from the late 1960s and 1970s. That was while abroad the term specifically referred to more experimental artists who often but not always used synthesizers and other electronic instruments.

Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock and roll influences of British and American rock music until that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and New Age music.
Key artists associated with the tag include Can, Amon Düül II, Ash Ra Tempel, Faust, Popol Vuh, Cluster, Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Neu!, and Kraftwerk.
The word "krautrock" was applied to the experimental German rock movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s by the British music press, and was retained by its practitioners. The term "krautrock" was originally a humorous one coined by the UK music press (such as "New Musical Express" and "Melody Maker"), where "krautrock" found an early and enthusiastic underground following. The term comes from the ethnic slur "kraut". Its use by the music press was inspired by a track from Amon Düül's "Psychedelic Underground" titled "Mama Düül und Ihre Sauerkrautband Spielt Auf" ('Mama Düül and her Sauerkrautband Strike Up'). As is often the case with musical genre labels, not many of the bands wanted to see themselves pigeon-holed. They tended to eschew the term. The term is also a problematic category because of the differences, from one artist to another so labelled.

Musicologist Julian Cope, in his book "Krautrocksampler", expressed in words that "Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon," based on the way the music was received in the United Kingdom instead of on the actual West German music scene out of which it became bigger. 

For example, while one of the main groups originally tagged as krautrock, Faust, recorded a seminal 12-minute track they titled "Krautrock". They later distanced themselves from the term, expressing in words that: "When the English people started talking about Krautrock, we thought they were just taking the piss... and when you hear the so-called 'Krautrock renaissance,' it makes me think everything we did was for nothing."

The dynasty was founded in Xi'an on 8 February 1644, the first day of the lunar year. The founder was Li Zicheng, the leader of a large peasant rebellion. He proclaimed himself "emperor" (皇帝) instead of the title "king" (王) before founding the dynasty.

Vacuum flask

A vacuum flask is a special container that is designed in such a way that heat cannot easily enter or exit. That way, hot drinks are kept hot longer, and cold food is kept cold. The flask is made of two containers which are separated. Between the containers there is almost no air, so heat does not pass easily.the flask is also know as dewar flask after it's inventor.

Sir James Dewar invented the flask in 1892. It consists of two flasks, placed one within the other and joined at the neck. The gap between the two flasks is partially evacuated of air, creating a near-vacuum. This significantly reduces heat transfer by conduction or convection. When used to hold cold liquids, this also eliminates most condensation on the outside of the flask.

In the household, vacuum flasks are used to keep beverages hot or cold for longer periods of time, and for keeping cooked food hot. They are also used for thermal cooking. Vacuum flasks are also used for many purposes in industry.

Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji

Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji is a group of woodblock prints by Hokusai, a Japanese artist. The prints show Mount Fuji as seen from many different places. The prints were very successful, and Hokusai made ten more after the first thirty-six. The prints were made in the 1830s.

"The Great Wave off Kanagawa", one of Hokusai's most popular prints, is a part of the series. "Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji" has been called Hokusai's "colour-print masterpiece".

Hokusai started making each print by drawing it on paper. It was glued onto a wood block, to help carve the drawing into the wood. The block was then covered with colored ink, and put onto paper to make the print. For each color on a print, Hokusai had to make a different block.

The first prints in the series were made with shades of blue ink. After the series was popular, versions of each print with many colors were made. Over one hundred prints were planned, but only forty-six were made.

Hokusai later made a book named "One-Hundred Views of Mount Fuji". It was published around 1835. It had drawings of one-hundred different views of Mount Fuji in it.

Theory Dasbien

The Theory Dasbien or Das Bien (in english Give Good) is a theoretical concept linked to the paradigm of love, and based on the book "Das Bien" by psychologist Andy Figueroa, published on May 16, 2010. It arose from humanistic psychology and the popular perspective on love. 

In psychology, it is an anti-premise of the concept of love related to emotions and feelings. It affirms that loving is something good and has healthy repercussions in human life, in addition, it broadens the concept of love to different subjects such as a mother, child, pet, parent, self or any other being. Love remains the same, but the addressee changes. 

Most of the theory is normative and practical. The Das Bien theory is linked to the concept or paradigm of love, conceived as a universal feeling by different organisms of society. However, it arises as an antithesis to the worldly concept of love, explaining through contemporary psychology that to love is to give something good, from the perspective of the recipient. It is good for the one who receives the feeling of love, creating "the expression of healthy love".

Also, from a philosophical point of view, love is not about the "I", but about the inner and outer world of the other. This type of love is born from the learning of past experiences according to the Decision Theory.

The theory suggests that love is giving, a verb with notorious particularities and that it is related to the premise: "to give something good, according to the other". It is not a sensation or feeling, nor is it a desire and taste, choice, much less is it giving everything. 


The Das Bien theory conceives that the process of love has three components encompassed in the "Triangle of Loving". This is a model similar to the "Triangle of Fire" which describes three actions: fuel, combustion, activation energy. From the logic of fire, the three components of the act of love are created.
