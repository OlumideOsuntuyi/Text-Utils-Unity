About 30% of homes in the United Kingdom are owned outright by the people who live in them. About 40% are owned by people with a mortgage. About 18% are social housing of some kind. About 12% are privately rented from private landlords.

There were about 24.9 million dwellings in England in 2021

In July 2023 Rishi Sunak announced plans to build homes in city centres and reduce planning restrictions so that a million homes would be built before the next General Election.

In 2020 there were about 2.6 million dwellings in Scotland. About 58% were owner-occupied. 4% were empty or second homes. 15% were private rented or rent free. 23% were social rented.

In 2021:


There has long been resentment of second home owners in Wales, and this is partly because of the effect on prices and partly about protecting the Welsh language. About two hundred holiday homes were burned down in the 1980s and 90s. The Welsh government has altered the planning, property and taxation rules to discourage second homes. 

There were 822,083 homes in 2022. 45% were owned outright, and 28% with a mortgage. 13% of properties were privately rented and 4% were rented from housing associations. 9% were rented from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.

In 2023, the average price for a home was about £286,500. This was one of the highest prices in Europe. In 1983 it took an average couple three years to save for a deposit. In 2023 it took nine, or 15 in London. 54% got money from their parents. People whose parents did not own their home were much less likely to be able to buy. 

The number of households in the private rented sector in the UK went up from 2.8 million in 2007 to 4.5 million in 2017. Most of these are people under 40. In 2023 241,000 homes were available for renting, 35% less than in June 2019. Rents went up by 23% in the same time. About 40% of renters had difficulty paying their rent in 2023. On average, renters spent 21% of their disposable income on rent. Most of the landlords have buy-to-let mortgages. Rising interest rates cause them problems. About 100,000 buy-to-let properties were sold in 2022.

Such games have a long history. In the 5th century BC, Greek physician Hippocrates of Kos recommended the game. It used stone balls at the time. Julius Pollux, a Greek scholar who lived in the 2nd century, described a game where bowls were thrown at a brick. Boule Lyonnaise, and boccia (soft pétanque) go back to this game. 

During the Middle Ages, the game was forbidden at various times. In the 17th century, some people wanted to promote games such as battledore and shuttlecock, and argued against boules which, at the time, was more popular.

Genital piercing

Genital piercing is a type of body piercing. People get small holes made in their skin to attach jewelry. Genital piercing is piercing done on the sex organs. Piercings near the sex organs are often also called genital piercings. The word "piercing" can be a noun that means the small holes in the skin, or it can be a noun that means the jewelry in the holes. Piercing can also be a verb meaning making a hole that goes through the skin. Usually this is done with a needle. Sometimes a tool for piercing that uses a thick needle is called a punch. In the 21st century, genital piercings are common.

Genital piercing has a long history. It was done in some traditional (pre-modern) people. Sometimes it was a "rite of passage," meaning something done when a child enters puberty, or at some time during puberty, to show that the young person is, or will soon be, an adult. In modern times, people who got genital piercings in the 1960s and 1970s were often in the gay subculture. Before the 1980s, genital piercings were usually in people who wanted to be different from the main popular culture. Groups that are very different from the popular culture are called counterculture movements. By the 1980s and 1990s, genital piercing became more common in the general population. 

Just like nipple piercings, genital piercings became more and more popular and part of mainstream culture in the second decade of the 21st century. Many famous people such as Christina Aguilera, Fantasia Barrino, Pete Doherty, Janet Jackson, Lenny Kravitz, Katarina Waters, and Pete Wentz, say that they had or planned to have genital piercings. Genital piercings are popular, especially among the college-aged, young adult, population.

Most countries (or states) say children and younger teenagers can't get genital piercings. Some countries say younger teenagers can get them if their parents say it is okay. Because businesses that do piercings are usually not allowed to do piercings on teenagers (under 18 or under 16, depending on the laws), some teenagers do piercings on their own bodies or get a friend to help. This can cause health problems. They can get bad infections if they do not use a very clean needle to make the holes.

People get genital piercings to look more beautiful, in pictures or in real life. That is the same reason people get their ears pierced. People think piercings will make other people to look at their sex organs. Piercings can be like saying, "Hey, it's okay to look!" 

Some types of genital piercing are supposed to increase sexual pleasure. Some piercings make sex more enjoyable mainly for the person with the piercings. Other piercings make sex more enjoyable for the person's sexual partner. (This is talked about later in this article.)

Some people get genital piercings to show their personal style. That is similar to people wearing clothes they like or getting their hair cut or colored in a particular style. Survivors of sexual abuse or assault sometimes get genital piercings as an act of reclamation. They felt their sexuality was taken away from them. Getting a piercing may help them feel they have reclaimed or taken back control of their genitals.

Some body piercings near the genitals are for males or females. Piercings in the mons pubis (pubic mound) are very common. However, a pubic mound piercing is not good for a person with very tight skin and very little fat in the pubic mound. The body would reject the piercing. After a while, the jewelry would come out. Another way of saying this is that the piercing would grow out. Piercings in the perineum can be done on males or females, but are not common. They can become infected because they are near the anus. They can be uncomfortable when riding a bicycle or motorcycle. 

Common genital piercings that women get are through the hood of the clitoris, through the labia majora, and through the labia minora.

The clitoral hood is a thin piece of skin that covers most of the shaft and sometimes the end (the glans) of the clitoris. A clitoral hood piercing goes through this thin piece of skin. A clitoral hood piercing is done to make the women look more beautiful, and also to increase sexual pleasure during masturbation, foreplay and sexual intercourse. 

There are two main types of clitoral hood piercing: the vertical (straight up and down) clitoral hood (VCH) piercing and the horizontal (sideways) clitoral hood (HCH) piercing. As the names indicate, the difference is in the direction of the piercing through the skin above the clitoris. Neither of these piercings penetrates the clitoris itself, although they are sometimes called "clit" piercings. Piercings that go through the clitoris itself are dangerous. There is a chance that the piercing will cause nerve damage to the clitoris. That could cause the woman to not feel anything in her clitoris. That would be very sad for the woman since the the only known purpose for the clitoris is to provide sexual pleasure. There is also a chance it could cause pain that does not go away. Piercings that go through the clitoris itself are very uncommon. A deep hood piercing is a variation of the clitoral hood piercing that passes deeper through the clitoral hood. A deep hood piercing does not go through the clitoris itself. 

One study from the University of South Alabama said that women with vertical clitoral hood piercings have more sexual desire and more sexual arousal and have sex more often than women without these piercings. During sex when the partners are facing each other, the partner's body (the pubic area, in particular) presses against the jewelry in the clitoral hood piercing, and the jewelry presses on the shaft of the clitoris and on the glans of the clitoris. The pressure and movement on the shaft and the glans of the clitoris feels very good for most women. (For some women, it does not feel good to touch the glans of the clitoris directly. The glans is too sensitive. It would feel like touching your eye. Those women might not like having a piercing near the clitoris. Those women could try using a sexual lubricant. A sexual lubricant is a slippery liquid. It can be bought at drug stores.)

A clitoral hood piercing is not always possible. It depends on the shape and size of the clitoral hood and on the shape and size of the pubic mound. A vertical clitoral hood piercing cannot be done on a very short clitoral hood. This piercing requires a clitoral hood length of 1cm or more. Excessive pressure due to fat or sagging in the pubic mound area is another reason a vertical clitoral hood piercing would not be a good idea. A horizontal clitoral hood piercing might be an alternative for some, however horizontal clitoral hood piercing is only suitable for women who have enough skin above the clitoris and whose clitoral hood is not completely covered by the outer labia. The shape and symmetry of the clitoral hood are also important to keep the piercing from rotating or pinching. If a woman's body is unsuitable for a clitoral hood piercing, a pubic piercing for a male sexual partner can sometimes provide the desired clitoral stimulation during sexual intercourse. As an alternative to either partner obtaining a piercing, a male partner can wear a removable sex toy device at the base of the penis that incorporates a clitoral stimulator or vibrator. Likewise, various clitoral vibrators and suction devices are available to enhance lesbian genital-to-genital contact.

A Christina piercing, also known as a Venus piercing, is done where the outer labia meet at the top. One end of the piercing is on the pubic mound. The other end is in the "slit" (the opening) between the labia. The Christina piercing is not a good idea on some women. It has a high rejection rate, meaning the piercing (the hole) and jewelry do not stay in the body. This piercing should not be done on women who have skin that is very tight. If the flesh above the clitoris where the outer labia meet can be pinched, a Christina piercing may be successful. Women get this piercing to make their body look more beautiful. It usually does not make sex more enjoyable. Some women say it is uncomfortable when touched or pressed.

The labia are the inner and outer lips that surround the opening to the vagina. They are part of the vulva. Piercings to the inner labia are common. Rings are the jewelry most often used. Labia piercings are mostly for decoration, but may also add pleasurable feelings during various sex acts. They are among the simpler and more common genital piercings for females, and are often done in symmetrical pairs (one on each side of the vaginal opening.)

There are many places and style of piercings men can get. 

The glans is the end of the penis. The piercing can go through the urethra. Men get piercings there because they think it makes their penis look more beautiful or interesting. A piercing through the glans can also increase sexual pleasure for the man whose penis is pierced and for his sexual partner. A piercing through the urethra is called a Prince Albert piercing. Sometimes it can cause problems urinating (peeing.)

The Corona of glans penis is the edge of the glans. A piercing that goes through the coronal rim of the glans is called a dydoe piercing. During vaginal intercourse, the piercing usually adds extra stimulation for the partner. When several dydoe piercings are placed around the head of the penis, it is called a king's crown. 

The foreskin is a thin piece of skin that covers the glans of the penis. If the man's foreskin has not been removed, he can get a piercing through the foreskin. This is an easy piercing to do. It is done for the same reasons as piercings of the glans. It can make the penis look more beautiful or interesting. It can increase sexual pleasure for both partners.

The frenulum connects the foreskin to the shaft of the penis. This is an easy piercing to do. The reasons are the same as with the other piercings above. The name of the piercing is often shortened to a frenum piercing. If there are several piercings, the name is a frenum ladder or a Jacob's Ladder. (That name comes from a dream Jacob in the bible had of a ladder going to heaven.) 

The shaft is the main part of the penis outside the body up to the glans. Piercings can go through the skin on the shaft. The skin on the penis is very thin. That makes it easy to pierce, but the jewelry might come out some day since the skin is very thin. If there are several piercings, it can be called a ladder.

The scrotum is the sack or bag that contains the testicles. Piercings on the scrotum are easy to do. They are common. They just go through the loose skin. This type of piercing is also called a Hafada piercing. A piercing that goes all the way through the scrotum is not common because it is dangerous. Common piercings on the scrotum are a ring or rings on the side of the scrotum, or barbells (straight jewelry pieces) or rings. Piercings on the scrotal raphe or "seam" of the scrotum are common. The main reason to get piercings on the scrotum is to make the scrotum look more beautiful or interesting. They don't usually increase sexual pleasure much, so that is not a reason why people get piercings on the scrotum. If there are several repeated piercings, it can be called a ladder.

There are different types of body piercing jewelry. Barbells, curved barbells (also called banana bars), J-bars (barbells shaped like the letter J), captive bead rings (also called ball capture rings or BCRs) are common. Silver jewelry should be avoided. Sometimes the beads of a barbell are decorative, as is common in navel piercings.
Sometimes gemstones or glass that looks like diamonds are used.

The time to fully heal a genital piercing varies, depending on piercing site and individual characteristics: it can range from a week up to six months. Until fully healed, preparations should be made against possible causes of infection, such as proper cleaning on a daily basis. People with fresh piercings should abstain from sexual activity for the first few days and also then should use physical protection barriers such as condoms until the piercing is fully healed.

Galvanized iron

Galvanized iron means the iron is covered by a metal that does not rust, or which only rusts slowly. Iron is usually covered with zinc. The iron cannot rust because the zinc covering protects it.

The zinc resists corrosion even when scraped. After the paint is scratched, metal corrodes. When the zinc has completely corroded, the iron begins to do the same.

There are two ways of galvanising: 

Hot dip galvanising: the item is put in a vat of liquid zinc. This gives a longer-lasting, thicker covering. Some people might not appreciate it as much, though, because it does not have a bright, clean surface.

Also possible is electro-galvanizing. This is the process of electroplating zinc onto a surface. Although it is thinner and more sparkly, it does not last as long.

Stanbridge Earls School

Stanbridge Earls School in Hampshire has a vast history. 

The main house in Audley Stanbridge Earls is a Grade II* listed building. Its history dates back to Saxon royalty, with links to King Alfred the Great and the founder of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale.

From 1066, numerous families went on to own the estate. However, under ownership by John Fifield in the late 18th century, it fell into decay.

At the end of the 18th century, Florence Nightingale's father, William Nightingale, bought Stanbridge Earls. While being passed down through relatives, new wings were added to the property and it began to transform into the Tudor manor house it is today.

The name "Stanbridge" is of Saxon origin and derived from a bridge crossing on the River Test. There are claims for Stanbridge as the location of the burial in c.857 of King Æthelwulf based on antiquarian accounts from 16th to 18th centuries.

At the time of the Norman conquest an identifiable land holding was already in existence, recorded in the Domesday survey as an unnamed manor that was part of the estates held by Sir Ralph de Mortimer.

From 1942, along with Roke Manor to the south, Stanbridge Earls was used as a rest and recuperation home for USAF personnel. It was photographed in 1943, with images of the gardens, including the Burmese temple.

Preimplantation genetic testing

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a way of checking embryo cells before they are placed, or implanted, inside a mother's body. It is also named preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). The good thing about PGD is that it can let the parents not choose the embryo which will develop into a child with a certain disease. This way, the parents do not have to choose to stop the pregnancy if the baby has the disease. To do preimplantation testing, doctors take the mother's eggs from her body. Then, the embryo is tested, and put back in the mother after 5 or 6 days of growing.

The first preimplantation testing was done by choosing a female embryo, because the disease was only possible if there was one X chromosome, such as in male embryos.

It can also test to see if the embryo has a different number of chromosomes than normal. This is called preimplantation genetic testing for "aneuploidy", or PGT-A. The other types of preimplantation genetic testing are for gene (monogenic) disorders (PGT-M), for many gene (polygenic) disorders (PGT-P), for seeing if large parts of the chromosomes are improperly put together (PGT-SR).

Sometimes, tests can also be done on the mother's eggs or the father's sperm before they meet to make a baby. These can also be part of PGD.

How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb

Interscope Records released it on 23 November 2004 in the United States. The album is similar to "All That You Can't Leave Behind" (2000), the band's tenth album.

Corona of glans penis

The corona of glans penis or penis crown is the rounded edge or flare that forms at the base of the glans (which is the end of the penis) in human males. The glans, and therefore the corona, are exposed (seen) when the foreskin (or prepuce) of the penis is pulled back (retracted.) The appearance of the glans penis is often slightly different between an uncircumcised and a circumcised male. A circumcised male has had the foreskin shortened or removed. This is a very common procedure (medical operation) done in many cultures or countries. It is often done shortly after birth. If the foreskin is completely removed, the corona will always be exposed. If the foreskin is just shortened, the corona may still be covered by the foreskin when it is in the forward (unretracted) position. 

The corona overhangs a mucosal surface, called the neck of the penis, which separates the shaft (the long middle part of the penis) and the glans. The edge of the corona has a great number of nerve endings and is a very sexually sensitive part of the glans.

During the embryonic development of the male fetus, a thickening on the epidermis (outer layer of skin) appears around the base of the developing glans. The thickening layer of skin separates from the glans, creating the foreskin.

The corona and the neck are highly vascularized areas of the penis. The axial and dorsal penile arteries merge together at the neck before entering the glans.

The corona and the neck are highly vascularized areas of the penis, meaning they have many blood vessels providing a good blood supply. 

The circumference (edge) and the underside of the corona are densely innervated by several types of nerve endings. The corona is a highly erogenous (easily sexually stimulated) part of the penis. The area is very sensitive to stimulation and an area of intense sexual pleasure.

In some males, small skin-colored bumps, known as pearly penile papules, may appear at the circumference of the corona. Their appearance may vary from being hardly noticeable in some men to more prominent and well-defined in others. The papules are painless, harmless and non sexually transmitted. They usually appear in late puberty and are thought to disappear with age.[13] Even though they do not require treatment, they can easily be removed, especially for aesthetic purposes.[14]

Heritability of autism

The heritability of autism is how much of people getting autism is because of their genes. It is also the way that the genes create autism. Autism is mostly genetic, and it has a heritability of 80% to 90%. Heritability is how much genes can explain who gets autism and who doesn't. The environment can still be very important even with a large heritability. Heritability is estimated by studying twins. Since both twins have autism most of the time, it is more genetic. It is caused by many different genes working together, not just one.

Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale

The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (shortly called WAIS) is a kind of test that measures how smart adults are. It was made by David Wechsler. The test checks different parts of being smart, like understanding words, solving problems, and remembering things. The test has been changed many times to make it better. The last change was the fourth one, so it is now called WAIS-IV.

The WAIS is one of the most commonly used tests to check how smart someone is. It can be used in many places, like schools, hospitals, and courts. The test helps people understand how a person thinks and can help them get the right help if they need it.

The test takes about 60 to 90 minutes to complete. The person who takes the test answers questions and solves puzzles. Their score tells how smart they are compared to other people of the same age.

Raven's Progressive Matrices

Raven's Progressive Matrices is a test that measures a person's ability to solve problems and think logically. It was created by a man named John C. Raven. This test is different from others because it does not depend on language or cultural knowledge. It uses images and patterns, not words.

The test is made up of many different pictures, arranged in a grid or "matrix." Each picture has a pattern, but one piece of the pattern is missing. The person taking the test needs to find the missing piece from a list of options. The test gets harder as it goes on. It starts with simple pictures and patterns, and then becomes more complex. This is why it is called "progressive". The test can show if a person is good at seeing patterns and relationships between things. This test can be used with both children and adults. It is helpful because it does not require any reading or writing skills, so it can be used with people from many different backgrounds and education levels.

Factor analysis

Factor analysis is a way to look at many pieces of information and find groups among them. These groups are called "factors". 

Factor analysis is used to see if many things are related or similar. For example, if a person is asked many questions, factor analysis could be used to see if some of the answers are similar. 

This method is used in many fields. For example, in psychology, it is used to find out if certain behaviors or feelings are related. In business, it can be used to see if different products are liked by the same group of people.

Factor analysis makes it easier to understand large amounts of data. It can help to show important patterns and relationships in the data. It can also help to simplify complex information.

Charles Spearman

Charles Spearman was a psychologist. He was born in London, England on September 10, 1863. He died on September 17, 1945. He is known for his work in understanding how people are smart. He also made statistical tests that people still use. One of these is called "Spearman's rank correlation coefficient." 

He made a method named "factor analysis". This method helps find patterns in a lot of complex information. 

He discovered that if someone is good at one mental task, they are probably good at other mental tasks too. He named this "general intelligence" or "g factor".

Additive genetics

Additive genetics are genes that add together to create an effect on a trait. It happens if multiple genes affect the same trait or phenotype. This can be genes for height or genes for if someone gets a disease. For example, one gene might cause someone to be a millimeter taller. A different gene might cause someone to be two millimeters taller. Since the effect of the genes add together, having both of these genes would result in being three (one plus two) millimeters taller.

When genes do not add together, it is called dominance or epistasis, which can be important for Menedelian (single-gene) diseases. Sometimes, even when there are some dominant genes, additive genetics can be more important.

Complex traits are usually determined by many genes which add together. For example, dominance is not important compared to additive genetics for some traits, including height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate.

Indirect genetic effects

Indirect genetic effects happen when a person is affected by another person's genes. This is different from "direct" genetic effects, when one's own genes have an effect. This can be done by friends or family members. It is called "genetic nurture" if the genes that affect the person are present in the person's parents. Genetic nurture only involves the genes that aren't passed down to the child.

A mother or father might have genes that cause them to feel sad or depressed. This might change the way they treat their child. The way they treat their child could make the child feel sad or depressed. In this way, the genes of the mother or father affected the child, even though the child did not have the genes for being depressed.

Some research says that certain behaviors or diseases are caused by the environment because they see a correlation, or a relationship, between an environment and the behavior or disease. However, it could be caused by indirect genetic effects instead of by the environment. Understanding this can help us realize that many disorders, such as dyslexia, are not the fault of the mother and father. Sometimes, changes are made to a child's life to prevent a disorder. These changes are called interventions. Understanding indirect genetic effects could help scientists know which interventions will not work.

Scientists are able to study indirect genetic effects on a child, even if those effects come from the child's parents. This can be difficult because the parents also pass down genes to the child. Scientists only look at genes that are not passed down. If they did not do this, they might be measuring the direct effect of the gene. They do this by getting information on many of the genes in the mother, father, and child, to see which ones are passed down. To study indirect genetic effects, scientists only look at the genes that were not passed down.

These indirect genetic effects are important for educational success, psychological wellbeing, and physical health. However, direct genetic effects are still important. For example, the direct effect of genes is twice as important as the indirect effect of genes for determining someone's level of education. Most of genetic nurture is often because genes that change a parent's own education and socioeconomic status. These changes in education and socioeconomic status change the child's development.

Ketoacidosis

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is caused by untreated high blood glucose (hyperrglycemia). If does not get treated, it can develop into a life threatening sickness. The body breaks down fat at a high rate. It is caused by a lack of insulin and a high number of ketones which causes blood to become acidic. This sickness is an emergency that can lead to coma or death.

Symptoms of ketoacidosis include:

Those who have type 2 diabetes can also get sick with ketoacidosis. DKA can happen with high blood sugar, when medicine is stopped, because of a bad sickness or infection.

Rhacophorus translineatus

The Medog flying frog, cross-barred tree frog, translnate tree frog ("Rhacophorus translineatus") is a frog. It lives in India and China.

Rhacophorus catamitus

Rhacophorus catamitus is a frog. It lives in Indonesia in Sumatra. It lives in the forest in the Bukit Barisan mountains. Scientists have seen it between 1068 and 1680 meters above sea level.

Raorchestes

Raorchestes is a genus of frogs. This genus is in the subfamily Rhacophorinae. These frogs live in the mountains in China and other parts of Asia. Scientists say "Raorchestes" is a sister taxon of "Pseudophilautus". Scientists started using this genus in 2010. Before that, the frogs now in "Raorchestes" had been in "Ixalus" (which scientists do not use now), "Philautus", and "Pseudophilautus".

The genus is named for C. R. Narayan Rao. He worked on Indian batrachology. The part of the name, "orchestes", is from the name of an older genus, "Orchestes" Tschudi 1838. Scientists have gone to the Western Ghat Mountains in India to look for these frogs, and they say there are even more species than people think. Scientists believe that the fact that groups of Western Ghat mountains are far from each other caused these frogs to become so many different species.

Most frogs in "Raorchestes" move around at night instead of during the day. They are small frogs. The adult frog is from nose to rear end. They do not have vomerine teeth in their jaws. Male frogs have a large vocal sac that they use to sing for female frogs. The skin of the vocal sack is transparent—the human eye can see through it. All species in "Raorchestes" grow from frogs into eggs in direct development: they do not swim as tadpoles. "Raorchestes tinniens" eggs hatch in 36 days, but it can be longer or shorter depending n how hot or cold it is. Different frogs in the same species can look very different from each other because they can be different colors. Species of the genus "Raorchestes" also have different variations in their iris and pupil coloration. This makes it difficult for scientists to tell species apart and where they live.

People call the frogs in "Raorchestes" "bush frogs" in English. All of them live in trees except for "Raorchestes resplendens". It lives on the ground high in the mountains, on Anamudi.

One group of frogs live in the mountains in southern India (in the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats). Others live in northeastern India to Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos to southern China and Vietnam and Peninsular Malaysia. Many species live in the Western Ghats of India. Only eight species live in southeast Asia and China. 

The IUCN has looked at 38 species of "Raorchestes". Many are Critically Endangered. Scientists thought "Raorchestes travancoricus" was extinct, but they found more in 2004. Of the 38 speices, eight are data deficient and 23 are in the critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable Red List groups. The Amphibian Specialist Group's list of "lost frogs" (frogs not seen for decades) includes 10 "Raorchestes" species. There are not enough data or detailed studies about these frogs. Many of the frogs live in only a few places and can only live in places where the habitat is just right.

Several species in "Raorchestes" live in protected areas.

Scientists have found many more species in India since 2000. The following species are in the genus "Raorchestes":.

Polygenic score

A polygenic score is a concept in genetics. It is a number which adds up different aspects of a person as shown by their genetics. Bear in mind that is is now possible to have a very complete sequence of a person's genetic material (roughly, genes).

Polygenic scores are usually created from large scientific studies that look at the DNA of many people. These are called genome-wide association studies (GWASs). They can find out how important certain variants are. "Effect" is the name for the importance of a variant. Polygenic scores are made by adding up the effects of a large number of genetic variants. These genetic variants are known as alleles or SNPs.

It is used to estimate how likely a person is to have a trait or disease. It suggests how likely a person is to, for example, suffer a disease or disability as a result of their genetics. A polygenic score is the effect of many genetic variants on a trait. Polygenic scores can also tell how much of a trait or disease someone will have.

Polygenic scores can be used in adult humans. Polygenic scores are also sometimes used to decide if embryos are likely to have a disease.

Polygenic scores can make prediction of disease better. They help to know who will get the disease. Polygenic scores tell something new about a person's risk for a disease. This means that polygenic scores can be useful even if there are other already known risks. For example, a risk for lung cancer is smoking and a risk for heart disease is obesity. Some risks for diseases are only possible to know later in someone's life. However, polygenic scores can be made at the very beginning of someone's life. This way, polygenic scores can help to know someone's risk for disease earlier on. Some people have polygenic scores that say they are at high risk for a disease. These people can be helped earlier so they are less likely to get a disease.

Polygenic scores are very useful for diseases involving the heart, or blood. Some of the names of these diseases are coronary artery disease (plaque in the heart), hypertension (high blood pressure), atrial fibrillation (not-normal heartbeat), cerebrovascular disease (problems with blood in the brain). This means polygenic scores may be useful in diseases related to the heart, or diseases related to metabolism (how the body uses food). Polygenic scores can help find people who are at risk of coronary artery disease (plaque staying inside the arteries near the heart) even if their family members don't have it.

Hyperlipidemia is when there are too many fats in the blood. It is a condition that happens when there is a lot of cholesterol and triglycerides (lipids) in someone's blood. Polygenic scores can help to know a person's risk of getting hyperlipidemia. Polygenic scores might also help a doctor treat a person who already has hyperlipidemia. Someone who has family members with hyperlipidemia has less risk of getting hyperlipidemia if their polygenic score says that they have low risk.

ADHD is a disorder where someone has hyperactivity or issues with attention. There are polygenic scores for ADHD. These scores are related to if someone will be diagnosed with ADHD. These scores are also related to how severe their ADHD is. Polygenic scores for ADHD might help find which children have ADHD earlier in their lives.

Polygenic scores are good at predicting if someone will get Alzheimer's disease or not. Polygenic scores for Alzheimer's disease can help determine if the hippocampus, a part of the brain, will get smaller.

Some polygenic scores tell about, or predict, cognitive ability and how many years someone has gone to school.

Some other polygenic scores have been made, such as for schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, neuroticism, externalizing behaviors, extraversion, and anxiety.

Polygenic scores are used commonly in animal breeding and plant breeding. They help improve livestock and crops.

Polygenic scores are also used to see if embryos are at risk of developing various diseases. This lets parents choose the baby that will be the healthiest.

Polygenic scores are made by finding lots of people who have a disease, and lots of people who do not. The DNA of these people is studied. Scientists see if DNA variations happen more in the people with the disease, or happen less in the people with the disease. This figures out which DNA variations, or genes, are important. Because some of these DNA variations are more important than others, the more important DNA variations affect the polygenic score more. Often, very big groups of people are used to make polygenic scores. One of these big groups of people is the UK Biobank.

Populations sometimes have different frequencies of genes. Before making a polygenic score, the data is changed so that genes that are different between populations will not affect the results. Scientists can use different ways of making polygenic scores more accurate. They choose to not use very correlated DNA variations that are close together, to avoid counting the same DNA variation twice. They can include only the DNA variations that they are sure of, or they can include even DNA variations that they are not sure of. They can use machine learning to do this better. They can also use DNA variations about traits related to the trait or disease that they are studying, in order to have more data.

Rhacophorus turpes

The Htingnan flying frog or Htingnan whipping frog ("Rhacophorus turpes") is a frog. It lives in Myanmar. Scientists have seen it in one place: Htingnan in Kachin.

Rhacophorus larissae

The Cao Bang tree frog ("Rhacophorus larissae") is a frog. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Lung Muoi in Cao Bang Province in Vietnam. Scientists saw it 1400 meters above sea level.

Rhacophorus robertingeri

Inger's tree frog or Robert Inger's tree frog ("Rhacophorus verrucopus") is a frog. It lives in Vietnam in forests where the tree branches come together like the roof of a house. Scientists have seen it between 400 and 1700 meters above sea level. Scientists believe it may also live in Laos.

Rhacophorus pseudomalabaricus

The Anaimalai flying frog or false Malabar gliding frog ("Rhacophorus verrucopus") is a frog. It lives in the Anamalai Hills in India. Scientists have seen it between 955 and 1640 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 43.6 – 50.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female can be 66.8 mm long. All four legs are long and it has disks on its toes for climbing trees. The pupil in the eye goes up and down and opens side to side. The eardrum is hard to see.

"R. pseudomalabaricus" is the only frog in "Rhacophorus" that looks like a leaf: The skin of the frog's back and the tops of its legs are green with white spots. Sometimes there are black lines on its back and legs. Some frogs have clear stripes that look like the veins in leaves. Scientists think this helps the frog hide from animals that want to eat it. Adult frogs have thick green lines on their legs. The sides of the frog's body and legs are yellow-white in color. The ends of the toes are yellow-orange in color. The webbed skin between the toes is orange or red-orange in color.

This frog lives in tropical evergreen forests: the trees have broad leaves and do not have pine needles, but the leaves do not fall off in the winter because the place stays warm all year.

The frog lives in the Anaimalai Hills. People also call them the Elephant Hills on one side and the Cardamom Hills on the other side. This frog lives higher than 955 meters above sea level but lower than 1640 meters above sea level. Scientists say that the easiest way to tell "R. pseudomalabaricus" apart from "R. malabaricus" is to look at where the frog is: If the frog is too close to sea level, it is probably "R. malabaricus", and if it is high up in the hills, it is probably "R. pseudomalabaricus".

The frogs mate after the monsoon rains stop, from June to October. The male frog sings for the female frog: "trrr tik tik tik tik trrrr." The female frog makes a nest out of foam from her rear end. She stirs the foam with her back legs to make bubbles. The male frog holds on to her. She lays her eggs in the foam. Then the male frog puts sperm in the foam. The frogs stick together for an hour. Then the male frog lets go. Then the female frog covers the foam with leaves or grass. She uses her front legs to do this.

The female frog makes the nest on the ground or as high as 9 meters in the air. She builds the nest over water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water.

Sometimes primates find the nest and eat the eggs. Birds and primates can both eat the adult frog.

Human beings in India do not like this frog. Cardamom spice farmers think the frog eats the fruit that they grow. Some local people also think that the frog is a bad omen, which means that bad luck follows the frog. Farmers pay people to catch and kill this frog.

There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Humans cut down trees for wood to build with and to make places for animals to eat grass. Chemicals that farmers use to make plants grow, chemicals that kill insects, and pollution can also kill this frog. Some people also catch this frog to sell it as a pet. Other people hit the frog with cars.

Scientists do not know whether the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog.

Sandstone universities

The sandstone universities are a group of Australian universities. All were founded more than 100 years ago.

The universities in the group have buildings made mostly of sandstone. Some universities, such as the private Bond University, have sandstone-plated buildings, but are not considered sandstone universities.

These universities focus on research. Their courses have a strong emphasis on theory rather than practice. Students who enter the sandstone universities come from higher income families, and graduates usually have higher paid occupations or positions of influence. This prompts claims of elitism and social division.

The first university to be established in Australia was the University of Sydney in New South Wales in 1850. It was quickly followed by the University of Melbourne in 1853.

The richest university is the University of Sydney with endowments of about 2.5 billion dollars (annual reports). The least well endowed university in the group is the University of Tasmania with $561 million.

Azithromycin

Azithromycin is an antibiotic which is used to treat a number of different bacterial infections in humans such as strep throat, pneumonia or bronchitis. It was discovered in the late 1970s in Yugoslavia and is still one of the most popular antibiotics in the world. Azithromycin kills bacteria by stopping the protein production inside of it.

Azithromycin was discovered by a team of scientists working in the Research Institute of the pharmaceutical company PLIVA in Croatia in the late 70s. The drug was patented in 1981. The agreenment was signed between Pliva and Pfizer which allowed the use of azithromycin worldwide. Pliva sold it on the territory of Central and Eastern Europe under the name Sumamed becoming one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in Central and Eastern Europe. Pfizer which sold the drug under the name Zithromax also saw great commercial success receiving $2 billion in sales in the peak year.

Azithromycin is usually prescribed in the form of tablets. The drug targets the ribosome of the bacteria which prevents the translation of mRNA into proteins. Hence, the protein production stops in bacteria terminating the infection. Azithromycin is particularly effective against the microogranisms below:













The azithromycin was widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic to treat the coronavirus patients. However, the research found that the drug is ineffective and even increases the chances of hospitalisation.

Common side effects when taking azithromycin include feeling sick, diarrhoea, vomiting, losing your appetite, headaches, feeling dizzy or tired, changes to your sense of taste. Serious, but rare side effects are liver damage, heart rhythm change and serious allergic reactions.

In 2017, he received the Sahitya Ratna Padak from the and in 2019 he received the President Award of India 2018 for his contribution to Sanskrit language.

Upaddhyay published 15 research and original books. 
Upadhyay's most notable work was "Kalki Avatar and Muhammad" which was published in 1969 by Saraswat Vedanta Prakash Sangghha of Allahabad. The book is thought to be a partial adaption of the book (originally "Mithaq an-Nabiyeen", covenant of the prophets) by Ahmadiya scholar . Originally written in Hindi language, in this book, he discussed his claim of the mention of Islamic prophet Muhammad as the Hindu avatar of Kalki in the Hindu scriptures (Kalki Purana, Vedas and Bhavishya Purana, etc.). After publication, the book became very popular in India. Bengali scholar Asitkumar Bandyopadhyay translated the book into Bengali language along with Upadhyay's other two books 'Narashangsa and the Antim Rishi" and "Religious Unity in the Light of the Vedas and the Puranas" and combined it in one edition in the same name. The book was later also translated into English by several translators entitling "Muhammad in the Hindu scriptures" and "Muhammad in the Vedas and the Puranas", which gave the book immense popularity outside India. Besides popularity, the book was also criticized by many Hindu and Muslim bodies,
describing the book as wrong explanation of Hindu scriptures by many Hindu scholars and as exclusion of Hinduism and Hindu scriptures from people of the Book and devine books by some Islamic scholars, whereas both of the sectors claimed the subjects of the book as later interpolations in Hindu scriptures.

Ved prakash claimed in the book that the age of Kali Yuga refers to the Islamic Golden Age and the present time is "Anu Yuga" or the time of Atomic energy. Some of the claimed similarities between Kalki and Muhammad shown on the book along with other two books of the trilogy are:

The author claimed, in dashavatar, the scripturally mentioned Buddha Avatar was finally found as Gautama Buddha from Buddhism and later included in Hinduism, similarly Hindu followers should include Muhammad as Kalki Avatar after reading this book, and should follow him instead of waiting for him to come.
The content of the book is mainly a discussion of the claim that Kalki Avatar is Muhammad and the presence of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in Hindu scriptures. For this reason, Kalki Purana, Bhavishya Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Vedas etc. have been chosen as sources of Hindu scriptures. Hindu scholars criticize and oppose all these claims. An Indian organization 'Agniveer' criticized all these claims. In addition, the book "Ovranto Boidik Shastrer Alokey Kolki Obotar" (অভ্রান্ত বৈদিক শাস্ত্রের আলোকে কল্কি অবতার, Kalki Avatar in the Light of Inerrant Vedic Scriptures) (2019), and the January-March version of Amriter Sandhane magazine, both published by Bangladeshi wing of Back to Godhead, criticizes the claimed resemblance to Kalki Avatar. But in the October-December 2016 edition of Amriter shandhane, the Bangladeshi wing of Back to Godhead claimed the mention of Muhammad in Bhavishya Purana and hymn 127, book 20 of Atharvaveda in support of authenticity of vedic scriptures, which similared to the claim of the book. Hindu spiritual leader Ravi Shankar claimed in his book "Hinduism and Islam: The Common Thread" that Muhammad is explicitly mentioned as the name "Mahamada" () in of Bhavishya Purana: "An illiterate teacher will appear, Mohammed is his name, and he will give religion to the people of the desert", which also resembles the book.

Among all the similarities shown in the book with Kalki from the Kalki Purana, behavioral similarities are notable. For example: Muhammad is the last prophet of Islam with the last arrival of Kalki; Similarities of Muhammad's battles at various times with Kalki fighting on a white horse and sword, etc. Critics cite Muhammad's contrasts with Kalki against such similarities. Again in the book it is said that there are similarities in various matters even applying the literal meaning. Critics consider such literal application of the similarity of characters to be misleading and a misapplication of meaning.

It also contains critical comments on Mughal history (the texts refer to them as "Mukuls") and mentions a "Mahamad". Critics point out that the "Mahamed" described in the Bhavishya Purana is a "mlechcha" (foreigner, barbarian) and is the "Daitya" or "ghost" called Tripurasura' who is reborn., And the word "Muslim" has been said to mean a destroyer of religion. AK Ramanujan mentions Christ, Moses and Queen Victoria in a "properly updated Bhavisya Purana". 
Regarding "Pratisargaparva" Hazra says: Although it belongs to "Bhavishya Purana" (Ik.1.2-3), "Pratisargaparva" refers to Adam, Noah, Yakuta, Timurlong, Nadirshah, Akbar (Delishwar), Jayachandra and many others. The book also mentions British rule in India, even mentioning Calcutta and Parliament.

The book also claims that the Vedas contain prophecies of Muhammad. For example, in the Atharvaveda Kuntapa Sukta, 'Narasamsha', which is used for any praised person, the word Muhammad means praise, and the Sukta is claimed to describe Muhammad's prophecy. The sukta appears to refer to a justly praised king (Indra), although no Muhammadan association with them is found. Certain verses of the mantra are precisely identified and their semantic similarities are shown in order to create the context, mainly to prove Muhammad's prophecies. Critics see such spending as ulterior motives.

Hindu scholars dispute the book's claims. A criticism of the claimed resemblance to Kalki Avatar is found in the book “” published by Amriter Sandhane Prakashani. Indian organizations like Agniveer also criticized these claims. Criticism states,

Indian Hindu organisation "Agniveer" also judjed the book by the academic works of western scholars on Hinduism. According to the organisation, the book presents the story of Abrahamic Adam and Eve, Noah, described in the Pratisarga episode of Bhavisya Purana. According to scholars, the 'Pratisargaparva' portion of the Bhavishya Purana is considered a projected addition of the eighteenth or nineteenth century. 
Moriz Winternitz says that the texts which have come down to us under the title Bhavisya Purana, are undoubtedly not the ancient works of the original Bhavisya Purana quoted in the "Apastambiya Dharmasutra". As Gustav Glaser has shown, the surviving manuscripts of the Bhavisya Purana are neither ancient nor medieval versions of the original Bhavisya Purana. The author of this episode is believed to know both the English Bible and Arabic Islamic texts, but many of the words used here are derived from Arabic words and names, not from English sources.

The presence of Arabic words suggests that the corresponding portion of Bhavisya Purana was written well after the fourteenth century and must have been composed after the rise of the Mughal Empire and the availability of Arabic sources in India. This episode has therefore led many scholars to question the acceptability of the "Bhavishya Puranas" and that these Puranas are not accepted as authentic scriptures. In this Purana there are more uses of such words including ``Sante" (from Sunday), ``Farbari" (from February), ``Sixty" (from Sixty).

In the book "Satyarth Prakash", Dayanad Saraswati also rejected the claim of the mention of Muhammad in Atharvaveda, and he criticised the mention of Muhammad in Allopanishad calling it as a later fabrication to please Akbar.

The Bangladeshi wing of the organisation Agniveer extremely critisised the concepts of the book and the writer and they claimed that the writer doesn't exist in reality because his academic records are not found anywhere in Bengali.

Indian Islamic preacher Zakir Naik deliderately mentioned extensive references from this book in his various writings.

Pakistani former high comissioner Afrasiab Mehdi Hashmi discussed the book in his writing. Besides renowned international writers like Ali Unal, Shams Naved Usmani, Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood and , Ali Goma, Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri, , Nihat Hatipoğlu etc. discussed and praised the book. Also there are many incidents of conversion from Hinduism to Islam happened by reading this book.

Ziaur Rahman Azmi in his book ""Dirasat fil Yahudiyat wal Masihiyat Wal Adianil Hind"" (دراست في اليوديه والمسيحيه واديان الحند, Studies on Judaism, Christianity and Indian Religions) stated that, although most of the mainstream Muslim scholars do not regard Hindu scriptures as divine scriptures revealed from God rather than man-made Aryan literature, there may be three reasons behind the "possible" inclusion of Islamic prophecies in Hinduism. First one is, the period of the Indo-Aryan Migration was during the time of Prophet Abraham, during which another prophet may have come to India, under whose direction these prophecies are included. Or what many Hindus say, Rigveda is copied from Torah. Another view is that, according to Sultan Mubin, professor of Sanskrit at Shibli National College, Azamgarh, they are fabrications and later Hindu additions, incorporated by Hindus to please Muslim rulers, such as the Kalki Purana and the Bhavishya Purana, which contain many prophecies on Islamic matters. Azmi argues in support of this view that most of the Hindu scriptures were translated into Arabic in Bayt Al-Hiqmah during the reign of the Caliph Mamun bin al-Rashid, but even then, no author of that time mentioned anything of these prophecies in any of these books. For example, India by al-Biruni ("Tahqeeq ma lilhind min qaqulat mayqulat fi aliakal au marjula", رحقب ما للهند من مقولة مقولة في العقل او مرذولة) and the Arabic translations of two other Hindu scriptures. Regarding the translations, none of which said anything about these prophecies. Azmi himself supported the third view. Azmi Also said that, some Hindus including the founder of Arya Samaj Dayananda Saraswati and his followers also consider these to be fabrications. Besides, regarding the author of the book, Ved Prakash Upadhyay, Azmi said that although he claimed the verification of these prophecies in this book, he himself did not convert to Islam.

Bangladeshi Islamic scholar Abubakar Muhammad Zakaria, who has conducted advanced research and studies on Hinduism at the Islamic University of Madinah in Saudi Arabia, said about the book in his book "Hinduism wa tasur bad al firaq al islamiat biha" (Hinduism and some Islamic groups influenced by it) that, 
"There is a section for this Purana (Bhavishya Purana) called Kalki Purana, which touched upon Kalki Avatar, (Avatar that comes in the Kali time, or the last time) and what came in this Purana was the reality of Muhammad only, when one of their scholars (Ved Prakash Upaddhay) admitted that there is no Kalki Avatar except Muhammad and he mentioned evidence for that from this book, and claimed that it only applies to it, except that the Hindus differed in accepting this part of the book, and they said that it was plagiarized and it was developed by the later and it was included in the book at a very late time." Zakaria also criticized the book, saying that Narasangsha is described in verse 127 of the 20th volume of the Atharveda as Kalki which is not the main body of the Atharvaveda, he said that it is an anticipatory portion (Prakshipta Angsha or later interpolation) and subsequent connections, and claimed that prophecies of the Prophet Muhammad in Hindu scriptures were used by Hindus to make their scriptures acceptable to Muslims, which is a clever attempt, beginning with Akbar's reign to flatter Emperor Akbar by writing the Allopanishad, he claims that the Bhavishya Purana is completely fabricated and man-made with Hindu references. He says that Hinduism has a habit of adding everything in it's religion they got outside in the name of their own religion fabricatedly to attract people to come into their religion, this is also a result of that. In addition, all Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, are claimed to be adaptations of the beliefs of the migrated Japhethite Aryans (Zoroastrians and Rigvedians), indigenous Hemite Dravidians, and other Indo-Europian classical mythologies along with the influence of monotheism taken from Avestan concept of Ahura Mazda influenced by the geographically adjacent Arabian Semitic people, and says that since the Hindu texts do not "truely" contain the original Abrahamic monotheism of God or Allah, it is in neither consistent with the original tenets of Islam, nor these are original divine books, rather the pagan Advaita Vedanta philosophy, which developed the concept of Wahdat al-Wujud or Sufism in the name of Islam, arose. And as Hinduism established itself as an absorbing, inclusive, conformist and syncretistic doctrine from the Islamic point of view, as it has no spacific Aqida or Creed, according to Mahatma Gandhi, he claimed that, all Hindu scriptures are not inspired but man-made Aryan literature and the theory that this book attributed Kalki to Muhammad was a false and deceitful attempt.

The plan is to learn how to find medical problems earlier, before people have symptoms. People who join will be told about their risks of various diseases – first about diabetes and heart disease. The plan is to detect who is at risk of developing all types of diabetes, and why.

Barbenheimer

Barbenheimer is an Internet phenomenon and internet meme that began before the release of "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer", on July 21, 2023. The word is a portmanteau of the movies' titles. 

The reason why this meme happened is because "Barbie", a fantasy comedy movie based on the fashion doll Barbie, and "Oppenheimer", a biographical thriller movie about theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, caused a comedic response because they were being released on the same date. "Polygon" described the two movies as extremely opposite to each other.

The meme gained popularity with several movie theatres selling both movies as double features. Actor Tom Cruise, "Barbie" director Greta Gerwig and actress Margot Robbie took part of the "Barbenheimer" phenomenon and watched both movies. In an interview, "Oppenheimer" actor Cillian Murphy supported the phenomenon, saying "My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain."

Many critics were surprised by how "Barbenheimer" was helping the release of both movies being release on the same day, whereas normally when two major movies were being released on the same day, they would compete at the box office. 

"Barbie" made $22.3 million in Thursday night previews, while "Oppenheimer" made $10.5 million. This was the first time two movies have made more than $10 million each in their previews in 2023.

The movies earned a combined 21 nominations at the 96th Academy Awards, both movies nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, with "Oppenheimer" receiving the most of the year at 13.

It was released on July 21, 2023 to positive reviews. 

With over $960 million at the box office, "Oppenheimer" is the highest-grossing biographical movie of all time, beating "Bohemian Rhapsody" (2018).

The movie has won multiple awards including five Golden Globe Awards and seven at the 77th British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film. It is nominated for 13 categories at the 96th Academy Awards, which includes the Best Picture category. At the 96th Academy Awards, "Oppenheimer" would win seven awards including Best Picture.

Cillian Murphy plays Oppenheimer, with Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife, Katherine "Kitty" Oppenheimer, Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, Oppenheimer's military handler, Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, a senior member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and Florence Pugh as psychiatrist and Oppenheimer's mistress Jean Tatlock. Other members of the supporting cast include Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, Jason Clarke, Dylan Arnold, Gustaf Skarsgård, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine and Tom Conti.


"Oppenheimer" premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was released in the United States and United Kingdom on July 21, by Universal Pictures. It is Nolan's first movie not to be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures domestically or internationally since "Memento" (2000). The movie had strong positive reviews with a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes.

The movie was released on the same day as "Barbie", a fantasy comedy movie directed by Greta Gerwig. Since the two movies have completely different tones and genres, many social media users have taken to making memes about how the two movies represent different audiences, and how they should be seen as a double feature. The trend has been called "Barbenheimer".

Each country had one pair of dancers, each pair performing a dance in which the cultures of the individual countries could be showcased to the rest of Europe.

The Eurovision Dance Contest 2007 was hosted in London, United Kingdom. Each couple performed two 1 minute 30 seconds dances: the first dance was a ballroom or Latin dance while the second was a freestyle dance. The event was hosted by Graham Norton and Claudia Winkleman. 

The viewers from each country (except for Greece, who used a jury) were able to vote for their favorite entries. The ten favorite entries from each countries televote were given a set of points, with 12 points going to the most voted entry and 1 point going to the 10th.

The Eurovision Dance Contest 2008 was held in Glasgow, United Kingdom. Both Graham Norton and Claudia Winkleman returned as the hosts. 

All pairs had to include one professional and one celebrity dancer. Only one, 2 minute dance, was performed by each couple. A professional jury was introduced to the competition having approximate weight of 20% of the outcome, while the remaining 80% came from televoting. The jurors consisted of four experts from non-participating countries: Singapore, France, Germany and Slovenia.

Love Island

Love Island is a British reality television series. It is a revival of an earlier show "Celebrity Love Island", but this time the contestants were normal people. It began in 2015 and is currently hosted by Maya Jama. Previous hosts include Caroline Flack and Laura Whitmore.

The show is about group of contestants, referred to as Islanders, living in a villa on an island, constantly under video surveillance. On the first day, the Islanders couple up for the first time based on first impressions, but over the duration of the series they must "re-couple" or choose to remain with their current partner.

Any Islander who remains single after the re-coupling is eliminated from the game. Islanders can also be eliminated by the public vote. Sometimes, the Islanders will have to choose which one of them will be leaving. In the final, the public vote towards which couple they want to win the series and therefore take home £50,000.

The series has had very mixed reviews. It is one of the UK's most popular reality TV shows. However, the show has also received criticism from many people for potentially making viewers feel insecure about their bodies. There is also worry about the impacts contestants may face from appearing on the show.

Several contestants have become famous after appearing on the show, including Molly-Mae Hague, Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, Laura Anderson, Wes Nelson and Gemma Owen.

Santali Speed Production

Santali Speed Production, also known as Sollywood Production, has its presence in the Indian states of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam, Orissa, and parts of Nepal (especially Jhapa District and Morang District), where Santals live. Santali films are made in the Santali language.

Although some initiatives have been taken to support Santali cinema, allowing it to prosper, only three films managed to make it to the big screen : "Chando Likhon", which was released in 2001, was the first film to be made on 35 mm movie film; second in this series was "Sagun Ena Sohag Dular" (2003), which was loosely based on the 1982 Bollywood film "Nadiya Ke Paar"; "Jewee Jurie (Life Partner)" (2009) was produced by Santali Speed Production and released widely in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha, and others.

"Bonodal (The Change)" (2016), Nepal's first historic Santali feature film, was produced and directed by Kiran Khatiwada.

Santali cinema has not been able to create an identity as a film industry like most other cinemas in India. Every year about 8 to 10 films are made and released directly, on CDs only.
None of them are released in cinema halls, due to low budget and little support by the state government in development of the cinema. Music albums are preferred over video films, as the budget is very low and production cost is easily recovered. The number of these ranges from 10 to 20. Santali cinema has a good scope in the states of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Assam and Odisha. Most of its viewers reside in these regions.

As there is no film development corporation in Jharkhand, the Santali film industry is in a difficult position. Films and music albums are made less in number and distributed inefficiently.

In Jharkhand, Dhanbad, Jamshedpur and their surroundings, don't have proper cinema halls and ticket prices are very low compared to multiplexes all over India. So releasing a film in cinema halls is not very profitable.

Skimmer (spa)

A skimmer or surface separator (separates a substance from the surface of a liquid), is an essential accessory for the maintenance and cleaning of the water in a swimming pool . It is used to remove all the surface dirt floating on the water surface, such as leaves, tanning oil and human secretions. These impurities remain suspended on the surface, affect the appearance of the water and are not always removed by the conventional vacuuming process. The skimmer is installed directly in the surface water suction system and also has the function of controlling the water level to prevent accidental overflows. In the United States and Portugal, the use of skimmers in the construction of swimming pools is mandatory, regulated and standardized by competent bodies.

Typically, a skimmer draws water from the pool through a rectangular opening in the wall, at the top of the pool, connected through a device installed in one (or more) walls of the pool. The internal parts of the skimmer are accessed from the pool deck through a circular or rectangular cover, approximately one foot in diameter. If the pool's water pump is operational, it draws water from the pool through a hinged floating chute (which operates from a vertical position at a 90-degree angle to the pool, to prevent leaves and debris from being washed back into the pool by wave action), and down into a removable "skimmer basket", whose purpose is to catch leaves, dead insects and other larger floating debris.

There are different types of skimmers that can be used for different purposes. The most common types of skimmers include:


The density of fresh water is 1,000 kilograms per cubic meter, while the density of seawater varies between 1,020 and 1,030 kilograms per cubic meter. Oil is less dense than fresh water and seawater, so it floats in both types of water, but due to the difference in density the oil and fat particles, dispersed in the water, will reach the surface more quickly in a saltwater or seawater pool, being in both cases, "the only possible means" to remove them, to recirculate the water surface through skimmers .


Recommender system

A recommender system is usually a computer system which makes suggestions to the user about how to do a task.

What they do is make suggestions rather than actually solve problems. One key objective is to make sure the user has considered standard issues in the domain of choice. By domain is meant subject or topic. It is a weakness of regular AI software that it is not good for problems which involve personal preference or choice. The key concept for a recommender system is "relevance".

It is already clear that many data bases have so much material that manual searches are bound to miss some important items. The first actual mention of the term "recommender system" was in a technical report as a "digital bookshelf" in 1990 by Jussi Karlgren at Columbia University.

Prince-bishop

A prince-bishop is a type of monarch who reigns over a principality and is also a bishop or other high-ranking clergy member. 

They were very common in medieval Europe, especially in the Holy Roman Empire. From the 4th century onward, many bishops took control of cities and the surrounding areas. 

A prince-bishop was initially considered to be an elected monarch because the position was not hereditary and the successors of prince-bishops were chosen in the same way as an ordinary bishop.

The Holy Roman Empire had many prince-bishops, who controlled areas called "Prince-Bishoprics". After the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, the title began to fall out of use and it was officially abolished by the Pope in 1951.

The last prince-bishop in the world is currently Joan Enric Vives Sicília, who is one of the two Co-Princes of Andorra.

Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg

The Prince Bishopric of Augsburg was a prince-bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire, meaning it was a territory ruled by a prince-bishop. Its territory included a large portion of the Diocese of Augsburg, which the Prince-Bishop only had spiritual power over.

The prince-bishopric was established in the city of Augsburg and its surrounding territory in the 4th century. 

Around the year 888, Augsburg was granted Imperial Immediacy, a high rank given to a territory of the Holy Roman Empire with a high degree of autonomy.

In 1276, the City of Augsburg became a Free Imperial City, meaning that it was now separate from the rest of the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg. This meant that the capital of the Prince-Bishopric was changed to Dillingen an der Donau.

From 1632 to 1635, the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg was occupied by the Swedish Empire.

In 1803, as part of the German mediatisation, the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg became a part of Bavaria.

Princess Maria Gabriela of Orléans-Braganza

Princess Maria Gabriela of Brazil (Maria Gabriela Josefa Fernanda Yolanda Micaela Rafaela Gonzaga; born 8 June 1989) is a member of the Vassouras branch of the House of Orléans-Braganza, fourth in line of succession to the Brazilian throne, and the youngest daughter of Antônio, Prince Imperial of Brazil and of Christine, Princess Imperial of Brazil. Living in Châteu de Beloeil, Belgium, Gabriela is relatively active in the Brazilian monarchist movement, participating in some events. Graduated in social communication and architecture, the princess is also an amateur singer with media recognition.

Princess Maria Gabriela was born in Petrópolis, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, as the second and youngest daughter of Prince Antônio of Brazil and Princess Christine of Ligne. By his father, she is great-great-granddaughter of Empress Isabel of Brazil, while by his mother, she is great-granddaughter of Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. Currently, she occupies the fourth position in the Vassouras lines of succession to the defunct Brazilian throne, which is currently lead by her uncle Dom Bertrand of Orleáns e Bragança.

She graduated with a bachelor's degree in social communication from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, focused on advertising and marketing. She lived in London for a while due to her work as an architect, until she moved to the Château de Belœil, Belgium, where she currently lives with her aunt Princess Eleonora and the House of Ligne (her mother's family).

Princess Maria Gabriela regularly attends some monarchical events such as the National Monarchical Meeting and smaller meetings, as well as masses with her parents. Part of the reason for her move to Europe is related to the quest for a prince to marry her and thus maintain her dynastic rights. According to some uncredited sources, there was an engagement between the Princess Maria Gabriela and Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma, from the Ducal House of Bourbon-Parma, but the rumor has been dismissed as false through a note published by the Imperial Family on their official website.

Her full name is "Maria Gabriela Josefa Fernanda Yolanda Micaela Rafaela Gonzaga of Orleans and Bragança and Ligne". The names "Maria" and "Jose" (Josefa) are in the names of the members of the whole family in honor of the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph, as well as "Miguel" (Micaela), "Rafael" (Rafaela) and "Gabriel" (Gabriela), in devotion to the archangels. "Fernanda" (Fernando) and "Yolanda", in this case, are the names of the princess's godparents, Prince Fernando of Orléans-Braganza and Archduchess Yolande of Austria. 


As member of the House of Orléans-Braganza, she is recipient of the following orders:

Eurovision Song Contest 1958

The Eurovision Song Contest 1958 was the third edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. The contest was held on Wednesday 12 March 1958 and was hosted in Hilversum, Netherlands by Hannie Lips. All countries from the previous contest returned, except for the United Kingdom. Sweden entered for the first time.

The winner was decided by voting of ten experts from each country, who cast their vote for the best song.

Second homes

Second homes are generally bought for holiday use by wealthy people whose main home is in a city. The holiday homes are generally in rural and seaside areas. In some places this is seen as a good thing - bringing money into the area. In other places its seen as a problem - pushing up prices so local people cannot buy a home and leaving the area half empty outside the holiday season. 

In Sweden and Finland about 20% of houses in the late 1990s were second homes. In Spain it was 16%, Italy and Greece both 14%. in 2018-19 there were 772,000 households in England with second homes. In 2023 foreigners bought nearly 40% of houses for sale in Mallorca, Menorca and Ibiza. A referendum on banning building new second homes in Switzerland was passed, with the support of 50.6%. In 2016, 83% of voters in St Ives agreed in a referendum that it should be a requirement for new homes to be occupied as the owner’s main residence.

There has long been resentment of second home owners in Wales, and this is partly because of the effect on prices and partly about protecting the Welsh language. About two hundred holiday homes were burned down in the 1980s and 90s. The Welsh government has altered the planning, property and taxation rules to discourage second homes.

EKI Energy

EKI Energy Services Limited (EKI) is a company that provides climate change advisory services and is based in Indore, India. It has a strong global presence and started its operations in 2008 as a proprietorship firm before becoming a closely held public limited company in 2011. On April 7, 2021, EKI Energy shares were listed on the BSE SME Platform.

The company's main focus is on developing projects to reduce carbon emissions and mobilizing carbon credits for the global market. It has customers in more than 40 countries and offices in 17 countries. As of now, EKI has mobilized over 200 million offsets.

EKI was founded in 2008 and later expanded its services related to carbon emissions. Over the next seven years, it helped Indian and foreign businesses register for carbon credits.

Initially, the company generated revenue through consulting fees. However, due to factors like low market awareness, declining credit prices, and issues with the carbon trading mechanism, the carbon credit market became less appealing to businesses. Despite these challenges, EKI continued to grow and eventually became a closely held public limited company, expanding its operations.

In November 2020, EKI expressed its intention to have an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and in January 2021, it declared its plan to be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange to expand its business both within and outside India.

In January 2022, the company achieved a valuation of $1 billion.

Rhacophorus borneensis

The Bornean flying frog ("Rhacophorus borneensis") is a frog. Scientists have seen it in Borneo in Malaysia.

This frog lives high in tall trees, so scientists do not know much about it. They do not know what the male frog sounds like when he sings. They do not know what the eggs or tadpoles look like. Scientists saw some frogs sitting on branches 1 m over a pool of water, so they think the frogs might lay eggs on branches so that tadpoles fall into the water when they hatch.

This frog is about 50.9 mm long from nose to rear end. It has large disks on its toes for climbing. Its feet have webbed skin all the way to the climbing disks. This frog has green skin on its back and a white mouth. The skin of the front legs near the body is black with yellow spots and blue spots. The skin of the sides is yellow-orange with black spots. Some of the webbed skin is yellow-orange. Some is black with blue marks. The skin of the belly is yellow-orange in color. The iris of the eye is red in color. Male and female frogs both have black color on their back legs, but the female also has blue spots.

There are fewer of this frog than there were because people catch the frogs to sell as pets, because people cut down forests to get wood to build things with, and because people catch the frog to use it to make medicines.

Vidbir

Yevrobachennia: Natsionalnyi Vidbir ("meaning "Eurovision: National Selection"), informally known as Vidbir", is a Ukrainian music competition which began in 2016. The winner of the contest gets the chance to represent Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest.

Each contest lasts for one show. Once all of the entrants have performed, they are ranked by both a jury and a public vote which give a set of points based on the rankings (for example, if there are six contestants, then the highest ranked contestant gets 6 points, with the lowest getting 1). The points are then combined and the highest scorer wins. 

Atrial fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation is when the heart beats in a fast and irregular way that is not normal. During atrial fibrillation (AF) it is the upper chambers of the heart that beat in an abnormal way. AF may not have any symptoms and the patient may not notice that it is happening at all. It often begins as short periods of abnormal beating, which then become longer or start to happen all the time. It may also start as other forms of arrhythmia such as atrial flutter that then become AF. Episodes with symptoms may involve heart palpitations, fainting, light-headedness (dizziness), shortness of breath, or pains in the chest. AF is may cause an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. Although the causes of AF are not exactly known it is associated with heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, COPD, being older, sleep apnoea, excess alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis. About 50% of AF cases are not associated with these risk factors. Doctors might suspect AF after feeling the pulse and then order an ECG to confirm the diagnosis. Atrial fibrillation is the most common serious abnormal heart rhythm and, as of 2020, affects more than 33 million people worldwide.

Treatment of AF includes medications to slow the heart rate to a near-normal range (known as rate control) or to convert the rhythm (beating pattern) to normal sinus rhythm (known as rhythm control). A treatment called electrical cardioversion can convert AF to normal heart beats and is often necessary for emergency use. A form of surgery called cardiac ablation (burning away part of the heart) may be done to treat AF. A healthy lifestyle may also be prescribed by health-care professionals. For those at low risk of stroke, AF does not always require blood-thinning though some healthcare providers may prescribe aspirin or other anti-clotting medication. For those at medium or high risk doctors will generally recommend an anti-clotting medication such as warfarin and other oral anticoagulants. Most people are at a higher risk of getting stroke and while these medications reduce stroke risk, they increase rates of major bleeding.

Lewis Strauss

Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss (January 31, 1896January 21, 1974) was an American businessman, philanthropist and naval officer. He was one of the original members of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). In the 1950s he was the chairman of the commission. Strauss was a major figure in the creation of nuclear weapons after World War II, nuclear energy policy, and nuclear power in the United States.

Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss was born in Virginia in 1896. His parents were Ashkenazi Jews. When he was a child, Strauss was interested in physics. He wanted to become a scientist but sold shoes instead. In World War One, Strauss worked for Herbert Hoover. He also helped Hoover try to become President of the United States of America in the 1920s. After Strauss's mother died of cancer, he met Leó Szilárd because he wanted to learn if radiation could be used to cure cancer. 

In the 1930s, Strauss joined many American Jewish groups. He helped raised money to help Jewish refugees come to the United States to save them from the Nazis. Strauss also joined the United States Navy in the Second World War . In the Navy, he helped make weapons. After the war, President Harry S Truman hired Strauss to lead the Atomic Energy Commission. Strauss told Truman to develop a hydrogen bomb because the Soviet Union had an atomic bomb but Dr. Robert Oppenheimer thought he should not have done that.

After Dwight Eisenhower became president, Lewis Strauss called J. Edgar Hoover and told him that Robert Oppenheimer was a Communist. The FBI then tried to decide if Oppenheimer were a spy for the Soviet Union. Many of Oppenheimer’s friends said that Strauss was unfair to Oppenheimer. 

President Eisenhower wanted to make Strauss the Secretary of Commerce but the United States Senate did not approve of this choice. One of the reasons was because people were angry about Oppenheimer. It is because of Strauss's role in Oppenheimer's security clearance being removed, many historians have seen him as a villain in American history. The main reason why he had Oppenheimer's clearance removed was because of a personal vendetta against him. 

Strauss's failed confirmation was the first time that a United States Cabinet nominee failed to be confirmed since 1925 and the eighth overall. Senators who voted against Strauss's nomination included future U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.

In 1962, Strauss wrote a book called "Men and Decisions". In the 1970s, Strauss got sick with lymphosarcoma. He died in 1974. Strauss was buried in a Jewish cemetery in Virginia.

Phil Brown played Strauss for the television program "Oppenheimer". Robert Downey Jr. played Strauss in the movie "Oppenheimer".

Dance the Night

"Dance the Night" is a song by British and Albanian singer Dua Lipa from "", the soundtrack of the movie "Barbie" (2023). Atlantic and Warner Records released it as the soundtrack's first song on 25 May 2023. 

A disco song that has cello, violin, viola, strings, and bass in its music, "Dance the Night" is about dancing throughout the night despite a lot of sadness.

Before signing on to produce the "Barbie" soundtrack, producer Mark Ronson received a text from his friend George Drakoulias that simply stated, "Barbie?" Before production, director Greta Gerwig needed a disco song that would be the main song of a dance scene in the movie, so she sent Ronson a playlist of what she was looking for. Ronson and colleague Andrew Wyatt created a track that Gerwig loved and used for dance rehearsals. This song would later become "Dance the Night".

"Dance the Night" is two minutes and 56 seconds long.

In the chorus, Lipa sings the lyrics: "Watch me dance the night away / My heart could be burnin' but you won't see it on my face / Watch me dance, dance the night away / I still keep the party running". She compares the tears streaming down her face while she cries to diamonds.

The music video for "Dance the Night" was released alongside the song. It features a cameo appearance of "Barbie" director Greta Gerwig, and clips from the movie featuring Margot Robbie, Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, and other cast members. 

The video has a pink set, and Lipa learns new choreography in it after discovering a disco ball that had been ordered for the shoot has fallen to the ground. She dances atop a huge Barbie heel, and the cameos happen during a disco party, after which Gerwig leaves her director's chair to support Lipa's performance and question the events that led up to the disco ball being destroyed. Fans said that the smashed disco ball was a symbolism of the end of Lipa's "Future Nostalgia" era. This theory was supported by Ronson in an interview with "Vulture".

On 28 May 2023, "Billboard" listeners voted "Dance the Night" as their favorite new release of the week. At the end of the year, "Billboard" named the song the 15th best song of the year.

Official Charts Company said the song sounded like a return "to the disco-soaked sonics of "Future Nostalgia"...with a plastic sheen, of course".

Quinolone antibiotic

Fluoroquinolones are a group of chemical substances used for antibiotic treatment of bacterial infection. They can be used to treat many different infections, since they work against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, the two main types of bacteria. Benefits of using fluoroquinolones for treatment include their ease of access, simple formulas, large amount of bacterial targets, effectiveness against infection, and unlikely chance of side effects.

Fluoroquinolones are a sub-class of quinolone antibiotics, named for their chemical structure. Fluoroquinolones have a similar structure to quinolones; two fused carbohydrate rings with a fluorine atom attached to the sixth carbon and a nitrogen atom replacing the eighth carbon atom.

The following medicines are fluoroquinolone antiobiotics:


Ciproflaxin is the most frequently prescribed fluoroquinolone antibiotic, for its strength against gram-negative bacilli bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella.

Fluoroquinolones kill bacteria by damaging their DNA, through halting enzyme function. Enzymes Topoisomerase I and IV are affected such that the supercoiling of bacterial genetic material is not functional.

The following side effects can occur during fluoroquinolone antibiotic treatment:


A growing number of bacteria are becoming resistant to quinolone antibiotics due to overuse. To slow the spread of bacterial resistance, fluoroquinolones are usually used as treatment after specific antibiotic medicines have been ruled out.

Elsagate

Elsagate is a neologism referring to a controversy about videos posted on YouTube and YouTube Kids. The videos were titled family friendly, but contained innapropriate themes such as graphic violence, sexual content, fetishes, vulgar language, drugs, alcohol, injections, diseases, crude humour and dangerous activities.

The videos showed characters from family-oriented media, mostly used without any legal permission, thus having no restrictions to the characters' usage limits. The term was created through a mix between Disney's Elsa character, frequently featured in the videos, and the suffix "-gate", used for scandals. A few channels, such as Toy Freaks, featured real children for videos, raising concern from the public about the chance of child abuse being involved.

Daptomycin

Daptomycin is a natural antibiotic used to treat gram-positive bacterial infections. A unique mechanism of action has allowed low rates of bacterial cross-resistance to daptomycin, making it an effective treatment to severe infection such as Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) and Methicillin-reistant Staphlococcus aureus (MRSA).

Daptomycin is also commonly referred to as Cubicin or abbreviated to DAP. It is a lipopeptide, meaning that it is made of a combination of fatty acids and protein complexes. Daptomycin is biosynthetic, first extracted from "Streptomyces roseosporus".

Daptomycin is used to treat the following medical conditions:


Daptomycin kills gram-positive bacteria by changing the structure of the cell membrane. Daptomycin enters the bacterial cell membrane by chemical exchange with calcium ions and phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG).

Royal Marines

The Royal Marines are a group of soldiers in the United Kingdom that are deployed from sea to the land. Marines are specially trained in operating from landing craft, boarding ships at sea, and attacking a wide range of enemies.

The first British Marine unit was formed in 1664 after King Charles II ordered a regiment of soldiers trained to operate at sea to be raised. They were called the Admiral’s Regiment. Marines were important due to the expansion of the British Empire. By 1740, 10 sea service regiments were active however regiments often only lasted short amounts of time because they were raised when they were necessary to serve during wars. As well as boarding ships, Marines would be tasked to attack enemy coastal positions.

In 1746 the 10 Marine regiments were brought together to form a corps and were placed under command of the Admiralty. After taking part in many battles on land and at sea, such as the Battle of Trafalgar, the Marines were awarded the “Royal” title by King George III, so they are now called the “Royal Marines”. By 1900 there were about 18,800 Royal Marines, 15,000 Light Infantry and 4,000 Artillery.

During the First World War, the Marines numbers increased to 55,000. They took place in a variety of battles and won 5 Victoria Crosses.

During the beginning of the Second World War Marines were trained to defend ports however, due to a shortage of army units trained to take place in raids, Royal Marines were trained in this role. These Marines were trained in a variety of skills such as fighting in buildings and rock climbing. 17,000 Marines took place in D-Day.

Since the end of WW2 Royal Marines have served in many conflicts including the Korean War, the Falklands War and Afghanistan.

The Royal Marines are structured into Battalions called “Commandos”, Companies called “Squadrons” and Platoons called “Troops”. Royal Marine Commando Units are supported by Specialist Army Commando Units. The Royal Marines are currently structured as follows:

Combo XLR/P10

The Combo XLR/TRS socket or Neutrik NCJ6FI-S, is a type of female socket connector capable of supporting two types of jack connectors: the XLR connector, known as the "Canon Plug", used to connect microphones and mixers, and the TRS plug for stereo (TRS:Tip-ring-sleeve) or TS plug for mono (TS:Tip-Sleeve), also known as: Banana Plug, or P10 plug, which are used in musical instruments like guitars, keyboards, bass, etc...

At the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, the Tyrolean acoustics engineer Bernhard Weingartner noticed that the sound tended to decrease. The reason for this was that the DIN audio connectors used by Austrian television failed under the influence of bad weather. . Weingartner began in 1974, initially on his own, with the development of an inexpensive but high-quality version of the XLR connector. Over the following years, the Neutrik company became the world leader in the XLR audio connector market. Neutrik connectors have been standardized to the stage and studio standard as standard IEC 61076-2-103.

Because amplifier and mixer equipment often requires inputs for both TRS phone jacks and XLR connectors, Neutrik and Amphenol offer several combo connector models that accept both XLR jacks like TS or TRS phone jacks. 

NEUTRIK won the 2011 EMEA+ InAVation Award in the category "Most Innovative Commercial AV Accessory 2011". The award was presented at Integrated Systems Europe 2011 in Amsterdam.

Tetrachloroethylene

Tetrachloroethylene is a pleasant-smelling colourless liquid that is used for dry-cleaning. It is also known as perchloroethylene and perc for short. It has the chemical formula and it is composed of carbon and twice the chlorine. It was first made in 1839 in France.
Perchloroethylene is a colourless liquid at room temperature. It has a mild, sweet odour that most people can smell even in small amounts. It is much heavier than water and it does not mix with water, because Perc is nonpolar while water is polar. It can mix with many other solvents. Perc boils at 121 degrees Celsius and freezes at –22 degrees Celsius.

Its molecule is very similar to ethylene but with chlorines instead of hydrogens in ethylene.

Perc has been used in dry cleaning since the 1930s. It was introduced as a safe alternative to carbon tetrachloride (extremely poisonous to the liver) and flammable solvents like gasoline. 

Years ago, dry cleaners used to throw away dirty perc after a few uses. The modern dry cleaning machines have mechanism to distill (boiling and condensing again) the perc for re-use.

Perchloroethylene was previously used as a parasite medication for animals.

Perc has low toxicity but people who inhale it for a long time can become unconscious. Perc's ability to remove oils is very strong and can hurt the skin. It is not inflammable or explosive.


Trichloroethylene

Trichloroethylene is a chemical compound with the formula . It is known as TCE for short. TCE is pleasant-smelling colourless liquid. TCE is used as a solvent to dissolve oils. It was previously used in anaesthesia after chloroform, TCE for use in anaesthesia was dyed blue so it would not be confused with chloroform which smells, weighs and looks the same. It was sold under the name "Trilene". 
TCE was a very common dry cleaning solvent but it was way too strong and caused damage to clothes. Dry cleaners today use the safer perchloroethylene (PCE). TCE is still sometimes used as a stain remover.

TCE is used as a solvent to clean oils from metals but it can break down in presence of metals so producers add various chemicals into commercial TCE to prevent any unwanted reactions.

Breathing trichloroethylene vapours can cause unconsciousness. It should be used in well-ventilated places. Its effects are similar to being drunk with alcohol. It can harm the liver in long time.

Dellinger effect

Solar flares are large bursts of energy coming from the sun. On Earth, these flares disrupt radio communication. In years when there are many such flares, the energy they release can charge what is known as the D-layer of the Ionosphere, up to about above the earth. This changes the way this layer reflects or absorbs short wave radio waves. This effect only occurs on the day-side of the earth (on the night-side, there's little radiation from the sun. The effect will atenuate signals with a frequency of up to 300 MHz. The phenomenon can last from several minutes, to several hours. In English, the effect is also called "short wave fadeout". 

Hans Mögel, a German physicist first discovered the effect, around 1930. John Howard Dellinger, an American telecommunications engineer, also described it, around 1935. For this reason, the effect is known as Delllinger effect, or Mögel-Dellinger effect today.

There is black color on the sides of the body. There is some blue-green color and some yellow color on the legs. Some times the adult female frog will have light green color on her webbed skin.

On June 28, 2018, a music video for the song was released a day after his public memorial service. The music video was directed by JMP. 

In the video, it begins with a figure introducing themselves as Gekyume and asking different questions. The figure is in pitch black and all you can see are their eyes. In the next scene, X walks up to a casket which has his younger self in it. Older X looks at his younger self and the younger X comes to life to attack him. The two Xs start fighting in the church and older X kicks his younger self into an alley. The video cuts to a hooded figure talking to X. The figure wants X to live a life of love rather than hate. X defeats his younger self in the fight and brings his body to an all-white area. A piece of paper appears that says "People change, things change and so did I." The words "LONG LIVE PRINCE X" appear over the screen.

Retirement home

A retirement home is a place where old people live together. Sometimes, these places are known as old people's homes or old age homes. In many ways these homes are like hotels: Each resident has a room or suite, with its own bathroom. In some cases, there are rooms for couples. Like in a hotel there's staff who prepares the meals, the residents usually eat together. 

Such homes are for elderly people who have special needs. Some of these people need help with everyday tasks, such as washing themselves in the morning, or changing from one set of clothes to another. Many of the people in these homes suffer from age-related diseases, which makes it very hard or impossible for them to live alone, without help.

Putting someone in a retirement home is expensive: the price charged usually depends on the level of help the person needs. Very often, relatives care for the people, before they are sent to retirement homes. Only when the burden becomes too big are people sent to retirement homes. Nursing homes are very similar, but there are for those people who need a lot of medical attention.

Many of the people in retirement homes suffer from age-related diseases, such as dementia.

Poniatowski gems

Prince Stanisław Poniatowski (1754–1833) was a a wealthy Polish nobleman.
He inherited approximately 154 antique gems from his uncle, King Stanisław August Poniatowski of Poland, who died in 1798. He then commissioned gems to be made, to look similar to those he had inherited. He was given more than 2,600 engraved gems. When he died in 1833, it became clear that the gems were forgeries. At first, people had thought that they were real classical pieces. In 1839, they were sold at an auction. That auction was a failure. Today, the gems have been scattered, and many have been lost. Those that remain are seen as good examples of neoclassical carving. These gems are known as Poniatowski gems today.

Yitzhak Shamir later took over the Lechi and ordered the assassination of some British politicians he said were anti-Semitic. David Ben-Gurion said the Lechi were terrorists.

After Adolf Hitler attacked Poland, the Irgun stopped fighting the British Empire since they thought it was more important to fight the Nazis but Stern thought the war would make it easier to fight the British so he left the Irgun and started the Lechi. 

Stern said that the British were so dangerous to the Jews that Zionists should be willing to work with Mussolini to stop them and Stern used kidnapping and assassination to fight the British. The British said they would give money to anyone who could find Stern. Then in 1942, the British found Stern and killed him.

Septic tank

A septic tank is an underground chamber made of concrete, fiberglass, or plastic through which sewage flows for basic sewage treatment. Settling and anaerobic digestion processes reduce solids and organic material. The treated liquid effluent is commonly disposed of in a septic drain field. This provides further treatment. Nonetheless, groundwater pollution may occur and can be a problem.

The term "septic" refers to the anaerobic bacterial environment that develops in the tank that decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank. Septic tanks can be coupled with other onsite wastewater treatment units such as biofilters or aerobic systems involving artificially forced aeration.
A septic tank has one or more concrete or plastic tanks between 4,500 and 7,500 liters (1,000 and 2,000 gallons). One end is connected to a pipe coming from a building and the other to a septic drain field. These pipe connections are made with a T-shaped pipe, allowing liquid to enter and exit without disturbing anything on the top of the water. New tanks usually have two chambers. Each has an access opening and cover and is separated by a dividing wall with openings located about midway between the floor and the roof of the tank.

A septic system that is working correctly is odor-free. The tank only needs periodic inspection and emptying. Concrete, fiberglass, or plastic tanks often will last about 50 years.

Septic tank additives have been promoted by some manufacturers with the aim to improve the effluent quality from septic tanks, reduce sludge build-up, and reduce odors. These additives are usually expensive in the long term and fail to live up to expectations. It has been estimated that in the U.S. more than 1,200 septic system additives were available on the market in 2011. Very little peer-reviewed and replicated field research exists regarding the efficacy of these biological septic tank additives.

A properly maintained and installed septic tank has no higher amount of environmental problems than a cities sewage treatment plant., Problems could start with a septic tank in an unsuitable location, and septic tank failures are normally more expensive to fix or replace than city sewer. Since septic systems require large drainfields, they are not good for densely built areas.

In the United States an 2007 American Housing Survey showed that about 20 percent of all homes have septic tanks and that most systems are located in rural (50%) and suburban (47%) areas. Indianapolis is one example of a big city where a lot of the city's neighborhoods still have septic systems at every house.

Youth suicide

When someone who is not yet an adult decides to end his or her own life, this is called youth suicide. In Western societies, there are many people who want to end their lives, and at least try to commit suicide. Suicide is the one of the leading cause of death amongst children, teens and young adults. Suicides attempts are more common among girls than boys. Many girls try, but boys more often succeed in committing suicide. Girls are more likely to use techniques such as overdoses and boys are more likely to try violent means like gunshot or hanging themselves. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the number of youth suicides nearly tripled. In Australia for example, youth suicides are the leading cause of death in young people between 15 and 25. Only traffic accidents cause more deaths. 

In the U.S., according to the National Institute of Mental Health, the suicide rate is the 2nd leading cause of death for adolescents between the ages of 10 and 14, and the third leading cause of death for those between 15 and 19. In 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of ChiId and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the Children's Hospital Association released a joint statement announcing a mental health crisis among our youth. Emergency room visits for mental health issues have dramatically increased, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.

People thinking about suicide don't often tell others about it and there are not always ways to tell if someone if thinking bout killing themselves. Warning signs include: talking about death or about feeling trapped; withdrawing from talking to family, friends and community leaders such as school teachers and health professionals; increasing drug and alcohol use; doing dangerous things; giving away personal possessions; mental health problems such as hearing voices or seeing things that are not really there. Suicide is often lead by a change in mood or starting to self-harm.

Young people in highly developed countries are more likely to kill themselves than in poor or less-economically developed countries. In some cultures suicide is either unknown or mostly unknown. Forest and jungle tribes do not have significant problems with youth suicide and countries with people who are known for general happiness, such as Nepal, have less problems with suicide.

The Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian did a study in 2007. That study found that 39% of the young people committing suicide had lost someone who was important to them. The person they lost had also committed suicide. The commission calls this suicide contagion. It also recommends that young people and communities need to be protected against it. 

Suicide may be linked to many risk factors, including: mental health problems; committing self-harm; pressure from school or university; being bullied; not have lots of friends; poor family environment; pressure to succeed by parents and family deaths; cultural attitudes to suicide; problems with boyfriends or girlfriends; drug abuse; poor physical health or family neglect. The more risk factors a person has or if they go on for a long time add up to a greater chance of suicide.
There are many teenagers who are at risk. One of the problems they have is to get psychiatric counselling when it is needed. A study done in 2020 shows that younger teens more often think that things such as cyberbullying and despair will drive people to commit suicide. One study says, ""In teenagers, depression is considered a major – if not the leading – cause of teen suicide."" Other things that lead young people to commit suicide are academic pressure, drinking alcohol, or losing an important relationship. Changing the place where they live and losing friends when they move or changing places often and not making new friends, and families that are not able to support them also contribute. Harassment or abuse can make a teen commit suicide. Gay teens, and those unsure about their gender are more likley to commit suicide. Many of them have been bullied, harassed or abused. 

People who are part of sexual minorities often suffer from depression. To cope with depression, they often injure and harm themselves. 28% of the people in this group say that they had tried committing suicide, or thought about it. 

Lesbian and gay youth are the group most likely to face negative experiences. According to mental care professionals, they are more likely to develop suicidal thoughts . The same is the case for bisexual people: they are five times more likely to report suicidal thoughts and actions. People who are part of sexual minorities have a problem with drug abuse five times more often than heterosexual people of the same age group. 

Studies also found that these groups can be helped by reducing the bad image that is associated with being part of a sexual minorty. 

Factors such as being exposed to a suicide, having tried suicide in the past, and age impact the probablility of a young person committing suicide. Some researchers have found that someone who has seen a classmate commit suicide. They therefore thought that suicide may be contagious. They note how a child's exposure to suicide predicts ideas about suicide and attempts. A parent trying to commit suicide similarly has an influence: it will increase the chance of the adolescent of thinking about suicide by 3.5%, and the chance of trying to commit suicide by 2.6%. Another cause which can lead youngsters to a suicide attempt is that parents are violent at home. 

Suivcide prevention also focuses on helping those who survived a suicide attempt. Many attempted suicide, because they lost a person they loved or cared for. Helping them with their grief can help them in the long run. Many of them develop depression or anxiety disorders, and suicidal behaviour. 42% of the youth suicides are either because the person committing suicide lost a loved one, or they committed suicide because someone else did, too.

People who have been sexually abused, or who have been faced with physical violence are likely to try to commit suicide. Two things that might affect suicide attempts are lifetime sexual abuse and adult physical violence. Among participants aged 18–25, the odds ratios for lifetime sexual abuse and adult physical violence are 4.27 and 3.85 . In other words, those who died by suicide are 327% more likely to have experienced lifetime sexual assault. Similarly, a suicide victim is 285% more likely to have suffered physical violence as an adult. Based on a survey done on American high school students, 16% reported considering suicide and 8% reported attempting suicide sometime within the year before taking the survey. Between 1980 and 1994, the suicide rates of young black males doubled. American Indians and Alaska Natives die by suicide at a higher rate than any other ethnic group in the United States. In India, one-third of suicides are young people 15–29. In 2002, 154,000 suicides were recorded in India. In the United States, about 60 percent of suicides are carried out with a gun. Some Aboriginal teens and gay or lesbian teens are at high risk, depending on their community and their own self-esteem. Several campaigns have been started to give them hope and help them to feel less isolated.

The 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which was conducted by the CDC, found that between 2009 and 2018, suicide rates among adolescents aged 14-18 years increased by 61.7%. Furthermore, the CDC reported that in 2019, among American adolescents in grades 9 to12:


There are many ways that a person thinking about suicide can get help. Firstly, it is important to talk about their feelings to someone they respect and trust. Just talking to someone else about their feelings can be a great source of help. Encouraging someone to talk to their family doctor or someone at school can be a way of getting help as all doctors and most teachers are trained to help people thinking about suicide. One can help prevent adolescent suicide by discouraging isolation, addressing a child's depression which is correlated with suicide, getting rid of any objects that a child could use to attempt suicide, and simply paying attention to what the child does or feels.
Schools can also help educate people and prevent suicides. At that age, students spend most of their time at school. They either feel comfortable at school, or the school provides triggers for them to commit suicide. Their peer group also inflences how they feel and act. There are also websites either locally in their country or globally that can give advice to people thinking about killing themselves. Some websites are listed below;

IS PATH WARM?

IS PATH WARM? is an acronym used as a mnemonic device. It was created to help counselors and the general public "remember the warning signs of suicide."

Psychiatric literature has mixed reviews of the value of the mnemonic. Several studies have found that some of the warning signs are associated with having thoughts about suicide. A study compared 215 postings on an online "suicide forum" with 94 postings on a "self-injury forum". They found that posters in the 'suicide forum' were more likely than those in the 'self-injury forum' to express thoughts about suicide, purposelessness, feeling trapped, and social withdrawal. The comparison also found that this is not true for recklessness, people in the self-injury forum were more likely to be reckless. The study said that individuals who show "IS PATH WARM" warning signs were more likely to have suicidal ideation.

Psychiatric lierature has also been critical about the value of the mnemonic for predicing suicidal "behavior." A whitepaper done for the United States Fire Service's "Suicide and Depression Summit said that the acronym may not be as useful, because it is not very specific, or sensitive." A 2011 study was also critical of "IS PATH WARM"'s validity, finding that none of the ten warning signs were able to predict completed suicides.

According to a review of school-based suicide prevention, an additional concern is that the IS PATH WARM warning signs were based on risk factors for suicide that appear across the lifespan. There is no independent review for youth suicides. For this reason, the acronym's value in predicting suicidal behavior in children is uncertain.

One of the aims of creating the acronym was to help the general public learn and see the warning signs of suicide. The Society's "IS PATH WARM" webpage explains: "These warning signs were compiled by a task force of expert clinical-researchers and 'translated' for the general public."

"IS PATH WARM?" has widely been used to educate people. It is included in many materials about preventing suicides.Sources include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Suicide Prevention Lifeline; the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention; the New York State Department of Correctional Services Training Academy; and the United States Navy, among many others.

Trial by media

The term "trial by media" gained popularity in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, referring to the influence of television and newspaper coverage on an individual's reputation, creating a widespread perception of guilt or innocence even before a verdict is reached in a court of law. This phenomenon is especially pertinent in cases involving high-profile individuals facing trial, as there is a concern that the impartiality of the jury may be compromised due to the exposure to extraneous information. As a result, the due process of law may be disrupted, leading to the possibility of an unfair trial.

The criminal jurisprudence practiced in India is founded on the principle that an accused person has the right to a fair trial and is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. However, in cases of extensive media coverage, the media often plays a significant role in covering and publishing interviews with witnesses, victim's relatives, and comments from members of the legal community. Unfortunately, this extensive coverage can potentially prejudice the trial proceedings, including the impartiality of the judicial mind.

India, a sovereign nation, stands proudly as a thriving democracy. Its journey towards independence and establishment as a democratic nation was shaped by four fundamental pillars that laid the groundwork for its governance and progress. These pillars are:


The four pillars of democracy in India efficiently carry out their designated roles. Among these pillars, the fourth pillar, the media, plays a crucial role as a bridge between the three branches of government and the common people of society.

An accountable media serves as a supportive ally to effective judicial administration. It goes beyond merely disseminating information about cases and trials; instead, it subjects every aspect of the justice system, including the police, prosecutors, lawyers, judges, and courts, to public scrutiny. Through free and robust reporting, criticism, and open debate, the media contributes to public comprehension of the rule of law and fosters a better understanding of the entire justice system.

As per Choudhary (2015), the term "media trial" or 'Trial by Media' emerged in the early 1980s to describe the influence of media coverage (including print, electronic, and online media) on an ongoing legal trial, shaping public perceptions of right or wrong. It can be seen as a form of public protest through the media.

In simple terms, media trial refers to the impact of television and newspaper coverage on an individual's or an institution's reputation, creating a widespread perception of guilt or innocence even before the court of law reaches a verdict. In certain cases, media trials may continue even after the verdict is announced, especially when the public is dissatisfied with the judgment.

Salon painting

Salon painting is a style of painting that was popular in the 19th century. The name comes from the "Salon carré" of the Louvre, in Paris. This salon is known as Salon de Paris today. Since the time of Louis XV, it was regularly used for art exhibitions. These became known as "salons". In these salons, artworks were shown that the ruling class approved. This means, that very often, it was used for paintings that the rulng class liked.To be able to show paintings there, the artists adapted their painting styles: they made history paintings, and they painted mythological figures, in scenes that wee known from classical stories. This also gave them a pretext to show a lot of naked skin. This was good, because many upper class people had voyeuristic tendencies, and the people also liked to see mostly naked figures in a historical setting.

Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism

Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) is an inherited condition that causes short stature, round face, and short hand bones.[3223][10875] PPHP causes joints and other soft tissues in the body to harden. It also affects how bones are formed.

PPHP is genetically related to pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP-1a). Signs and symptoms are similar, however people with PPHP do not show resistance to parathyroid hormone while people with PHP-1a do. Obesity is characteristic for PHP-1a and may be severe, while obesity is less prominent and may be absent among people with PPHP. Both PHP-1a and PPHP are caused by mutations that affect the function of the "GNAS" gene. But people who inherit the mutation from their "mother" develop PHP-1a; whereas those who inherit the mutation from their "father" develop PPHP.[3223]

Hiranyakashipu

In Hindu mythology, Hiranyakashipu was a powerful demon king who ruled the daityas. He was very angry when his brother Hiranyaksha was killed by Vishnu in his Varaha avatar. So he decided to become invincible by performing a penance to Brahma. Brahma granted Hiranyakashipu a boon that he could not be killed by any man, animal, or weapon. He also could not be killed inside or outside, during the day or night.

Hiranyakashipu became very arrogant and started to terrorize the three worlds (Trailokya). He forced everyone to worship him as the supreme god.Vishnu, who is the preserver of the universe, took pity on the people. He appeared in his Narasimha avatar, which is a half-man, half-lion form. Narasimha killed Hiranyakashipu by tearing him apart with his bare hands.

Genre painting

Genre painting is a style of painting. The painters want to show scenes of everyday life. The people are shown doing things they do in everyday life. Unlike with history paintings, the people cannot be identified, they are anonymous. They migt be identifiable as workers of a certain profession by the way they are dressed, or what they do. Grenre paiting is also called petit genre. History painting also has the name "grand genre".

Vipava (valley)

Augusta Savage

Augusta Savage (1892-1962) was an American sculptor. She made clay sculptures and was involved in the Harlem Renaissance.

Savage was born on February 29, 1892 in Green Cove Springs, Florida. She was the daughter of a Methodist minister. As a young woman she moved to Harlem. In 1921 she began studying art at the Cooper Union School of Art. Her tuition was paid by a scholarship she earned because of her talent. Around that time Savage also won a place in a summer class at the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts in France. She travelled to France but when the teachers at the school saw Savage was black they told her she could not attend.

Savage returned to New York and began creating clay busts of important black people. She made portraits of W. E. B. Du Bois and Marcus Garvey. In 1929 she made a portrait of her nephew and titled it "Gamin". Many people admired this sculpture. It helped her win awards to study in Paris and to travel in Europe.

In 1937 Savage made the sculpture "Lift Every Voice and Sing" for the 1939 New York World's Fair.

In 1938 the Works Progress Administration started the Harlem Community Art Center. Savage was the director.

Savage died on March 26, 1962 in New York City.

Savage was married three times and had one child.

Savage's work is in the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the New-York Historical Society. In 2019 the New-York Historical Society held a retrospective exhibition of her work. It was called "Augusta Savage: Renaissance Woman". It had more than 50 items of her art on display.

Raorchestes glandulosus

The glandular bush frog, Noble's bubble-nest frog, Noble's bush frog, southern bubble-nest frog, rough-skinned bush frog, Manatoddy bubble-nest frog, beautiful bush frog, or pretty bush frog ("Raorchestes glandulosus") is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains. Scientists have seen it between 400 and 2000 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in trees and moves around at night. It lives in the shorter trees in forests. People have seen it about 4 m above the ground. People have also seen it in coffee farms, tea farms, and acacia farms.

The female frog lays eggs on leaves. The eggs hatch into small frogs. These animals never swim as tadpoles.

Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks. Scientists say this frog is at some risk of dying out. Human beings cut down its forests to make large farms, and the chemicals meant to kill pests can kill the frog too. Scientists also think climate change could kill this frog. It could make the frog's home too dry. Also, because the frog lives high in the mountains, it cannot move north if the forest gets too hot. The lower areas between mountains would already be even hotter.

Scientists have seen other frogs in "Raorchestes" sick from the fungus "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis", but they do not know for sure whether that fungus can kill this frog.

Daren Banarsë

Daren Banarsë (aka Troy Banarzi) (born 12 April 1972) is a British-born composer and performer of Irish and Indian descent. He is considered “an experimental music maker with a more art-orientated approach”, creating music with a "folk influence and a fairy-tale quality".

He is a former lecturer at Goldsmiths College, University of London, and has collaborated with, amongst others, the Rambert Dance Company, sound artist Scanner, and composer Kuljit Bhamra. He is also a production music composer, and recording pianist for “De Wolfe Music”, with numerous high-profile television credits including Newsnight, Dispatches, Top Gear, Horizon, The Apprentice, and "Coast" (BBC One).

After training as a pianist at Trinity College of Music, Banarsë taught himself how to compose, and joined DeWolfe Music and the composer rosta of Inter Angel. He has composed music for several television productions, adverts and theatre productions. 

In the early 2000s he began collaborating with experimental artists, writing music for Jonathan Allen’s “performance art” act Tommy Angel at the Hayward Gallery (on the occasion of Eyes, Lies and Illusions), Tate Britain, and the ZOO Art Fair. 

In 2006, he created the audio/visual "performance art" piece, "Euphonika", which explored people's contraversial relationships with dolls and statues. It was scored for string quartet, harp, tuba, Hammond organ, toy piano, melodica, and live electronics, and incorporating video interviews and film animation. Euphonika was subsequently broadcast on Resonance FM and BBC Radio 3. 

"Requiem for the Missing" (2009) was a performance art piece for the East Wing Collection at the Courtauld Institute of Art. It premiered in the courtyard of Somerset House on Friday February 13, with a choir of hooded monks (Trinity College of Music Chamber Choir). It makes use of the following texts: Psalm 88, The 9 Cemetery Contemplations, Pie Jesu, In Paradisum, and 'A Woman Unknown', a 17 century report of a woman found dead in the Thames 

Séance (2009), was a collaboration with sound artist, Scanner (aka Robin Rimbaud). A multi-channel surround sound installation first performed at Somerset House alongside Requiem for the Missing. It combines audio recordings of an historic séance with a contemporary police missing report and recordings of the Thames.

A collaboration with choreographer Patricia Okenwa and the Rambert Dance Company led to a new work, Mammon. It was premiered on 22 May at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, South Bank Centre as part of the Rambert’s “Season of New Choreography” series. The music was scored for string quintet, piano, Hammond organ and drumkit.

After this, Banarsë began to experiment with musical instrument making, creating the Magic Organ (2009), a music/light sculpture exhibited at the East Wing Collection, Courtauld Institute of Art, made from salvaged musical instruments and organ pipes. 

Frustrated with the expressive limitations of the piano, and wanting “to play something that works well with the human body”, Banarsë began exploring the potential of the musical instrument, the melodica, in 2010. After several years of practice he set out to over come the “shrill and inconsistent” tone of the instrument by making his own instruments. He embraced 3D printing technology, combining wood from salvaged pianos to achieve a “high crisp tone similar to that of an accordion” 

He founded the The Melodica World Forum in 2013, and created the first 3D printed melodica in 2015. He currently makes melodica tutorials and performance demonstrations on the YouTube platform.

Banarsë is a regular player on London's Irish folk music scene, where he organises concerts and plays Irish music on melodica. In 2017, he competed at the Feadh Cheoil, an international festival and competition in Ennis, Ireland, winning the All Ireland Silver Medal in the 'Miscellaneous' category. 

In 2017, Banarsë collaborated with a team of researchers at Kingston University and Queen Mary University of London, to explore the potential of artificial intelligence in creating original Irish music. He reported in Vice magazine that there are “no worries about my job (as composer) being replaced in the near future” 

In 2018, as part of the project, he produced a recorded album at Visconti Studio, which included both artificially generated tunes and traditional tunes. It was sent out on white label to specialist music critics in Europe and the USA, under the guise of an album of traditional tunes. The reviews the album received were positive, with one reviewer writing, “[A] fine collection of beautifully-played tunes it is. While it includes some well-known titles such as ‘Lord Mayo’, ‘The Blackbird’ and ‘Toss The Feathers (II)’ … the unnamed jigs, reels and airs here thoroughly deserve their inclusion”.

Javanese calendar

The Javanese calendar is the calendar used by the Javanese people. It is used together with two other calendars, the Gregorian calendar and the Islamic calendar. The Gregorian calendar is the official calendar of the Republic of Indonesia and civil society, while the Islamic calendar is used by Muslims and the Indonesian government for religious worship and deciding connected Islamic holidays.

The Javanese calendar is used by the main ethnicities of Java island—that is, the Javanese, Madurese, and Sundanese people—mainly as a cultural icon and identifier, and as a maintained tradition of antiquity. The Javanese calendar is used for cultural and spiritual purposes.

The epoch of the Javanese Calendar was in the year 125 CE (AD 125).

The current system of the Javanese calendar was started by Sultan Agung of Mataram in the Gregorian year 1633 CE. Before this, the Javanese had used the Śaka calendar, which has its epoch in 78 CE and uses the lunisolar cycle for calculating time. Sultan Agung's calendar kept the Saka calendar year system of counting, but differs by using the same lunar year measurement system as the Islamic calendar, rather than the solar year. Occasionally, the Javanese calendar is referred to by its Latin name Anno Javanico or AJ (Javanese Year).

Boulenger's bubble-nest frog, quartet bush frog, or cross-backed bush frog ("Raorchestes signatus") is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains. Scientists have seen up to 2000 meters above sea level but not higher.

Female reproductive system

The female reproductive system is the internal and external sex organs that work in the production of having children. The female reproductive system is not active at birth. It begins growing at puberty and able to produce ova and to carry a baby to full term. The internal sex organs are the vagina, womb, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The female reproductive tract includes the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes and is prone to infections. The vagina is for sexual intercourse and childbirth. It is connected to the uterus at the cervix. The uterus or womb contains the embryo which develops into the baby. The external sex organs are also known as the "genitals." These are the organs of the vulva: the labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening.

During the woman's menstrual cycle, the ovaries release an ovum. The ovum goes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. If the ovum egg cell meets with sperm on its way to the uterus, it can combine with it, fertilizing it into a zygote.

Fertilization usually happens in the fallopian tubes. This is the beginning of embryogenesis. The fertilized egg will then go through many divisions to form a blastocyst. The blastocyst which sticks itself in the wall of the uterus. This is the start of gestation. The baby will continue to grow until full-term. When the baby has grown enough, the cervix opens and contractions of the uterus propel the newborn through the birth canal (the vagina).

The female external reproductive organs on the outside of the body They are the secondary sex organs.

The vulva is the external parts and tissues and includes the mons pubis, pudendal cleft, labia majora, labia minora, Bartholin's glands, Skene's glands, clitoris, urethra, and vaginal opening.

The female internal reproductive organs are the vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries.

The vagina is a canal leading from the outside of the body to the cervix of the uterus or womb. It is also referred to as the birth canal. The vagina receives the male penis during sexual intercourse. Semen is spermatozoa and is ejaculated from the penis into the vagina.
The cervix is the bottom part of the uterus. This is the lower, narrow portion joining with the upper part of the vagina. It is cylindrical or conical in shape and sticks down through the upper vaginal wall. Approximately half its length is visible. It is the opening where the baby emerges during birth.
The uterus or womb is the major female reproductive organ. The uterus protects the growing baby. It gives nutrition and removes waste products. The contractions of the uterus pushes out the baby at the time of birth.

The uterus is a pear-shaped muscular organ. Its major function is to accept a fertilized ovum which becomes implanted into the lining of the uterus. The baby gets its nourishment from blood vessels of the uterus.
The Fallopian tubes are two tubes leading from the ovaries into the uterus. When the ovary releases an ovum it enters the Fallopian tube. It travels toward the uterus. This trip can take hours or days. When the ovum is fertilized by a sperm cell while in the Fallopian tube, then it normally implants in the womb.

The ovaries are small and located near the side walls of the pelvic cavity. The ovaries produce the egg cells (ova). They also secrete hormones. After the ovary releases an egg cell it travels down the Fallopian tube to the uterus. The egg can then be fertilized by a sperm.

The female reproductive system develops based upon chromosome characteristics at conception. The mother's egg contains an X chromosome and the father's sperm contains either an X or Y chromosome. It is the male who determines the fetus's sex. If the fetus inherits the X chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a female. Testosterone is not made and the fetus develops female sex organs. If the fetus inherits the Y chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a male. The presence of testosterone in the embryo will stimulate the development of the male sex organs.
Vaginitis is an infection of the vagina. It is the most common vaginal condition presented. It is difficult to determine any one organism most responsible for vaginitis. This is because it varies due to age, sexual activity, and method of microbial identification. Vaginitis is not necessarily caused by a sexually transmitted infection. Vaginitis is diagnosed based on the presence of vaginal discharge, which can have a certain color, odor, or quality.

This is a vaginal infection in women. It differs from vaginitis in that there is no inflammation. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by many bacteria species. A bacterial vaginosis infection happens if discharge is thin, the pH of the vigina is 4.5 and the epithelial cells in the vagina have bacteria attached.

This is a common cause of vaginal irritation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 75% of adult women have experienced one yeast infection at least once in their lifetime. Yeast infections are caused by a fungus in the vagina known as Candida. Other things can cause a yeast infection. Pregnancy, diabetes, weakened immune systems, tight fitting clothing, or douching can also be a cause. Symptoms of yeast infection include itching, burning, irritation, and a white cottage-cheese-like discharge from the vagina. A woman may experience painful intercourse and urination. Treatment creams can be applied in or around the vaginal area.

There are many practices of mutilating female genitalia in different cultures. The most common two types of genital mutilation practiced are clitoridectomy, the circumcision of the clitoris and the excision of the prepuce the skin around the clitoris. They can all involve a range of adverse health consequences such as bleeding, irreparable tissue damage, and sepsis.

Genitoplasty refers to surgery that is carried out to repair damaged sex organs. This is done particularly following cancer and its treatment.
There are also elective surgical procedures which change the appearance of the external genitals.

There are many types of birth control available to females. Birth control can be hormonal or physical in nature. However, oral contraceptives can have a variety of side effects, including depression.

Cervical canal

The cervical canal is the flattened canal going through the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus.

The cervical canal is a tube that connects with the uterine cavity through the internal os with the vagina through the external os. The internal os is smaller than the external os. The external os is a small, circular opening on the rounded end of the cervix. The external os opens into the vagina. The cervical cavity is located at the top of the vagina. The external os is surrounded by two lips, an anterior lip and a posterior lip. The anterior lip is shorter and thicker. Both lips are touching the vaginal wall. Before pregnancy, the external os has a rounded shape. After pregnancy the os changes shape. 
The cervical canal is lined by a tissue called the "endocervical mucosa". This consists of a single layer of mucinous columnar epithelium. After menopause the tissue goes through changes.

The endocervical mucosa is one place tissue from where cervical cancer (adenocarcinoma) can grow. Endocervical adenocarcinoma, like another cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma), often grows from human papilloma virus infection.


Marcy Borders

Marcy Borders (July 19, 1973 – August 24, 2015) was an American legal assistant who worked for Bank of America. She is also known as "The Dust Lady". This is because of a picture taken of her by Stan Honda. The picture was of Borders completely covered in dust after surviving the collapse of the World Trade Center in New York City, as part of the September 11 attacks. At the time of the attacks, she was working on the 81st floor of the North Tower.

After the attacks, her personal life and mental health declined. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She had problems with alcohol, broke up with her boyfriend, and lost custody of her children. She said that hearing the news of Osama Bin Laden's death made her start to turn her life around.

Inès de Bourgoing

Inès de Bourgoing (1862-1953) was a French nurse. She was head of the Red Cross in France at the beginning of the 20th century. She went on to develop nursing under the Red Cross approach in Morocco. For her important work, she was names a Grand Officer of the French Legion of Honour.

Inès-Marie de Bourgoing was born into a noble family in Paris on 5 Janaury 1862. She was educated in the city at a school for noble girls. When she was 18, she married Joseph Fortoul, an army officer. The couple had three children but one died before he was two years old. After her husband died from an illness in 1900, she trained in the newly opened school for nurses in Paris.

Shortly after qualifying as a nurse, de Bourgoing joined the SSBM (Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires), an organization for treating injured soldiers which later became the French Red Cross. As a result of her success at the Beaujon Hospital in Paris, she was named head of the SSBM.

In 1907, de Bourgoing went to Morocco with military forces under General Antoine Drude. Heading SSBM volunteers, she opened a treatment centre in Casablanca for soldiers wounded in the fighting between the French and the Moroccans.

Yuri Ryabinkin

Yuri Ivanovich Ryabinkin (Russian: Юрий Иванович Рябинкин; 2 September 1925 – between 8 January and 2 March 1942), was a Russian boy who endured the Siege of Leningrad. He kept a personal diary from 22 June 1941 (the day the Germans invaded the Soviet Union) to 6 January 1942.

He gained posthumous fame a few years later after World War II ended, when his diary was printed by a press. His diary was first published in 1970.

Yuri's fate remains unknown. It is known that he did not survive the siege of Leningrad, and that he died between 8 January and 2 March 1942 (due to records confirming it). The exact date of his death and his burial place, has not been recorded.

Yuri Ivanovich Ryabinkin was born on 2 September 1925 in Saint Petersburg (then Leningrad). His younger sister Irina was born on 30 April 1933. His mother Antonina Mikhailovna Riabinkina (née Pankina), who was born on 13 August 1903, came from a family belonging to the intelligentsia. She finished education at the gymnasium and knew French, German, and Polish, well. Yuri and his family lived in a apartment, which even had a library. By 1941 (when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union), Antonina worked as a librarian and was also a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Yuri's father left the family in April 1933, remarried, and lived with his new wife in a Russian village, near Finland, before being sent to the Gulag, in 1937.

Living with his aunt alone until he was 7, he and his aunt moved in with his mother. In 1933, he began to attend school, and by the age of 15, finished eighth grade. In 1938, whilst sill in school, Yuri began to study the sea in Kuybyshev for one year, and, in 1941, began to study history in the House of Pioneers of Leningrad. Yuri lived with Irina, Antonina, and his aunt in Sadova Street (today named the July 3 street) in Leningrad. When the Ryabinkins learned about the invasion of the Soviet Union, they preferred to stay in Leningrad (because Antonina was a member of the Communist Party). When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union, Yuri suffered from poor eyesight and lung disease, which is why he never made any attempts to join the Red Army. During the siege of Leningrad, in the fall of 1941, his mother Antonina advised him to go to a navy school, so that Yuri could be in better conditions and be evacuated from Leningrad, but Yuri did not pass the test and was rejected from the Navy. 

Yuri began writing a diary on 22 June 1941 (without mentioning why he wanted to keep a diary, at all), without his sister, Irina's knowledge. The only known person to know that Yuri kept a diary, was his mother Antonina. According to his diary, she did not want him to keep a diary.

In a entry dated December 1941, Yuri mentions that he and his family were included in a list of those who will be evacuated from Leningrad, stating that the list showed they will be evacuated somewhere between one day to seven days (one week), but later states that the evacuation was later postponed for almost one month. Sometime later, his mother Antonina recieved a work card, his sister Irina a child card, and Yuri recieved one slice of bread. In the last entry for 1941 dated 24 December, Yuri recalls their life before the war and happiness. 

In the first week of January 1942, Yuri and his family began to suffer from severe stomach disease. The last entry dated 6 January, ends literally in mid-sentence. Two days later on 8 January, the family were put on evacuation, whilst Yuri stayed behind, being gravely ill and weak. Yuri died alone in the family's apartment a few days later from starvation. After traveling for two weeks, the family arrived in Volgoda, where Antonina died the same day they arrived, from exhaustion. Irina, still alive, was sent to a orphanage in the city. On 11 February, Irina was sent to another orphanage in the village of Nikitskaya. She never found out what happened to her brother Yuri, almost all her life. 

Once Irina became a adult, she began searching for her brother Yuri, and asked archivists for records, to discover Yuri's fate.

In February 2021, an archivist found records from the siege of Leningrad indicating that Yuri Ryabinkin died in 1942. Irina was later told of her brother's death.

Sometime in 1942 in Volgoda, a schoolteacher was taken to a hospital, suffering from tuberculosis. There, he gave a nurse named Rebekah Trifonovah in the hospital, a notebook which was Yuri Ryabinkin's diary. The schoolteacher was so weak that he could not talk, and therefore, he did not say where he got the diary. He died a few days later in the hospital.
The nurse published the diary in 1970.

Pace count beads

Pace count beads or ranger beads are a manual counting tool used to keep track of distance travelled through a pace count. It is used in military land navigation or orienteering. A typical example for military use is keeping track of distance travelled during a foot patrol.

The tool is usually constructed using a set of 13 beads on a length of cord. The beads are divided into two sections, separated by a knot. Nine beads are used in the lower section, and four or more beads are used in the upper section. There is often a loop in the upper end, making it possible to attach the tool to the user's gear with a simple Larks head hitch (knot).

The beads can be used to count paces or a distance calculated from the number of paces. Both methods require the user to know the relationship between the paces walked, and the distance travelled. There are two main ways to use the beads. One is to represent the distance a person has walked, and the other is to represent the distance they need to walk. In the latter, beads may be used to count down the distance to a destination.

As users walk, they typically slide one bead on the cord for every ten paces taken. On the tenth pace, the user slides a bead in the lower section towards the knot. After the 90th pace, all nine beads are against the knot. On the 100th pace, all nine beads in the lower section are returned away from the knot, and a bead from the upper section is slid upwards, away from the knot.

In this manner, the user calculates the distance travelled by keeping track of the paces taken. To use this method, the user must know the length of their pace to calculate the distance accurately travelled. Also, the number of paces to be walked must be precalculated (example: 2,112 paces= one mile, based on a 30-inch pace), and then the distance travelled has to be calculated from the walked paces.

For every 100 meters the user walks, one of the lower beads is pulled down. When the ninth of the lower beads is pulled, the user has walked 900 meters. When the user has walked 1000 meters, one of the upper beads is pulled down, and all the lower beads are pulled back up.

Using this method, the user must know the number of paces walked in 100 meters. An experienced user can also adapt the pace count for each hundred meter depending on the terrain. When using this method, the user does not have to calculate distance from the number of paces.

This method can, of course, be used for non-metric distances as well, though with the beads arranged in a different manner.

The Gunhild Cross () is a crucifix from the 12th century. It is made of walrus tusk. It is named for its first owner, Gunhild, a daughter of Svend III of Denmark. It is carved. It has inscriptions both in Latin, and in runes. It is in the collection of the National Museum of Denmark.

The cross was probably created around 1150. There is a Latin inscription, "Liutgerus who carved me at the behest of Helena, who is also called Gunnhildr". After doing some research, Harald Langberg believes that "King Svend" refers to Svend III Grathe, who died in 1157. Before that, people believed it referred to Sweyn II Estridsen. This seems to be the only work of the artist Luitger. 

The cross is first mentioned in 1650. At that time, it belonged to Holger Rosenkrantz' wife, Sophie Axelsdottir Brahe. The Royal Cabinet of Curiosities (Kunskammer) bought it in 1684. In 1945, it was transferred to the National Museum of Denmark.

The cross is carved in two blocks of walrus tusk. It measures . It was originally painted in red, blue and golden colours.

The central Christ figure on the front side is missing. The four cross arms is decorated with carved medallions of female figures, symbolizing "Life" (top), "Death" (bottom), the "victorious church" (left) and the "defeated synagogue" (right). The rear side of the cross is also decorated with carvings. In the centre is a Last Judgement representation of Christ in Majesty. The four medallions show scenes from Heaven (top) and Hell (bottom) as well as the saved (left) and damned souls (right).

The Latin inscriptions are written carved in relatively wide capital letters. Ligatures and abbreviations are used often. The name "Gunhild" is also written in runes on the edge of the bottom medallion. The Latin inscription reads:

Uterine sarcoma

The uterine sarcomas form a group of malignant tumors that grow out from the smooth muscle or connective tissue of the uterus.

Uterine sarcomas and fibroids are alike. Both have an increased uterine size. Abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding happen in both. It can be difficult to tell them apart. Unusual vaginal bleeding may be a sign of uterine sarcoma. Other signs of a uterine sarcoma can be pelvic pain, pressure, and unusual discharge. If a uterus is larger than normal this could also be a sign. There is no special test to detect a uterine sarcoma. A Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer and not designed to detect uterine sarcoma.
MRI is able to find the differences between leiomyomas and uterine sarcomas. Investigations by the physician include imaging (ultrasound, CAT scan, MRI) and, if possible, obtaining a tissue diagnosis by biopsy, hysteroscopy, or D&C. Ultimately the diagnosis is established by the histologic examination of the specimen. Typically malignant lesions have >10 mitosis per high power field. In contrast, a uterine leiomyoma as a benign lesion would have < 5 mitoses per high power field.
Therapy is based on staging and patient condition. Surgery is the mainstay of therapy if feasible involving total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Other approaches include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.

Prognosis is relatively poor.

Uterine sarcoma is rare. Out of all malignancies of the uterine body only about 4% will be uterine sarcomas. Generally, the cause of the lesion is not known, however, patients with a history of pelvic radiation are at higher risk. Most tumors occur after menopause. Women who take long-term tamoxifen are at higher risk.

Al-Hakam II

Al-Hakam II, also known as Abū al-ʿĀṣ al-Mustanṣir bi-Llāh al-Hakam b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān (; 13 January 915 – 16 October 976), was the Caliph of Córdoba. He was the second Umayyad Caliph of Córdoba in Al-Andalus, and son of Abd-al-Rahman III and Murjan. He ruled from 961 to 976. His adopted caliphal title was "Al-Mustanṣir" ().

Al-Hakam II was designated his father's successor as early as 919 at the age of four. During his father's reign, he participated actively in the caliph's administration and gained experience in the palace and on military campaigns. The reign of Al-Hakam II saw the strengthening of the state. He pursued military expansion, both in the north and the south. In North Africa, he competed with the Fatimids for control of the trans-Saharan trade, and subdued the Idrisids of Morocco. In the north, he gained enough esteem of the Christian kings that they regularly solicited his arbitration in their own disputes. During his reign, Al-Andalus was the most powerful state in Europe.

A patron of art and culture, Al-Hakam's library of over 400,000 volumes and forty-four-volume catalogue was one of the largest Islamic collections of the time.
Córdoba, during his reign, became one of the leading centres of Islamic culture. Historians have complemented Al-Hakam II by remarking that his period is the golden age of Al-Andalus for science and knowledge.

Al-Hakam II succeeded to the Caliphate after the death of his father Abd-ar-Rahman III in 961. He secured peace with the Catholic kingdoms of northern Iberia, and made use of the stability to develop agriculture through the construction of irrigation works. Economic development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the building of markets.

Hakam himself was very well versed in numerous sciences. He would have books purchased from Damascus, Baghdad, Constantinople, Cairo, Mecca, Medina, Kufa, and Basra. His status as a patron of knowledge brought him fame across the Muslim world to the point that even books written in Persia, which was under Arab Abbasid control, were dedicated to him. During his reign, a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic. He formed a joint committee of Muwallad Muslims and Mozarab Catholics for this task.

Under Al-Hakam II, promising slave girls were educated according to their aptitudes in calligraphy, astronomy and astrology, medicine, mathematics, and other sciences.

His personal library was of enormous proportions. Some accounts speak of him having more than 600,000 books. The catalogue of library books itself was claimed to be 44 volumes long. Of special importance to Al-Hakam was history, and he himself wrote a history of al-Andalus. Following his death, "Hajib" Almanzor had all "ancient science" books destroyed.
The mathematician Lubna of Córdoba was employed as Al-Hakam's private secretary. She was said to be "thoroughly versed in the exact sciences; her talents were equal to the solution of the most complex geometrical and algebraic problems".

The famous physician, scientist, and surgeon Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) was also active in Al-Hakam's court during his reign, while the leading figures of the Translation movement during the reign of Hakam were Mu'tazilites and Ibn Masarra.

His building works included an expansion of the main mosque of Córdoba (962–966), the Mezquita, and the completion of the royal residence Medina Azahara (976), which his father had begun in 936.

Notable generals who served under Caliph Al-Hakam II were Ghalib ibn Abd al-Rahman and Al-Mansur.

In the early part of his reign, Caliph Al-Hakam II successfully waged war against the Christian kings, Sancho I of León and Castile and García of Navarre. His naval forces defeated Norman sea raiders and seized Tangier from the Idrisids, thereby annexing Morocco to the Caliphate. The Fatimids were defeated in Morocco in 974. The Idrisids were expelled from their territories and Al-Hasan ibn al-Qasim Jannun (the last Idrisid ruler), along with many other Idrisids or their sons, were taken as hostages to Córdoba.

Al-Hakam married Subh of Córdoba, a Basque concubine.

Edward Windsor

Edward Edmund Maximilian George Windsor, Lord Downpatrick (born 2 December 1988), known professionally as Eddy Downpatrick, is a British travel specialist, adventurer, photographer, and writer. He is a co-partner of an expedition and adventure travel company called Wheeler-Windsor Expeditions and the founder of Aristeia Travel, an exclusive travel curator. He has led expeditions to various locations worldwide, including the Himalayas of Nepal - the Himalaya Helicopter Expedition, Central Asia, Scottish Highlands, Norwegian Arctic, Ethiopia, British Columbia, and Balkans. 

In August 2022, Lord Downpatrick was elected as a Member International of The Explorer's Club, a professional society promoting scientific exploration and field study, founded in 1904 in the United States.

Downpatrick is a member of the British Royal Family, and holds the title of Baron (Lord) Downpatrick. He is second-in-line to the Dukedom of Kent, and his grandfather was a first cousin to Queen Elizabeth II. The late Diana, Princess of Wales, was his godmother. A second cousin once removed of Charles III, Downpatrick is the most senior member of the House of Windsor to be excluded from the line of succession to the British throne due his Roman Catholic faith. He, along with his sisters, holds Canadian citizenship through his mother.

Downpatrick was born on 2 December 1988 at St Mary's Hospital, London, and grew up in Cambridge. He is the eldest child of George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews, son and heir apparent of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. He is a member of the British Royal Family and was a first cousin and confidant of the late Queen Elizabeth II. His mother is Sylvana, Countess of St Andrews, who is a Canadian historian with Austro-Italian and French heritage and a fellow of St. John’s College, Cambridge, where she holds the position of Sir Harry Hinsley Lecturer in History. Diana, Princess of Wales, was Downpatrick's godmother, but she died before he got to know her well.

Downpatrick is close to his third cousin Princess Beatrice and to his younger sisters Lady Marina and Lady Amelia Windsor, a fashion model. His great-grandmother Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, was the British royal family's fashion icon in the post-war era.

Downpatrick was educated at Eton College and gained his B.A. and M.A. degrees from Keble College, Oxford, where he studied Modern Languages with a specialisation in French and German. During his time at Oxford, he served as the president of the Bullingdon Club. He wanted to join the British Army after the university, but had not recovered from rugby injuries.

Downpatrick has had a passion for adventure and exploration since his childhood. He has curated, designed, and led private expeditions during his 20s and early 30s, which led to the establishment of his own business, Aristeia Travel in 2021. Later that year, he partnered with Dr. Jack Wheeler to create Wheeler Windsor Expeditions.

Downpatrick, along with Dr Jack Wheeler and independently, designs and guides exclusive expeditions across various regions around the world, including the Scottish Highlands, Ireland, Norway, Saharan, East and sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil, Patagonia, Canada, the Himalayas, Central Asia, and old-world Europe. He is an avid hiker, mountaineer, skier, wild swimmer, linguist, and horseman.

Downpatrick first had the idea to launch a fashion brand while hiking in Scotland in 2009, but decided to first focus on his studies and career as a financial analyst at JP Morgan.

Downpatrick left JP Morgan and began working as a fashion designer in 2016. He was a co-founder and the creative director of the fashion label FIDIR, which he launched in 2017. The brand is a collection of outdoor-wear and accessories. His designs were inspired by the Scottish Highlands.

In 2003, aged 15, following the example of his grandmother the Duchess of Kent and his uncle Lord Nicholas Windsor, Downpatrick, who was baptised in the Church of England, chose to be confirmed into the Catholic Church. He was therefore barred from the line of succession to the British throne according to the Act of Settlement 1701. As a second cousin once removed of King Charles III, Downpatrick is the most senior person excluded from the line of succession for being a Catholic. , he would have been 42nd in line. He remains second in the line of succession, after his father, to the Dukedom of Kent.

Raorchestes chalazodes

The Chalazodes bubble-nest frog, Günther's bush frog, or white-spotted bush frog ("Raorchestes chalazodes") is a frog. Scientists have seen it in one place: Travancore in India. People have seen them between 1200 and 1600 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 23.7 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 26 mm long. The adult frog is green in color with white bumps. The belly is yellow-white with white bumps. Parts of the legs are yellow and green. The iris of the eye is yellow in color with black marks.

This frog lives on bamboo plants in the species group "Ochlandra". These plants grow underneath bigger trees in evergreen forests. The frog can also live on bamboo plants growing next to roads. This frog cannot make holes in the bamboo plant. It must use holes that the Nilgiri palm squirrel ("Funambulus sublineatus") has cut.

Adult male frogs try to get the best bamboo plants to sit on. Then they sing for the adult female frogs. The bamboo plant is a tube with space inside. The female frog goes inside the bamboo plant to lay eggs. She lays 5-8 eggs at a time. Then she goes to another bamboo plant with a different adult male frog and lays more eggs.

The adult male frog is near the eggs until they hatch. He stops animals from eating the eggs. He stops other adult male "R. chalazodes" from eating the eggs. The female frog does not stay near the eggs.

These frogs hatch out of their eggs as small frogs. They are never tadpoles.

There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. This frog is in danger of dying. But human beings change the places where the frog lives by cutting down trees. Humans take the wood from the trees to build things with. They cut the forests to make farms and places for animals to eat grass. Sometimes when humans cut bamboo to use, they take the frogs away with them too. Scientists think the fungus "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis" can also make this frog sick.

Rutka Laskier

Rut Laskier, nicknamed Rutka Laskier (12 June 1929 – December 1943), was a Polish girl of Jewish background, who kept a diary in the Będzin concentration camp, in early 1943.
Rutka Laskier was born Rut Laskier on 12 June 1929 in Kraków, Poland, the eldest of two children. Her mother was a housewife, whilst her father Jakub Laskier, worked as a bank officer.

In late 1939, the Germans invaded Poland. When the Germans eventually reached Kraków, the family escaped to Będzin, a nearby city, from where her father's family originally came from. 
The Germans reached Będzin too, shortly after, and after the Polish surrendered to the Germans, the Germans began occupying the country. A few months later, all the Jews from Będzin were deported to a concentration camp, which was located near the city.

In August 1943, Rutka and her family were deported by train to a extermination camp. Her mother and brother were gassed upon arrival, whilst her father was sent to do forced labor. Rutka was originally believed to have died in the gas chambers with her mother and brother, but when her diary was published, a Holocaust survivor Zofia Minc said that she was friends with a girl named Rutka Laskier in the camp, whom she said came from Będzin. She also said that she was friends with her until she died from a cholera epidemic in the camp in December 1943. She then stated that Rutka was taken to the gas chambers. She then said that Rutka begged her [Zofia] to take her to the electric fence, so she could kill herself. She did so, but an SS guard following them would not allow it. He then grabbed Rutka and took her away. She said that she did not know what happened to Rutka, after that. Zofia assumed that Rutka died the same day she last saw her.
In early 1943, without her family's knowledge, Rutka kept a diary in an exercise book, writing in both ink and pencil. In it, she wrote about witnessing the Nazis persecuting the Jews, her daily life in the Będzin concentration camp, as well as about boys whom she had a crush on. 

The diary begins on 19 January, with the entry "I can not grasp that it is already 1943, four years since this hell began".

According to her diary, she used to believe in God, but became a atheist when the Nazis began persecuting the Jews in Poland.

The diary ends three months later on 24 April 1943, with Rutka noting how beautiful and sunny the weather looked outside of her house.

Raorchestes beddomii

Beddome's bush frog or Beddomme's bubble-nest frog ("Raorchestes beddomii") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat Mountains, between 1200 and 1780 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in trees and bushes. People have seen it on the lower plants in tropical forests and evergreen forests. It lives in places where the tree branches do not come together like a roof all the way. This frog can live near human beings.

The frogs that live in the very southern part of this frog's home have red eyes. Frogs that live further north do not.

Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because even though it does not live in a large place, people are only changing small parts of that place, and the frog is good at living in places that humans have changed.

Hypomania

Hypomania is a condition similar to mania but less severe. The symptoms are similar with elevated mood, increased activity, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, racing thoughts, and the like. However, hypomanic episodes differ in that they do not cause significant distress or impair one's work, family, or social life in an obvious way while manic episodes do.

Hypomanic people tend to be unusually cheerful, have more than ample energy, and need little sleep. Hypomania is a pleasurable state. It may confer a heightened sense of creativity and power. However, hypomania can subtly impair a person's judgment. Too much confidence can hide the consequences of decisions.

Hypomania can be difficult to diagnose because it may seem like mere happiness. It is important to diagnose hypomania because, as an expression of bipolar disorder, it can cycle into depression and carry an increased risk of suicide.

Hypomania has a reputation for being difficult to treat. There are anti-psychotics and anti-manic drugs, but above all, a person who shows these symptoms needs specialist attention.

The yellow-bellied bush frog or Malabar bubble-nest frog ("Raorchestes flaviventris") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat Mountains, between 1249 and 1900 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in forests with evergreen trees. It lives 2-4 meters over the ground. People have also seen it in cardamom farms but only at the edges, and only in farms near forests. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole.

Scientists think this frog is in some danger of dying out because it does not live in many places, and human beings still cut down trees there. Scientists think there are five or six groups of this frog. Two of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Eravikulam National Park and Anamalai Tiger Reserve.

Tupi language

The Tupí Language was the language spoken by the indigenous Tupí People of Brazil. It was related to Guarani. When Portuguese colonizers first came to Brazil, many of the first people they met spoke Tupí. The Portuguese learned the language so that they could talk to the Tupí and convert them to Christianity. Tupí became a lingua franca of Brazil for many years. Its use was encouraged by Jesuit missionaries.

In 1759, the Prime Minister of Brazil forced the Jesuits to leave. More Portuguese settlers that did not speak Tupí moved to Brazil around the same time. These things made most Brazilians want to speak Portuguese instead of Tupí. While Old Tupí is no longer spoken, the Nheengatu language is descended from it.

Journey to the Center of the Earth

Journey to the Center of the Earth (), also known as A Journey to the Centre of the Earth and A Journey into the Interior of the Earth, is a science fiction book by Jules Verne. It was first published in French in 1864, then reissued in 1867 in an expanded version. The book is about Professor Otto Lidenbrock, an eccentric German scientist who believes there are volcanic tubes that reach to the very center of the earth. He, his nephew Axel, and their Icelandic guide Hans rappel into an inactive volcano in Iceland. They then deal with many dangers, including cave-ins, tornadoes, an underground ocean, and living prehistoric creatures from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. The three explorers are eventually sent back to the surface by an active volcano located in southern Italy.

Subterranean fiction existed before Verne. However his book was different because of its well-researched Victorian science and its innovation to the science fiction subgenre of time travel. Verne's innovation was the concept of a prehistoric area still existing in the present-day world. The book was made into a movie in 1959. It inspired many other books, including J. R. R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit".

Cneoridium dumosum (Nuttall) Hooker F. Collected March 26, 1960, at an Elevation of about 1450 Meters on Cerro Quemazón, 15 Miles South of Bahía de Los Angeles, Baja California, México, Apparently for a Southeastward Range Extension of Some 140 Miles

""Cneoridium dumosum" (Nuttall) Hooker F. Collected March 26, 1960, at an Elevation of about 1450 Meters on Cerro Quemazón, 15 Miles South of Bahía de Los Angeles, Baja California, México, Apparently for a Southeastward Range Extension of Some 140 Miles" is a humorous, but factual, scientific paper. It was written by American botanist Reid Moran who was from the San Diego National History Museum.

The paper is about a plant species called "Cneoridium dumosum".

Because of its long title, which has all of Moran's key points, and its many acknowledgements, the paper only contains the words:

which only has five words, the reference number of the specimen collected (inside parentheses), and a period.

Moran's closing acknowledgement contains the text:

which was also used by biologist George Yatskievych in 1982.

In an obituary to Moran, published by "The San Diego Union-Tribune", another botanist Tom Oberbauer said that Moran "had a dry sense of humor".

The paper was published in 1962. It was published in volume 16, page 272 of the California Botanical Society's scientific journal called "Madroño". The whole paper was later published again, in 2013, with the title "Reprinted Classic Madroño Articles" in "Madroño", volume 60, page 359. This was the California Botanical Society's centennial (100th) year.

This paper is not the shortest paper ever published. A 2003 paper written by John H. Conway and Alexander Soifer has the title "Can "n"+ 1 unit equilateral triangles cover an equilateral triangle of side > "n", say "n" + "ε"?". The paper only has two words: ""n"+2 can", and two figures. An even shorter paper is titled "Chemiefreie Haushaltsprodukte" (which is German for "Chemical-free household products). It has zero words after the abstract.

A lot of energy is required to break up stones. The treatment usually makes the person hurt (feel sore or bruised) for at least several days. Sometimes it causes bleeding inside the body. 

The word lithotripsy is made up from two Greek words meaning "breaking stones". Lithotripsy can also be done on animals other than people.

There are several different types of lithotripsy. Some or all them cannot be done for some people, depending on their state of health. Some of the conditions in which shock wave lithotripsy must not be used include: pregnancy, severe untreated hypertension (high blood pressure), bleeding disorders (the person doesn't stop bleeding if cut) or use of blood thinners, untreated urinary tract infections and aortic aneurysms (which are bulges in, or ballooning of, the main artery from the heart).

Galactic habitable zone

Galactic habitable zone is a habitable zone in astronomy and astrobiology, where life is most likely to occur in any galaxy. The concept of a habitable zone uses many things, like metalicity, presence of chemicals that life requires, and uses these to find out which regions of a galaxy are more likely to form rocky planets, that can develop simple life, and provide a suitable environment for this life to evolve and grow. According to research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may favor the development of habitable planets more than small galaxies like the Milky Way.

Travel clock

A travel clock, travel alarm clock and in some cases pouch alarm clock, is an alarm clock whose primary characteristic is that it must have a dimension, design and weight, that make it easily transportable during a trip, so it is usually contained in a box or case. In the case of an alarm clock, the box must let the acoustic signal pass through in order to wake up from sleep at the set time or remember a specific date.

For a long time, watches were luxury items. For the majority of the population, sleep ended when it got light or when the rooster crowed. The few who had to rise before dawn were awakened by the night watchman. However, watches with an additional alarm function have been around for as long as classic watches, that is, since the 14th century. . In Dante's masterpiece, his Divine Comedy of 1320, there is a very precise description of a clock equipped with a bell mechanism. 

Descriptions of water clocks have been preserved from antiquity, where the water level in a vessel indicated the time. Most had floats inserted, which activated bells or figures through a lever when it reached a certain level of filling. In 12th-century monasteries, alarm clocks with bell signals reminded people to observe prayer times. However, these "clocks" have not survived to this day, except in the form of manuscripts. 

With the invention of portable clocks in the 16th century, the travel alarm clock became mobile thanks to the spring as an energy accumulator and the steering wheel . In the 1920s, travel alarm clocks were mass-produced with increasing mobility. At first resembling the travel alarm clocks of earlier eras, they were covered in an elegant case that protected the watch while traveling. At night the watch was taken out of its protective case and placed on the bedside table. Later, the machinery was permanently attached by a hinge to the pouch-like sheath. So the case not only protected the alarm clock, but was also its support.

Bobi (dog)

Bobi (11 May 1992 – 21 October 2023) was a male purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo dog cared for by Leonel Costa of Conqueiros Leiria, Portugal. On 2 February 2023, Bobi was confirmed as the first dog on record to live to the age of 30, along with being the oldest dog on record to ever live. On 11 May 2023, Bobi turned 31.

Bobi's age has been validated by the Portuguese government's pet database and certified by "Guinness World Records".

Bobi was born as one of four male puppies in an outbuilding where his caretaker's family stored wood. His brothers were all buried alive after birth due to Costa's father not wanting to take care of more animals. Since Bobi blended in with the wood at birth, Costa's father did not see him when he was collecting the puppies to bury.

According to "Guinness World Records," Bobi is the oldest verified living dog as well as the oldest verified dog in history, being 30 years 266 days old as of evaluation on 1 February 2023, surpassing the previous record held by Bluey, a female Australian Cattle Dog from Victoria, Australia, aged 29 years and 5 months, which had been the record for over 83 years.

The owners have stated that Bobi is in reasonably good health for his age, although he has trouble walking and possesses poor eyesight. Overall, he has had a good run of health, despite collapsing due to breathing difficulties in 2018. The Costas attributed Bobi's longevity to a "calm, peaceful environment" and consumption of fresh food rather than conventional kibble. His longevity could also be attributed to his genetics, as Bobi's mother lived to 18 years.

In honor of Bobi's 31st birthday, 100 guests were invited to celebrate the occasion which was marked by eating meat and fish with a performance by a troupe of dancers.

Bobi died on 21 October 2023, in Conqueiros, Leiria, Portugal, aged 31.

Chedi Kingdom

Chedi () was an ancient Indian mahajanapada, a kingdom which fell roughly in the Bundelkhand division of Madhya Pradesh regions to the south of river Yamuna along the river Ken. Its capital city was called Suktimati in Sanskrit and Sotthivati-nagara in Pali. In Pali-language Buddhist texts, it is listed as one of the sixteen mahajanapadas ("great realms" of northern and central India). Ishwarsena alias "Mahaksatrapa" Isvardatta, the founder of the Abhira dynasty, who seemed to have ruled over a large territory in the Deccan, started an era to commemorate his ascension, which became known as the Kalachuri-Chedi era.

According to the Mahabharata, the Chedi Kingdom was ruled by Shishupala, an ally of Jarasandha of Magadha and Duryodhana of Kuru. He was a rival of Vasudeva Krishna who was his uncle's son. He was killed by Vasudeva Krishna during the Rajasuya sacrifice of the Pandava king Yudhishthira. Bhima's wife was from Chedi. Prominent Chedis during the Kurukshetra War included Damaghosha, Shishupala, Dhrishtaketu, Suketu, Sarabha, Bhima's wife, Nakula's wife Karenumati, Dhrishtaketu's sons. Other Chedis included King Uparichara Vasu, his children, King Suvahu, King Sahaja. It was ruled during early periods by "Paurava" kings and later by Yadava kings in the central part of the country.

The location of the capital city, Suktimati, has not been established with certainty. Historian Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri and F. E. Pargiter believed that it was in the vicinity of Banda, Uttar Pradesh. Archaeologist Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti has proposed that Suktimati can be identified as the ruins of a large early historical city, at a place with the modern-day name Itaha, on the outskirts of Rewa, Madhya Pradesh.

The Chedi clan and kingdom was founded by Chidi, the son of Vidarbha and belonging to the Yadava dynasty. Chedi was later conquered and ruled by the Pururava King Vasu Uparichara, upon the order of Indra. Uparichara's descendant is Shishupala.

The Kuru-Panchalas, the Salwas, the Madreyas, the Jangalas, the Surasenas, the Kalingas, the Vodhas, the Mallas, the Matsyas, the Sauvalyas, the Kuntalas, the Kasi-Kosalas, the Chedis, the Karushas, the Bhojas...(6,9)

"Chedi was one among the kingdoms chosen for spending the 13th year of exile by the Pandavas."

Surrounding the kingdom of the Kurus, are, many countries beautiful and abounding in corn, such as Panchala, Chedi, Matsya, Surasena, Pattachchara, Dasarna, Navarashtra, Malla, Salva, Yugandhara, Saurashtra, Avanti, and the spacious Kuntirashtra. (4,1)

Uparichara Vasu was a king of Chedi belonging to the Puru Dynasty. He was known as the friend of Indra. During his reign, Chedi kingdom had a good economic system and contained much mineral wealth, which made a lot of merchants around the world, come to the Kingdom. It was abundant in animals and corn. There were many towns and cities in the kingdom. He possessed a very special chariot. He introduced a festival in his kingdom in the honour of Indra. The festival involved planting of a bamboo pole every year, in honour of Indra. The king will then pray for the expansion of his cities and kingdom. After erecting the pole, people decked it with golden cloth and scents and garlands and various ornaments. From Chedi, he ruled a large territory, placing his sons as governors of various provinces. His son Vrihadratha (Maharatha) was installed in Magadha, who later fathered Emperor Jarasandha. His other sons, viz., Pratyagraha, Kusamva (Manivahana), Mavella and Yadu also became governors at various places. Thus the Chedi king attained the status of an emperor and his kingdom became a vast empire. He diverted the waters of river Suktimati from the locks of the Mountain Kolahala, for irrigating his capital-city which he named Suktimati. (1,63)


His wife Girika, was from the valley of Kolahala. Girika's brother was installed as the generalissimo of Vasu's army. Apart from his five royal sons, he had a son and a daughter born of a woman of fisherman community. The male child, in due course established the Matsya Kingdom and founded the royal dynasty called "Matsya Dynasty". The female child lived as a member of fishermen community. Her line established as fishermen on the banks of river Yamuna, in the kingdom of Kurus. The famous Kuru king Santanu's wife Satyavati was from this fishermen community. The author of Mahābhārata, vis Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa and the Kuru kings viz Chitrangada and Vichitravirya were the sons of Satyavati. Pandavas and Kauravas were the grandsons of Vichitravirya.(1,63)


Shishupala was the malevolent son of the King Damaghosha (1,189). He had another name viz Sunitha. His mother was Shrutakirti, who was the sister of Kunti, the mother of Pandavas. Both Kunti and Shrutakirti were sisters of Vasudeva the father of Vasudeva Krishna. However Shishupala developed enmity with Krishna (2,44), though he was affectionate to the Pandava Bhima. During his military campaign to collect tribute for Pandava king Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice, Bhima stayed at the palace of Shishupala for a month as a guest. He also accepted Yudhishthira's sway over his kingdom and gave Bhima tribute (2,28). During the midst of Yudhishthira's Rajasuya ceremony, a dispute arose between Shishupala and Vasudeva Krishna. Pandavas tried to mediate. He also rebuked the Pandavas and Kuru grandsire Bhishma along with Krishna. Then Krishna, extremely provoked, decapitated Shishupala. (2,44).

Shishupala's hostilities to Krishna were many. He burned the city of Dwaraka, while Krishna was in Pragjyotisha with his army. He attacked king Bhoja, sporting at Raivataka hill close to Dwaraka. He stole the horse of Krishna's father Prince Vasudeva of Mathura, during his horse-sacrifice. He insulted the wife of Akrura (Vabhru – the friend of Krishna), on her way from Dwaraka to Sauvira Kingdom. He kidnapped the princess of Visala, viz Bhadra, the fiancé of Karusha king. (2,44)


Dhrishtaketu, the king of Chedi (3,12), was described as the elder son of King Shishupala (5,50). During the time of Dhrishtaketu too, Suktimati was the capital of Chedi. Dhrishtaketu was an army-general in the army of Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War. He was the leader of the army of the Chedis, the Kasis, and the Karushas (5,199). He was a Maharatha (a great chariot-warrior) as per the rating of Bhishma (5,172). One of his sons also took part in the war (5,57). He was slain by Drona (7,128), (11,25). Dhrishtaketu was also slain in battle by Drona.



King of Chedi Kingdom, Dhrishtaketu, the son of Shishupala (who was killed by Krishna on the day of Yudhishthira's Rajasuya Yagna) and his sons (at least 3) took part in the Kurukshetra War from the Pandavas' side. Dhrishtaketu was killed by Guru Dronacharya on the 14th day of the war. Prince of Chedi kingdom (Son of Dhrishaketu) was killed by Ashwatthama on the 15th day of the war.


In the 2012 anthropological thriller The Krishna Key, the origin of Chedi clan has been linked to the Yadavas. Dr. Devendra Chedi is one of the main characters of the novel who is the genetic expert.

Family Association Gräff-Graeff

The Family Association Gräff-Graeff () is an organization for descendants of the (De) Graeff families, including the Dutch De Graeff line, alleged descendants of Austrian noble Wolfgang von Graben († 1521) from the dynastic Von Graben family. It was created in 2013 and officially registered in Austria.

The idea for the creation of a Family Association was thought up by the cousins Senator Andreas Gräff, Doris Bogner-Gräff and Matthias Laurenz Gräff, members of an extramarital branch of the Dutch (De) Graeff family now located in Austria, in order to strengthen the links between the family lines. Following a family reunion in 2013, the founders then wrote to all the Graeffs inside and outside Austria who had been in communication with their immediate family and it was agreed that a Family Association should be created. In the same year the Gräff-Graeff Family Association was officially formed with Matthias Laurenz Gräff as chairman and Rudolf Gräff jr as vice chairman.

The chairmanship and administration of the Family Association must not be confused with the function of a head of the whole family and their different branches. The Association also offers associate Memberships to the partners, children and grandchildren of Graeff members, as well as members of the family of Orsini-Rosenberg, who share the same ancestors as the Graeff family, the Von Graben. 2014 the Association founded branches in The Netherlands and South Africa with official representatives. That same year, members and representatives of the US-families Updegraff and Updegrove were also admitted as associate members into the Family Association. They are descendants from the originally Dutch-German Op den Graeff family, which according to their family tradition also descended from Wolfgang von Graben. The official statement of the family association on the Op den Graeff family states: "The origin of the originally german or dutch Op den Graeff family from the von Graben family cannot be proven, since no source is given. This theory is only maintained by their descendants." The Association has around 150 members. In 2014, on the occasion of 530 years of family Graeff, a reunion took place at Schloss Kornberg in Styria, Austria, the former seat of Wolfgang von Graben. In 2022, Karl von Habsburg, head of the Habsburg-Lorraine family, the former Roman-German and Austrian imperial family, attended a presentation of the family flag with the dates of the anniversary.

Abhira dynasty

The Abhira dynasty was a dynasty that ruled over the western Deccan, where they maybe succeeded the Satavahanas. From 203 to roughly 260, they formed a vast kingdom. Abhira Era started by Ishwarsena in AD 249, continued with them and was called Abhira-Traikutika era. This era was later continued by Kalachuri Dynasty, calling it Kalachuri era, and later Kalachuri-Chedi era. After the rule of five Traikuta kings, they retired to central provinces and assumed the name Haihaya and Kalachuri. Historians call this entire era as Abhira-Traikutika-Kalachuri-Chedi era. In the Ramayana and Mahabharata the Abhiras in the West are spoken of, and in the Puranic Geographie, the country on the western coast of India from the Tapti to Devagarh, is called Abhira or the region of cowherds. It seems probable that they were connected with the Yadavas who were in power in the eighth, and again appear as the rulers of Devagiri or Daulatabad in the 12th and 13th century.

According to sociologist M. S. A. Rao, The Abhiras are equated with Ahirs, Gopas and Gollas, and all of them are considered Yadavas.

The Bhāgavata calls the Abhiras as Saurastra and Avantyas rulers (Sauraṣṭra-āvanty ābhirāḥ) and the Vişņu treats the Abhiras as occupying the Surastra and Avanti Provinces. The Abhiras have been well-known since epic times as a martial tribe.

According to the Mahabharata, the Abhiras lived near the seashore and on the bank of the Sarashvati, a river near Somnath in Gujarat.

Accoording to some authors, the origin of the Abhiras is steeped in obscurity. Though, we often come across references about them in Ancient Indian literature, hardly any of them throw light on the problem of their origin. The Mahābhashya of Patañjali simply mentions them as a caste/tribe distinct than the Sudras.

Some sources state that Abhiras are Kshatriyas and specifically Yaduvanshi.

They were among the successors of the Satavahanas in the Western Deccan. Some of them entered the military service of the Western Satraps (Sakas), and helped them in conquest of new territories. By 181 A.D, the Abhiras had gained considerable influence at the Kshatrapa court. Some of them were even serving as generals.

The Gunda inscription dated Saka year 103 (181 CE) refers to Abhira Rudrabhuti as the "senapati" (commander-in-chief) of the Saka satrap (ruler) Rudrasimha. The inscription also gives a detailed genealogy of the kings up to Rudrasimha:

The inscription refers Rudrasimha to as simply a "ksatrapa", ignoring the existence of any "mahaksatrapa". According to Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya, this indicates that the Abhira general was the "de facto" ruler of the state, though not assuming any higher title. The inscription states Abhira Rudrabhuti as the son of the general Bapaka. The Abhira dynasty was probably related Abhira Rudrabhuti.

The history of the Abhiras is shrouded in much obscurity. The Abhira dynasty was founded by Ishwarsena. The branch came to power after the demise of the Satavahanas in the Nasik region of Maharashtra, with the help and consent of the Western Satraps (Sakas). They were known as "Gavali rajas" indicating that they were cowherds by profession before becoming kings. Ten Abhira kings ruled in the Maharashtra region of the Deccan, whose names have not been mentioned in the Puranas.
An Abhira king is known to have sent an embassy to the Sassanid "Shahanshah" of Persia, Narseh, to congratulate him on his victory against Bahram III.

During the time of the Gupta Empire, the Indian emperor Samudragupta recorded Abhira as a "frontier kingdom" which paid an annual tribute. This was recorded by Samudragupta's Allahabad Pillar inscription, which states the following in lines 22–23.

The duration of the Abhira rule is uncertain, with most of the Puranas giving it as sixty-seven years, while the Vayu Purana gives it as one hundred and sixty-seven years. According to V.V Mirashi, the following were the feudatories of the Abhiras- 

The Abhiras spoke Apabhraṃśa, and seem to have patronized Sanskrit. The Nasik cave inscription of Isvarsena is written mostly in Sanskrit. Several guilds flourished in their kingdom, in which people invested large amounts for making endowments. This indicates peace, order and security in the kingdom of the Abhiras.

According to Dr. Bhagwan Lal, The Abhira or Ahir King Ishvardatta entered Gujarat from North Konkan defeated Vijayasena, a Kshatriya and established his supremacy.

Patanjali in his Mahabhashya mentioned about Abhira kings. Abhira chieftains served as Generals to the Saka rulers. In the second century A.D., an Ahir Chief Isvaradatta became the "Mahakshatrapa"(Supreme King). The Abhira played a key role in causing downfall of Satvahanas in third century A.D.

Another king claiming to be a son of Mathari besides Abhira Ishwarsena is Sakasena. He is identified with Saka Satakarni, whose coins have been found over Andhra Pradesh and is taken to be a Satavahana king and successor of Yajna Sri Satakarni. However, K.Gopalchari thinks that Sakasena was a Abhira king. Reasons:

So this concludes that Ishwarsena's predecessor was his elder brother Sakasena, and Ishwarsena ascended the throne after his death.

Sakasena was probably the first great Abhira king. His inscriptions from the Konkan and coins from Andhra Pradesh suggest that he ruled over a large portion of the Satavahana Empire.

Ishwarsena was the first independent Abhira king. He was the son of Abhira Sivadatta and his wife Mathari. Ashvini Agrawal thinks he was a general in the service of Rudrasimha I who deposed his master in 188 A.D and ascended the throne. Ashvini Agrawal further says that Rudrasimha I soon deposed him and regained the throne in 190 A.D. He (Ishwarsena) started an era which later became known as the Kalachuri-Chedi era. His descendants ruled for nine generations. Ishwarsena's coins are dated only in the first and second years of his reign and are found in Saurashtra and Southern Rajputana.

The Traikuta rule of Aparanta or Konkan begins in A.D. 248 (Traikuta era) exactly the time of Ishwarsena's rule, hence Traikutas are identified with the Abhira dynasty.

The Abhiras began to rule in Southern and western Sourashtra from the second half of the 10th century A.D their capital was vamanshtali, modern vanthali nine miles west of Junagadh. They became very powerful during the reign of Graharipu who defeated the Saindhavas and the Chaulukyas.

is evident from the epigraphical records of the Yadavas of Devagiri and the Hoysalas that the Abhiras were called Ahuras and Gualas in the 13th century. This proves that the Abhiras, Gopas and Ghoshas were not different people.

The following is the list of the sovereign and strong Abhira rulers-

The Abhiras ruled western Maharashtra which included Nasik and its adjoining areas, Aparanta, Lata, Ashmaka, and Khandesh Their core territory included Nasik and the adjoining areas. The Abhira territory also may have consisted of Malwa, which they gradually seized from the Kshahratas.

After the death of Abhira Vashishthiputra Vasusena, the Abhiras probably lost their sovereign and paramount status. The Abhiras lost most of their domains to the rising Vakatakas (north) and the Kadambas (south-west). The Abhiras were finally supplanted by their feudatories, the Traikutakas. But still many petty Abhira chieftains and kings continued to rule until the fourth century, roughly till 370 AD, in the Vidarbha and Khandesh region. They continued to rule, but without sovereignty, until they came into conflict with the Kadamba king Mayurasarman and were defeated.

The descendants of the Abhiras can be recognized by their surnames, such as "Ahir, Ahire, Ahir-Rao" etc. These surnames are commonly found in Khandesh and Western Maharashtra.
According to Ganga Ram Garg, the modern-day Ahir caste are descendants of Abhira people and the term "Ahir" is the Prakrit form of the Sanskrit term "Abhira". This view gets support in many writings.

Prittlewell is part of the inner city of Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England. It was the original settlement, with Southend meaning the southern end of Prittlewell.

People first settled by the Prittle Brook at least 10,000 years ago in the late Stone Age. 
A Roman farmhouse or villa, was built close to the brook in what is now Priory Park. Roman burial sites were found during road and rail construction in the 1920s and 1930s.

After the Roman era, it became part of the kingdom of the East Saxons. During the 5th and 6th centuries), the historic Saxon name of "Prittleuuella" came into being. An archway built of Roman tiles can still be seen in the north wall of St Mary's church. For many years it was thought the archway was part of a small Anglo-Saxon chapel built in the 7th century, possibly during the reign of King Sæberht of Essex. However, more recent research shows the arch was built in the 10th or early 11th century, and is part of the first church to be built on the site.

Road and rail works in 1923 and 1930 also found Anglo-Saxon burials. Some of these must have been important people or warriors. The graves contained weapons, imported goods, jewellery and decorative beads, some of which were made out of glass. In 2003 a large and undisturbed 7th-century chamber tomb was found by archaeologists from Museum of London Archaeology. They were exploring the site for a new road widening project. In 2009, following local opposition, the project was stopped, and other roads were changed instead.

The unusually rich contents and their condition have excited archaeologists, being described as "unique" by the Museum of London. A description of the excavation and the artefacts of the burial chamber, originally thought to be of Sæberht of Essex, can be seen at the dedicated Museum of London website. The story was also made into a TV show, a special documentary called the "King of Bling", as part of the "Time Team" series.

Dave Matthews Band Chicago River incident

On August 8, 2004, a Dave Matthews Band tour bus dropped about of human waste from the bus's blackwater tank through the Kinzie Street Bridge in Chicago onto a passenger sightseeing boat sailing in the Chicago River below.

As part of a 2005 legal settlement, the band agreed to pay $200,000 to environmental protection and other projects. The band also donated $100,000 to two groups that protect the river and the surrounding area. The band's bus driver, Stefan Wohl, pleaded guilty to dumping the waste in April 2005.

On August 8, 2004, at 1:18 p.m., Stefan Wohl, the band's tour bus driver, was alone in the bus and driving to a downtown hotel. He then emptied the bus' blackwater tank as it crossed the metal grates of the Kinzie Street bridge.

According to Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, passengers on the boat included persons with disabilities, elderly, a pregnant woman, a small child, and an infant. She described the incident:

In March 2005, Wohl pleaded guilty to reckless conduct and discharging contaminants to cause water pollution. The Dave Matthews Band did not immediately apologize after supporting Wohl. He was sentenced to 150 hours of community service, fined $10,000 to be paid to Friends of the Chicago River, an environmental organization, and received 18 months probation. The Dave Matthews Band donated $50,000 to the Chicago Park District, $50,000 to Friends of the Chicago River, and paid the State of Illinois $200,000 in settlement.

Constitutional court

A constitutional court is a high court that deals primarily with constitutional law. Its main authority is to rule on whether laws that are challenged violted with constitutionally established rules.

Prior to 1919, the United States, Canada and Australia had adopted the concept of judicial review by their courts, following shared principles of their similar common law legal system. 

In 1919 the First Austrian Republic established the first dedicated constitutional court, the Constitutional Court of Austria, which however existed in name only until 10 October 1920, when the country's new constitution came into effect, upon which the court gained the power to review the laws of Austria's federal states. The 1920 Constitution of Czechoslovakia, which came into effect on 2 February 1920, was the first to provide for a dedicated court for judicial review of parliamentary laws, but the court did not convene until November 1921. Subsequently, this idea of having a separate special constitutional court that only heard cases concerning the constitutionality of the national legislature's acts got adopted by many other countries such as Greece (1927), Spain (1931) and Germany (1949).

The list below consists countries with separate constitutional courts. Yet some other countries do not have separate constitutional courts, but instead delegate constitutional judicial authority to their ordinary court system, with the final decision-making power resting in the supreme court. Nonetheless, such courts are sometimes also called "constitutional courts". For example, the Supreme Court of the United States has been called the world's oldest constitutional court because it was one of the earliest courts in the world to strike down a law as unconstitutional ("Marbury v. Madison"), even though it is not a separate constitutional court.

Death of Cleopatra

The death of Queen Cleopatra VII, on August 10 or 12, 30 BC, in Alexandria Governorate. Queen Cleopatra was 39 years old. But Queen Cleopatra committed suicide, as the Greek and Roman historians said, she ended herself or named the same Cleopatra herself by means of toxic bandages.
Where these ancient Roman poets said, Aestrabo, Plutarch, and Cassius Dio. Archaeological stories about the chances of snakes and scorpions causing a person's immediate death are a matter of debate among modern scholars. Some scholars have advanced the hypothesis that Octavian, the founder of a cult of three to Cleopatra, had forced her to commit suicide by choosing her. Of the archaeological records, Octavian allowed Cleopatra's body to be buried in a grave that no one knew until now, and it was not mentioned in any book, and her husband, Mark Anthony, was willing to do so.

De Graeff

De Graeff, also known as "Graeff" ("De Graef, Graef", but also "Graaff") and "De Graeff van Polsbroek", is the name of a Dutch patrician and aristocratic family that still exists today. The family peaked in Amsterdam and Holland in the 17th century, the Dutch Golden Age. Due clever tactics they become one of the most influential families in the Dutch Republic.

The wealth of the De Graeffs was based on commercial transactions and their marriage policy. In terms of their political commitment, they belonged to the Republican faction and were critica against the House of Orange. They were connected to the Bicker family through numerous marriage alliances. During the Golden Age, members of the De Graeff family were also important patrons of art.

The family lives in The Netherlands, South Africa and the German-speaking countries. In 1885 the Dutch main line was introduced in the new Dutch nobility. In 2013 the worldwide Family Association Gräff-Graeff (Familienverband Gräff-Graeff e.V.) was founded for the claimed Graeff lineage of Wolfgang von Graben. The chairmanship and administration of the Family Association must not be confused with the function of a head of the whole family and their different branches.

Connecticut Shotgun

Connecticut Shotgun Manufacturing Co. is an American company that makes guns. It was started in 1975 by Antony S. Galazan in New Britain, Connecticut. At first, the company made small parts for guns. But now, it's known for making expensive and high-quality shotguns.

In 1975, Antony S. Galazan started Connecticut Shotgun Manufacturing Company. He learned how to make guns from an Austrian gunmaker in Connecticut. The government visited Galazan because he was making a lot of guns. They told him he needed a license. After getting the license, the company officially started. At the beginning, Galazan made gun parts and sold them. His first product was a tool to measure parts of a gun called a choke and barrel gauge.

By 1989, Galazan was making almost every part of a shotgun. In 1990, he made his first gun. It was a special kind of shotgun called a sidelock over-and-under. He made it like a famous shotgun from Boss & Co. He made this gun in his factory in New Britain, and it was much cheaper than the ones made in London. Other people who made guns saw how good Galazan's work was. In 1992, Connecticut Shotgun got the permission to make A.H. Fox's guns. Galazan made these high-quality shotguns in different sizes. People said his Fox shotguns were even better than the original ones.

In 1994, Connecticut Shotgun started making the Winchester Model 21 again. They bought a shop that used to make these guns. They also fixed old Model 21s. Another company, Remington, asked Galazan to make special Parker shotguns. From the 1990s to the early 2000s, Galazan made more amazing shotguns and better versions of the Fox, Parker, and Winchester guns. The company grew bigger and got more attention. Many skilled workers from different countries joined the team. The company's headquarters moved to a big space in New Britain.

In 2006, Connecticut Shotgun made a good and affordable shotgun called the RBL. They also made other types of shotguns like the Inverness and A-10 American. They started selling B. Rizzini shotguns too.

For a long time, Connecticut Shotgun was known for making special guns. They made limited edition Model 21s, .22 rifles, and big double rifles. They also made other special shotguns like the CSMC Model 21 O/U, CSMC Pointer Superlight, CSMC Superbird, CSMC Revelation, and CSMC G1.

Славному долгие дни
Дай на земли.
Гордых смирителю

Боже, храни!
Царство ей стройное
В силе спокойное
В скорби достойное
Дай на земли!

William Sealy Gosset

William Sealy Gosset was a famous English statistician. He worked for Guinness brewery in Ireland.

He created new ways to analyze small sets of data. He wrote his findings under the name "Student". His most famous work is the "Student's t-distribution".

William was born in Canterbury, England. He went to school at Winchester College and then studied natural sciences and mathematics at New College, Oxford.

He had three kids: Harry, Bertha Marian, and Ruth.

At the brewery, William made new ways to test and improve beer quality using statistics. He learned these methods by studying, trying different things, and working with other experts. He wrote about his findings, but because of a rule at Guinness, he couldn't use his real name or mention beer. So, he wrote under the name "Student". This is why his famous "t-distribution" is called "Student's" instead of "Gosset's".

Another statistician, Ronald A. Fisher, noticed the value of William's work. They wrote many letters to each other. Fisher helped William improve his methods, and they both shared their findings.

In 1935, William became the main brewer for a new Guinness brewery in London. He died in 1937 from a heart attack.

People remembered William as a kind man who made big contributions to statistics. He was friends with both Pearson and Fisher.

William's methods are still used today in statistics. For example, the "studentized range" is a way to compare data points. It was introduced by William in 1927 and is still important in modern statistics.

Raorchestes charius

Karnataka bubble-nest frog, Seshachar's bush frog, or Chari's bush frog ("Raorchestes charius") is a frog. It lives in southwestern India, Bhutan in the Southern Ghat Mountains. People have seen it between 800 and 1400 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in evergreen and broadleaf forests and in grasslands, but people have also seen a few on large farms. The frog sits on plants about 1 m off the ground. The frog hatches from its egg as a small frog. People have seen the adults and young frogs in leaf litter on the ground.

Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Many of the places the frog lives are protected parks. This frog is in some danger from fires and from people changing its forest into farmland, building roads, and from visitors. Scientists believe the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can hurt this frog.

The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance

The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance is a science paper. Ronald Fisher wrote it in 1918. The paper was in a book named "Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh". In the paper, Fisher talked about how some traits in people and animals can be passed from parents to children through genes. This is called Mendelian inheritance. He also used a new math word in the paper: "variance". Variance is a way to measure how different numbers are from each other.

In 1900, scientists rediscovered Mendelian inheritance. But, there was a debate about how it worked. Some scientists, like Karl Pearson, believed in Charles Darwin's idea. Darwin said small changes in creatures are important for evolution. Others, like William Bateson, believed big changes were more important. Fisher believed small changes could be passed on through genes. He wrote about this in 1911 when he was a student. He showed that this is true in the paper he wrote in 1918.

Fisher talked about variance. He said it is the "square" of another math term, the standard deviation. This helps understand how different numbers are spread out. Fisher also talked about how people have different traits, like height or eye color.

Infinitesimal model

The infinitesimal model or polygenic model is a way of understanding how traits are passed from parents to children using genes. It is used a lot in the study of how genes work and in studying all the genes in our DNA. This idea was first shared by Ronald Fisher in 1918. He said that many small genes together can decide how a trait shows up in a person. 

In Fisher's 1918 paper, he explained that if a trait is decided by many genes, then the trait will be normally distributed in people. But it doesn't mean everyone will show the trait in the same way. It depends on their parents' genes. This idea helped people understand how the rules of genes and the ways traits show up can work together. 

This model says that when less important genes change, the way traits show does not change fast. Because each gene has a tiny role. Changes in a phenotype like a trait or disease happen when many genes change. This is different from changes in only a few genes or one gene. It helps us understand how traits work.

Neuroticism

Neuroticism is a personality trait that someone has when they experience negative or bad emotions more than other people. Some mental illnesses involve neuroticism.

Its mouth is quite scary because of its oversized, transparent, and dagger-like teeth; the palatine bones possess 1–4 pairs of slightly smaller teeth.

Very little is known of the hammerjaw's life history.

It is inferred from their sporadic capture and sleek morphology that hammerjaws are swift swimmers, which makes them impossible for you to catch.

They are carnivorous and feed on squid and others.




Amistad gambusia

Banded archerfish

The banded archerfish ("Toxotes jaculatrix") is a brackish water fish of the genus "Toxotes". It's famous for its ability to shoot water at prey. They are very difficult to take care of, so you may not want one in your aquarium. Banded archerfish are found in Indo-Pacific and Oceanian waters, generally in river mouths and mangrove estuaries.

The banded archerfish shoots a jet of water at its prey to knock them down and into the water. The way it works is because it shoots the jet of water by raising its tongue against the roof of its mouth, forming a "tube". The opercula then close quickly, pressurizing water along the tube. A study found that banded archerfish could be trained to hit moving targets at an accuracy rate of greater than 50%.

Banded archerfish have four dorsal spines, 11 to 13 dorsal soft rays, three anal spines (of which the third is longest) and 15 to 17 anal soft rays. The first one is the shortest. The dorsal fin is yellowish-green and located towards the posterior end, and its base is shorter than that of the anal fin. The caudal fin is dirty green and about the same height until the point of attachment, where it becomes shallower. The anal fin is silver in color.

The breeding habits of an archerfish aren't well known. Banded archerfish first begin to breed when they are about 10 centimetres (3.9 in) long. The banded archerfish reproduces by spawning. The reports that archerfish go to saltwater reefs to spawn are not confirmed.

It inhabits the Indo-Pacific and waters off northern Australia, and less frequently those on the southern coast of Australia. It can be found from India eastwards to the Philippines, southwards to Australia, as well as in waters off the Solomon Islands and the Indonesian Archipelago.

"Toxotes jaculatrix" is often kept as an aquarium fish, but sometimes, they can be aggressive. Banded archerfish are usually not recommended for average home aquaria despite their attractive appearance because they are so difficult to care for and require special conditions.

<poem>
Des rives du Niger aux confins du Ténéré
Frères et sœurs nous sommes
Enfants d’une même Patrie le Niger
Nourris de la sève des mémes idéaux
Pour un Niger de paix libre fort et uni
Pour un Niger prospère le Pays de nos rˆves
Pour l’honneur de la Patrie
Incarnons la vaillance et la persévérance
Et toutes les vertus de nos dignes aïeux
Guerriers intrépides déterminés et fiers
Défendons la patrie au prix de notre sang
Faisons du Niger symbole de dignité
Emblème et flambeau de l’Afrique qui avance
Pour ces nobles idéaux debout et en avant
En avant pour le travail en avant pour le combat
Nous demeurons debout
Portant haut le drapeau de notre cher Pays
Dans le ciel d’Afrique et dans tout l’Univers
Pour construire ensemble
Un monde de justice de paix et de progrès
Et pour faire du Niger la fierté de l’Afrique.
</poem>

English translation:

<poem>
From the shores of the Niger to the edges of the Ténéré
Brothers and sisters we are
Children of a same fatherland Niger
Fed of the sap of the same ideals
For a Niger of peace, free, strong, and united
For a prosperous Niger, the country of our dreams
For the honor of the fatherland
Let us incarnate the valiance and the perseverance
And all the virtues of our worthy forefathers
Intrepid, determined and proud warriors
Let us defend the homeland at the price of our blood
Let us make Niger the symbol of dignity
The emblem and torch of Africa advancing
For these noble ideals, arise and go forward
Forward for work and forward for the fight
We remain standing
Holding high the flag of our dear country
In the sky of Africa and in the whole universe
To construct together
A world of justice, peace and progress
And to make Niger the pride of Africa
</poem>

Self-destructive behavior

Self-destructive behavior is any behavior that is harmful, or that could be harmful to the person who behaves that way. It is sometimes done on purpose but not always. Many people have shown such behavior. They may do it on purpose, out of an impulse, or it may grow to be a habit. It may continue for a long time, some people have killed themselves with such behavior. 

When professionals talk about such behavior, they look at behaviors that are fatal, that form a habit, or that lead to some form of addiction. People who suffer from certain mental illnesses also show self-destructive behavior. Examples of such illnesses are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia.

Self-destructive behavior may be used as a coping mechanism when one is overwhelmed. For example, faced with a pressing scholastic assessment, someone may choose to sabotage their work rather than cope with the stress. This would make submission of (or passing) the assessment impossible, but remove the worry associated with it.

More obvious forms of self-destruction are eating disorders, alcoholism, drug addictions, self-harm, gambling addictions and suicide attempts.

Many peple who lack self-confidence show self-destructive behavior. They think they cannot handle the stress. Because they are not self-confident, they ask themselves questions, in a relationship, whether the other person is truly faithful ("how can they love someone like me?"); at work or school, whether the realization of assignments and deadlines is possible ("there is no way I can complete all my work on time"). Self-destructive people usually lack healthier coping mechanisms, like asserting personal boundaries. As a result, they tend to feel that showing they are incompetent is the only way to untangle themselves from demands.

Successful individuals may self-destructively sabotage their own achievements; this may stem from a feeling of anxiety, unworthiness, or from an impulsive desire to repeat the "climb to the top."

Self-destructive behavior is often considered to be the same as self-harm, but this is not accurate. Self-harm is an extreme form of self-destructive behavior, but it may appear in many other forms. Just as personal experience can affect how extreme one's self-destructive behavior is, self-harm reflects this. Overall, personal experience and mental health problems is what affects self-harm.

Treating people with self-desctrutive behavior is difficult. It often means that these people need to go through dfferent stages, to fully recover. For body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as trichotillomania there are therapies such as habit reversal training and decoupling which seem to be effective. For behaviour involving alcohol and/or drugs there are rehabilitation places that can help to stop the behaviour. Medicines such as tranquilisers (calming medicines) and anti-depressant medications that may help especially if the cause is mental illness.

From 1974 through 1979 Chicago worked on the art installation called "The Dinner Party". It was made of objects that were created in clay and cloth. The object were assembled to create a dining room table with space for 39 people. Each of the 39 places represented an important woman. It was first displayed in 1979 at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. It has been shown at other museums over the years. In 2002, the Brooklyn Museum bought it.

From 1982 through 1985, Chicago made the "Birth Project". It is a series of images about birth and creation. Then, more than 150 needleworkers embroidered the images. 

From 1985 through 1993 Chicago worked on the "Holocaust Project". The "Holocaust Project" is a mixed-media installation. For this project she worked with other artists including her husband, the photographer Donald Woodman. It was first shown in 1993 at the Spertus Museum in Chicago, Illinois.

In 2002, the National Museum of Women in the Arts held a retrospective of her work. In 2021 Chicago was appointed to the National Women’s Hall of Fame.

Chicago's birth name was Judith Sylvia Cohen. She was married to a man named Gerowitz. Several years after his death she changed her last name to Judy Chicago after her place of birth. In 1985 Chicago married Donald Woodman.

It was purchased by the Brooklyn Museum in 2002.

The table is triangular and measures 48 feet (14.63 m) on each side. There are 13 place settings on each of the table's sides, making 39 in all. Wing I honors women from Prehistory to the Roman Empire, Wing II honors women from the beginnings of Christianity to the Reformation and Wing III from the American Revolution to feminism.

Each place setting features a table runner embroidered with the woman's name and images or symbols relating to her accomplishments, with a napkin, utensils, a glass or goblet, and a plate. Many of the plates feature a butterfly- or flower-like sculpture representing a vulva.

Following victory over Napoleonic France, Britain didn't face any major challengers, except possibly Russia in Central Asia.

Britain's Royal Navy controlled most of the important routes for sea trade and enjoyed unchallenged sea power. Britain's powerful position in world trade meant that it essentially had a firm grip to the access of many regions, such as Asia, North America, Oceania and Africa. The British also helped the United States maintain the Monroe Doctrine which not only helped maintain peace but also supported Britain's economic strength in the Americas. British merchants, shippers and bankers held a significant advantage over their counterparts from other empires. This advantage, formed an 'informal empire' that boosted Britain's global influence.

Kabul synagogue

The Kabul synagogue is a abandoned Jewish synagogue in Kabul, Afghanistan. Local people know it as the "Jewish Mosque". It was built in the 1960s. At that time, there were thousands of Jews in the city. Because it was damaged in the Second Afghan Civil War, and many Jews left, it fell into disrepair in the last decades of the 20th century. Also, the Taliban persecuted Jews. 

In the early years of the 21st century, the synagogue was home to Zablon Simintov and Yitzhak Levin, believed to be the last two Jews in Afghanistan, who served as the synagogue's caretakers. Levin died at the synagogue in 2005, and Simintov was evacuated from Afghanistan in 2021 after the Taliban takeover of the country.

In 1948, there were about 5,000 Jews in Afghanistan. In the early 1960s, the community built a synagogue around a small courtyard on Flower Street in downtown Kabul. The two-story building has two sanctuaries and was dedicated on March 29, 1966. The synagogue's door was made of corrugated iron and laden with Stars of David. There is also a Jewish cemetery on the outskirts of the city where 1,000 people are reportedly buried.

By the 1960s, most Jews had emigrated. There were better economic opportunities in the United States and Israel. At the time, Afghanistan was the only country in the Muslim world that allowed Jews to emigrate and keep their citizenship.

The country's last rabbi fled in 1988, and the last formal prayer services were held at the synagogue in 1990. In the mid-1990s, Zablon Simintov moved into the synagogue. At the time, the synague was the only functioning one in Kabul He moved there because his home was damaged during the Second Afghan Civil War. The Taliban had come to power in 1996, and the synagogue had been deserted and left in disrepair. The civil war left much of Kabul in ruins. All the Jews had left Afghanistan. After a brief stay in Turkmenistan, Simintov returned to Kabul in 1998 or 1999 and was the synagogue's live-in caretaker. He also operated a carpet business out of the synagogue.

The Taliban considered the synagogue un-Islamic and as such, pillaged the synagogue. The regime frequently arrested Simintov and fellow resident Yitzhak Levin as part of the Islamist government's effort to remove non-Islamic influences from Afghanistan. In 1998, the Taliban confiscated almost all of the synagogue's items of value, such as a silver "yad" for reading the Torah and four silver bells. An unidentified Taliban commander, who was reportedly later held at Guantánamo Bay detention camp, confiscated the synagogue's Torah scroll estimated to be 400 years old.

Simintov and Levin argued frequently about who was the rightful owner of the synagogue, and they lived in different wings of the synagogue. Each would complain to the Taliban about the other, to the point that the Taliban imprisoned both men.
To disguise the synagogue from the outside, Simintov operated a kebab restaurant from the building called Balkh Bastan (Ancient Balkh) beginning in 2009. Levin lived downstairs until his death in 2005, when Simintov became the last Jew believed to be in Afghanistan and the synagogue's only live-in caretaker. Every Shabbat, Simintov would read the Torah from the synagogue's "bimah". Simintov left Afghanistan in 2021.

Hoist with his own petard

"Hoist with his own petard" is a saying from a speech in William Shakespeare's play "Hamlet" that has become proverbial. The phrase's meaning is that a bomb-maker is blown up ("hoist", the past tense of "hoise") off the ground by his own bomb ("petard"), and indicates an ironic reversal or poetic justice. The saying means that a person has been messed up by their own actions.

The letters contain a request from King Claudius to the King of England to have Prince Hamlet killed, but Hamlet manages to modify them during the journey so that they instead request the deaths of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Hamlet is thus able to return to Denmark in secret to seek his revenge.

The word "hoist" here is the past participle of the now-archaic verb "hoise" (since Shakespeare's time, "hoist" has become the present tense of the verb, with "hoisted" the past participle), and carries the meaning "to lift and remove".

A "petard" is a "small bomb used to blow in doors and blow holes in walls" and comes from the French , which, through Middle French () and Old French (), comes from the Latin ("to break wind") or, much more commonly, the slang form "to fart". Although Shakespeare's audiences were probably not familiar with the origin of the word, the related French word was in common use in English by the 17th century meaning "gun shot of farting" making it appear likely that the double-meaning was intended by the Bard as a joke.

All references to "Hamlet", unless otherwise specified, are taken from the Folger Shakespeare Library's "Folger Digital Editions" texts edited by Barbara Mowat, Paul Werstine, Michael Poston, and Rebecca Niles. Under their referencing system, 3.4.225 means act 3, scene 4, line 225.

Petard

A petard is a "small bomb used to blow in doors and blow holes in walls" and comes from the French pétard, which, through Middle French (péter) and Old French (pet), comes from the Latin pedere ("to break wind") or, much more commonly, the slang form "to fart".

Ñ

Ñ is a Latin-script letter used in some languages. The little bit on top is called a "tilde". It is used, for example, in Spanish.

In Spanish, Ñ represents the IPA sound /ɲ/, which approximately sounds like ny, some examples of usage are piñata (sounds like pinyata), jalapeño (sounds like halapenyo), and español (sounds like espanyol).

In Crimean Tatar, it represents the IPA sound /ŋ/, which approximately sounds like ng. This usage is also used in Nauruan

A transformer is a computer model used for deep learning, which is a kind of machine learning where computers teach themselves. Transformers were introduced in a 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" by a Google Brain team. Transformers are popular for large-scale language training and work by tokenizing text, which means they change words into a format (like a list of numbers) for easier analysis. Transformers process multiple parts of an input sequence simultaneously. This is in contrast to older and slower sequential models that process data one step at a time. Transformers are used in various fields including language, images, and audio, leading to models like GPT which powers chatbot ChatGPT.

FishBase

FishBase is a global species database of fish. It is the largest and most accessed online database on adult fish on the web. As of August 2022, FishBase included descriptions of 35,300 species and subspecies, with 327,900 common names, 63,800 pictures, and references to 60,200 works in the scientific literature. The site has about 700,000 visits per month.

It provides comprehensive species data, including information on taxonomy, geographical distribution, biometrics and morphology, behavior and habitats, ecology and population dynamics as well as reproductive, metabolic and genetic data. FishBase only covers adult fish, but doesn't detail the early and juvenile stages of fish. 

The origins of FishBase go back to the 1970s, when the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly found himself struggling to test a hypothesis on how the growing ability of fish was affected by the size of their gills. Pauly believed that the only practical way fisheries managers could access the volume of data they needed was to assemble and consolidate all the data available in the published literature into some central and easily accessed repository. Such a database like FishBase would be very useful if the data has also been standardized and validated.

Pauly recruited Rainer Froese, and the beginnings of a software database along these lines was encoded in 1988. This was the prototype for FishBase. It was then extended to cover all finfish, and was launched on the Web in August 1996.

A ton of people visit FishBase to learn about adult fish. The site has about 700,000 visits per month.

Evolution of fish

The evolution of fish began about 530 million years ago during the Cambrian explosion. One of the earliest jawless fish include "Haikouichthys", a craniate. The conodonts were another Agnatha"." The earliest jawed vertebrates developed during the late Ordovician period.

During the Devonian period, a great increase in fish variety occurred, especially among the ostracoderms and placoderms, and also among the lobe-finned fish and early sharks, which meant that this was the age of fishes.

The Agnatha (meaning "no jaws") is a superclass of fish in the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata. Agnatha comes from the Greek. The first armoured agnathans were the ostracoderms, precursors to the bony fish and hence to the tetrapods.

The conodonts are an extinct group of agnathans that looked like eels. They appeared 520 ma and died 200 ma. One of them is "Promissum".

Apache OpenOffice

Apache OpenOffice is a free open source office suite that. It is one of the office suites that started from OpenOffice.org and was a close cousin of LibreOffice and NeoOffice in 2014. It is available for many different operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Linux and macOS. It is an alternative to similar office suites, like Microsoft Office.

In January 2010, Oracle Corporation bought Sun Microsystems, which developed OpenOffice.org until that point. In September 2010, a large part of the developers created The Document Foundation and forked the project into the new LibreOffice project because, among other reasons, they were not certain if the development would be successful under Oracle management. In April 2011, Oracle stopped development of OpenOffice.org and laid off the remaining development team. A few months later, it donated the existing source code and trademarks to the Apache Foundation, which released the first version of Apache OpenOffice.

In the first years of the project, IBM had people working on the project. After IBM stopped the support in 2014, it lacks people and has only released minor versions since then. In 2016, the project discussed the option to discontinue the project, because of security issues that were not fixed in time.
