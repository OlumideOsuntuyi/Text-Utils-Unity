Paul began his career in September 2013 posting videos on Vine. By the time Vine shut down, Jake Paul had 5.3 million followers and 7 million plays on the app.

In 2015, it was announced that Paul would be starring as Dirk in Disney Channel's new comedy series "Bizaardvark".

On January 5, 2017, Paul was among the invited guests at an event at the White House for social media people. As a stunt for his YouTube vlog channel, he hid in a bathroom there before sneaking out of the White House at 3:30am without being stopped by security guards.

On January 17, 2017, it was reported Paul had launched Team 10 with $1 million in financing to create influencer marketing management and creative agency around teen entertainment. Investors include Danhua Capital, Horizons Alpha, Vayner Capital, Sound Ventures & A-Grade Investments, and Adam Zeplain.

On May 30, 2017, Paul released a song and music video alongside Team 10, titled "It's Everyday Bro", which achieved over 70 million views on YouTube in its first month and has become the second most disliked video on YouTube, behind "Baby" by Justin Bieber. The song peaked at number 94 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 on the chart dated June 24, 2017.

On July 18, 2017, it was reported that Paul's neighbors in the Beverly Grove neighborhood of Los Angeles were meeting with city council members and police officials regarding whether to file a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Paul. This came after Paul made his home address public, leading crowds of fans to gather outside Paul's house, and noise complaints by neighbors. On April 24, 2018, it was reported that Paul was sued by Cobra Acquisitions; the company that owns the house, for $5 million.

On July 22, 2017, during the middle of filming the second season of "Bizaardvark", the Disney Channel announced that Paul would be leaving the series, saying in a statement "We've mutually agreed that Jake Paul will leave his role on the Disney Channel series 'Bizaardvark'. On behalf of the production company, the cast and crew, we thank Jake for his good work on the TV series for the past 18 months and extend our best wishes to him." The announcement followed a KTLA 5 news report about public complaints from Paul's neighbors regarding the noise generated by Paul's pranks, parties, fire hazards and the large crowds of Paul's fans congregating in their neighborhood. Paul later confirmed the news on his Twitter page, saying he would now focus more on his personal brand, his YouTube channel, his business ventures, and more adult acting roles. Paul later revealed in an interview with "The Hollywood Reporter" that he was actually fired from "Bizaardvark" by Disney who wanted to expedite the process of weaning him off the show due to the KTLA segment.

On January 3, 2018, Paul uploaded a video to his YouTube channel titled "how to fist" which caused controversy for being too sexually explicit and inappropriate for his younger audience. The video was criticized for its thumbnail which featured Paul and his then girlfriend Erika Costell semi-nude on a bed with Costell on top of Paul in a sexual position. The thumbnail was later changed with both Paul and Costell fully clothed and not touching each other. Later, a video had been leaked by TMZ which featured Paul explicitly using the word "nigga" whilst rapping. In the video, Paul uses the word twice, saying "little ass nigga" and "I whip it like my nigga Richie Vetter, he make the man's ass so wet it gets wetter."

Paul has English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Jewish and German ancestry. Paul has a net worth of about $17–30 million.

Paul began dating YouTuber and internet personality Tana Mongeau in April 2019. In June 2019, they were engaged to be married. Many people did not believe that the engagement was real. On July 28 of that year, they got married in Las Vegas. "InTouch" later reported that the couple had not got a marriage license before the ceremony. They said that it was not a legal marriage. Buzzfeed said that Paul and Mongeau left the ceremony separately. The ceremony, which was available on pay-per-view for $50, was recorded by MTV. Mongeau said that the ceremony was something "fun and lighthearted that we're obviously doing for fun and for content." The couple broke up in January 2020.

Later that month, Paul started dating Julia Rose. They said that they are dating as of February 2022.

Human geography

Human geography is a branch of geography. It studies how people and environment have an effect on each other. 

The study of people includes their communities, cultures, economies. The environment studied is mostly about locations. Locations include where people live, when people move, where they move to, what customs they have, what recreations they have.

Human societies develop in relation to the environment they are in. The relationship between people and the environment can change over time and across different locations. Human geography studies these changes.

The field of geography can be divided into physical geography and human geography. Human geography is also closely associated with social sciences and philosophy.

Reed Smoot

Reed Smoot (January 10, 1862 – February 9, 1941) was a republican senator from 1903–1933. He was also a leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and a businessman.

As a senator he is known for the 1930 Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act.

Smoot was an important leader of the LDS Church. He was chosen to serve as an apostle in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1900. Smoot's role in the LDS Church led to a controversy in the United States Senate. There were also rumors of polygamy and a secret oath against the United States A Senate committee questioned Smoot's authority in the Reed Smoot hearings. The committee suggested Smoot's removal, but the full Senate voted to keep Smoot. He lost the vote for office in 1932. Smoot returned to Utah in 1933. Smoot stopped working in politics and business and spent his time working in the church. At the time of his death, he was third in line to lead the LDS Church.

Smoot was born in 1862 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. He was the son of a Mormon pioneer from Kentucky and Iowa, Abraham O. Smoot, who was a mayor of the city from 1856 to 1862. His mother was Anne Kristina Morrison Smoot, also known as Anne Kirstine Mauritzen before her marriage. Anne Kristina Morrison Smoot was Smoot's father's fifth wife of six plural marriages and 27 children, three of whom Abraham O. Smoot adopted. The family moved to Provo, Utah, when his father was called by Brigham Young to head the stake there. Smoot went to school at the University of Utah (then a religious school) and graduated from Brigham Young Academy (now Brigham Young University) in Provo in 1879. After school, Smoot worked as a Mormon missionary in England. After returning to Utah, Smoot married Alpha M. Eldredge of Salt Lake City on September 17, 1884. They had six children together. Thereafter, Smoot became a successful businessman in the Salt Lake City area. In 1895, he became very involved in the government of the LDS Church and achieved more authority. On April 8, 1900, Smoot was chosen as an LDS Church apostle and member of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

After becoming an apostle in 1900, Smoot got permission from the LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith to run for office in 1902. He had joined the Republican Party. 

Smoot was voted by the Utah legislature to the United States Senate on January 20, 1903, as a Republican Senator representing the state. Smoot was introduced to the United States Senate by Utah's senior U.S. Senator, Republican Thomas Kearns, a Catholic who was elected in 1901. Kearns, an important mining leader, newspaper owner, banker, and railroad owner, had competed with Smoot for election to the Senate in 1900. Kearns was elected. Two years later Smoot ran again and won.

Smoot was elected again in 1908 and continued to be elected over and over again until 1932. He worked in the Senate until March 1933. A Constitutional amendment required the popular election of US Senators after 1913. Smoot lost 1932 election, the year in which Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidency.

In 1916, William Kent was the lead supporter in the House of Representatives of a law to establish the National Park Service. Smoot sponsored the law in the Senate. The law passed the House of Representatives on July 1, 1916. The law passed the Senate on August 5. The law was signed by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916. The National Park Service was placed within the cabinet Department of Interior.

Smoot was Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee from 1923 to 1933, and worked on the Senate Appropriations Committee. He worked on the national Republican Party and served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention every four years between 1908 and 1924. He was Chairman of the 1928 Resolutions Committee at the 1928 Republican National Convention and Chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Smoot was a co-sponsor of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930. This act raised U.S. import tariffs on over 20,000 items to higher than they had ever been. Many historians believe that it made the Great Depression worse. U.S. President Herbert Hoover signed the act and it became a law on June 17, 1930.

Mormon folklore

Mormon Folklore is a group of stories and things that express the culture of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It includes personal stories and shared stories, music, jokes, and art.

Mormon folklore has stories in it, told by word of mouth. Missionaries will tell stories as a part of initiation, or to try and tell others to do the right thing. People will tell stories about early people in the Church, people in the scriptures, and help from God. These stories are supposed to help people's belief. In the early days of the Church, songs would say both good things and bad things about leaders such as Brigham Young.

Common practices for Mormons include sharing testimonies during fast and testimony meeting. Members testify of the things they know to be true and occasionally share personal stories how they gained their testimony. In Mormon culture, marriage and family are very important. Pioneer Day is a state holiday in Utah, where members honor the early pioneer saints.

Early settlers in the Church were influenced by many cultures that came together in Utah. Handicrafts were part of this influence. They had many different projects, and the Relief Society said they were good for the mind. Lots of these can still be seen around Utah.

Mormon fundamentalists have different folklore than Latter-day saints do. Their experience in government raids makes them feel more together, and they like folk dancing.

Austin E. and Alta S. Fife are called the founders of research into Mormon folklore. This research has been done much more since the couple’s first work on it in the 1930s. Although people had looked at the issue a little before, the Fifes made the field better, through the Fife Folklore Archive, now at the library at Utah State University. Their book on Mormon folklore, called "Saints of Sage and Saddle", came out in 1956. This book, says someone who studies folklore named Jill Terry Rudy, "remains the most complete book-length treatment of Mormon folklore" - which means that it is the best book on Mormon folklore that there is.

Missionaries have their own set of folklore. Missionaries tell stories or sing church hymns, to connect with people they meet, to build friendship with those they teach, to inspire each other in missionary efforts, and to strengthen their own faith. In many missions around the world missionaries use church art, music and missionary stories as finding tools in proselytizing. Most young people in the church plays at least one musical instrument, the most common one is the piano.

Mormons often retell stories about early church members who went through extremely difficult challenges, and made many sacrifices in order to build God’s church. The purpose of those stories is to educate people about the historical events that took place at the beginning of the church history and the historical figures who were part of it. So, those who are currently members of the church can better understand the LDS heritage and the changes that occurred over the past years. Thus, they develop a deeper appreciation and gratitude for the early pioneers’ efforts to establish God's church and the legacy they left behind.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma

Nasopharynx cancer or nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most common cancer which is formed in the nasopharynx, most commonly in the postero-lateral nasopharynx or pharyngeal recess or 'Fossa of Rosenmüller' accounting for 50% cases. 

NPC happens in children and adults. NPC differs significantly from other cancers of the head and neck in its occurrence, causes, clinical behavior, and treatment. 

It is vastly more common in certain regions of East Asia and Africa than elsewhere, with viral, dietary and genetic factors implicated in its causation. It is most common in males. It is a squamous cell carcinoma or an undifferentiated type. Squamous epithelial cells are a flat type of cell found in the skin and the membranes that line some body cavities.

Protected area

Protected areas or conservation areas are locations with special protection. They are protected because of their recognized natural, ecological or cultural importance. Areas are usually protected by law. The law can be local, from the country of the protected area, or even internationally.

Protected areas are important for biodiversity. They often provide an area safe from hunting or changes to the environment. This provides a safe habitat for threatened and endangered species. They are also important to protect naturally formed areas, like the Grand Canyon, from damage by humans.

There are many types of protected areas. One type is a marine protected area. A marine protected area is for seas, oceans, estuaries or large lakes.

Northeast Greenland National Park is an example of a protected area. The park protects a large variety of animals, such as musk oxen, walrus, and King Eider. Another example of a protected area is the Valley of the Kings in Egypt. This area is protected because it is an important archaeological site.

Bush ballad

The bush ballad, bush song or bush poem is a style of poetry and folk music that describes the life, character and scenery of the Australian bush. Bush ballads usually have a simple rhyme structure. They can be funny or sad. The words used are colourful, colloquial and Australian. They tell stories of action and adventure about bushranging, droving, droughts, floods, life on the frontier, and relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.

The first ballads were created by British and Irish settlers and convicts who brought with them the folk music of their homelands. They were usually not written down, but passed around verbally. The ballads grew into a unique style over the years, becoming very popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Australians thought they were "an authentic expression of the national spirit". Through bush poetry, newspapers and magazines, like "The Bulletin", promoted mateship, egalitarianism, anti-authoritarianism and a concern for the "battler" as being ideal Australian values.

Bush ballads are not as popular in modern times, but the poems written up to Federation are still some of the best-known and loved poems in Australia. The "bush bards" such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson are regarded as giants of Australian literature. Clubs and festivals devoted to bush poetry can be found throughout the country, and the tradition lives on in Australian country music.

The songs tell personal stories of life in Australia. The stories can include mining, raising and droving cattle, sheep shearing, wanderings, war stories, the 1891 Australian shearers' strike, conflict between the working poor and the rich farmers (squatters), bushrangers such as Ned Kelly, love, and more modern themes such as trucking.

Although not technically bush ballads, there are also numerous sea shanties. These were work songs sung by whalers and sailors, as well as songs about the voyage made by convicts and other immigrants from England to Australia.

Modern musical styles for the ballads are different, even though the content is similar. Good examples of the older, traditional ballad style include Slim Dusty's When the Rain Tumbles Down in July or Leave Him in the Long yard. These have strong story lines in the verses, with choruses set to a Pick n' Strum beat. Modern bush ballads may use finger picking and strumming rock styles.

Australia's musical traditions include the English, Scottish, and Irish folk songs of the convicts, as well as the work of pastoral poets of the 1880s.
There was also a hymn singing tradition brought by missionaries in the 19th century. The beginnings of Australia's bush music come from the songs sung by the convicts who were sent to Australia from 1788. They tell of the harsh life of the time, and of people and events including bushrangers, swagmen, drovers, stockmen and shearers. Convict and bushranger verses often complained about the governments misuse of power. Examples include ballads like: The Wild Colonial Boy, Click Go The Shears, The Eumeralla Shore, The Drover's Dream, The Queensland Drover, The Dying Stockman and Moreton Bay.

Later bush ballads told stories of war, droughts, floods, Aboriginality, railways and roads. Isolation and loneliness of life in the Australian bush has been another theme. They often tell of the difficulties and struggles for the working poor people. The bush ballads are often ironic and humorous, for example "Beautiful Land of Australia." They were an oral and folkloric tradition, and only later published in print, such as Banjo Paterson's "Old Bush Songs", in the 1890s.

The lyrics for "Waltzing Matilda", often regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem, were written by Banjo Paterson in 1895. This type of Australian country music, with lyrics focusing on strictly Australian subjects, is generally known as "bush music" or "bush band music".

The ballads continued in Australia long after popular music took hold in Great Britain. The ballad style in rural England began dying out when land clearances, industrialisation and urbanization saw people moving from the farms into the cities. English popular music began in the working-class music halls during the 1830s and 1840s. Australia, which still had a large rural population, popular music was started a lot later.

As early as the 1920s, the different ethnic groups in Asutralia influenced the ballads. Poncie Cubillo introduced the rondalla with their Filipino string band in Darwin. The ballad tradition has grown to include some of these influences including Chinese and Filipino. There were also the Italians growing tobacco, the de Bortoli family, in "Texas in Queensland", adding to the mix of folk tunes and Tex Morton's hillbilly tunes. Morton, a country music singer from New Zealand, made a number of Australian-themed recordings between 1936 and 1943. These included the "Dying Duffer's Prayer," "Murrumbridgee Jack," "Billy Brink The Shearer," "Stockman's Last Bed," "Wrap Me Up in My Stockwhip and Blanket," "Rocky Ned (The Outlaw)," and "Ned Kelly Song". While these are a part of the bush ballad tradition, Morton sang without an Australian accent and used yodeling like the American singer Jimmie Rodgers. American cowboy and country songs and 1950s rock 'n' roll influenced Australian bush ballads. With increased modern communications, bush ballads share the modern Australian music scene with rockabilly, country music, blues, Texas swing, bluegrass, trail songs, and country pop.

Country and folk musicians including Slim Dusty, Stan Coster, Rolf Harris, The Bushwackers, John Williamson, Graeme Connors and John Schumann of the band Redgum, still record the old bush ballads. Contemporary artists including Sara Storer and Lee Kernaghan draw heavily on this heritage. Ashley Cook, a contemporary balladeer, sings about topics relevant to life in agriculture and mining work in Australia's outback: "Cattle, Dust and Leather" and "Blue Queensland Dogs". His song "Road to Kakadu" is about killing water buffalo in Northern Territory in the 1990s to control the Brucellosis disease. "Beneath the Queensland Moon" covers the life and death as a drover.

The bush ballad style is sometimes seen as unsophisticated and simple. This is because it uses cliched images and stereotypes.

The bush ballads have influenced Australian theatre and movies. Since the mid-20th century, bush songs have often been performed by bush bands, such as The Bandicoots or Franklyn B Paverty. There have been female bush balladeers, including Shirley Thoms (1925-1999) known as Australia's yodeling sweetheart, and Indigenous singer-songwriter Yvonne Bradley.

A number of awards have been set up to recognize bush balladeers. Jeff Brown was nominated for a Golden Guitar Award in the Bush Ballad of the Year category for a song he recorded "In the wings of the yard" in 2008. He said it was "...important to keep the old yarns alive through country music ballads. It's our heritage really and it needs to be kept alive somehow and the old bush ballads are the way to do it." Past winners of the Country Music Awards Australia Bush Ballad of the Year include Anne Kirkpatrick and Joy McKean. The Stan Coster Memorial Bush Ballad Award has several categories. In 2007 Reg Poole was male vocalist of the year for ‘A Tribute To Slim’, Graham Rodger was Songwriter of the Year for ‘The Battle Of Long Tan’, and Dean Perrett for Album of the Year for ‘New Tradition’ The magazine, the "Balladeers Bulletin" magazine also hold a "Bush Balladeer Starquest" competition. At the 2008 36th Country Music Awards of Australia held in Tamworth, Amos Morris became the youngest artist ever to win the Golden Guitar trophy for the Bush Ballad of the Year category with "Sign of the Times".

Irreligious theism

Irreligious theism is the belief that there is a higher being, but doesn't follow organized religion, this belief can be often confused for deism, however irreligious theists often believe that god can still interfere in the world, also irreligious theists believe in supernatural events like miracles, while deists don't believe in that. The thing that is common to irreligious theism and deism is belief in the God who created the world.

Irreligious theists can pray without necessarily going through a classic group place of worship (mosques, synagogues, churches) and without physical intermediary, only by thought,or in a chosen, isolated personal place. One can believe in a personal God without believing in or subscribing to the doctrines of an organized religion.

They don't need religion to help to distinguish good from evil, humans being have consciousness.They can live without depending on religious descriptions telling them how to behave and even sometimes hurt them in their feelings or desires for the cause described in religious books (ex: when all religions practically reject LGBT+ people, which can push them to harm themselves or even push parents to send their children to religious conversion therapies to make them "change" because the religious books have decreed by their writings that this was not "correct") and because of the religious writings it prevents people who think that they are not compatible, from linked belief in god and personal convictions feel obliged to belong to a religious group and do not think that irreligious theism can exist, and that there are no constraints or restrictions on believing in god without going through a religion.

You're also irreligious if you do believe in god but don't belong to a religious group or attend religious services. The ir- prefix, not, is attached to religious, "believing in a religion.

A very similar, but not necessarily identical and the same view is philosophical theism, which recognizes the existence of God on the basis ofrepresents belief in God entirely without doctrine, except for that which can be discerned by reason and the contemplation of natural laws. Philosophical theism conceives of nature as the result of purposive activity and so as an intelligible system open to human understanding, although possibly never completely understandable. It implies the belief that nature is ordered according to some sort of consistent plan and manifests a single purpose or intention, however incomprehensible or inexplicable. However, philosophical theists do not endorse or adhere to the theology or doctrines of any organized religion or church. They may accept arguments or observations about the existence of a god advanced by theologians working in some religious tradition, but reject the tradition itself. (For example, a philosophical theist might believe certain Christian arguments about God while nevertheless rejecting Christianity). Philosophical theism is very similar to deism and is based on the same assumptions. The only difference is that in philosophical theism the higher being (God) is not only the creator of the world, but also something more, beyond this, in addition to this. Philosophical theism does not exclude the possibility that this higher being may sometimes somehow interfere in the world he created. What may or may not distinguish philosophical theism from very similiar irreligious theism is that in philosophical theism the belief in God is based on reason, while in irreligious theism this is not necessarily the case, in irreligious theism it can also be one's own individual faith close to religious without a rational approach and irrational.

Famous irreligious theists from history include Austrian-American mathematician, logician, and philosopher Kurt Gödel, American rapper Tupac Shakur and American author Martin Gardner.

Mangani Festival

Managani festival is a world renowned festival celebrated in Karaikal city. It is celebrated in the memory Lord Bikshantar who will be provided food by Karaikal Ammaiyar, that is Amuthu Padayal in Tamil.

This festival's history relies on Karaikkal Ammaiyar's life.One day Ammaiyar's husband, Paramathathan, had sent two mangoes to be kept for him. That day a hungry Shaiva devotee (Lord Bikshantar) came to her residence. Ammaiyar gave the devotee, curd rice and one of the two mangoes which her husband gave earlier. Later, when Ammaiyar's husband came home, Ammaiyar served him the other mango. The mango was very delicious, and her husband requested that the other mango be served. Ammaiyar went inside kitchen, she didn't know what to do since the Mango is already served to the shaiva devotee(Lord Bikshantar). With Lord Siva's grace a Divine Mango appeared in her palm. Ammaiyaar was very happy and served the Mango to her husband.

As this fruit was divinely sweet and was infinitely delicious compared to the previous one, her husband inquired as to how Ammaiyar obtained this mango. Subsequently,Karaikkal Ammaiyar worshiped Lord's feet and revealed the truth to her husband, who didn't believe it. He asked her to show another mango with divine help. Ammaiyar prayed to Lord Shiva for another mango. Immediately Lord Shiva gave her a similar mango,which she gave it to her husband. The mango then disappeared, and Paramathathan realised the divine nature of his wife. He understood that Ammaiyar was worthy of worship and she cannot be treated as his wife. He then deserted Ammaiyar, becoming a trader and married the daughter of a merchant who then gave birth to their child. Paramathathan named the child with the real name of Ammaiyar, Punithavathi. When the word reached Ammaiyar's family, they decided that they must take her to him. When he saw his former wife, Paramathathan addressed her reverentially, saying that he realised Ammaiyar was no ordinary human being. He worshipped her with his wife and child. Ammaiyar prayed to Lord Shiva asking for a boon that she may worship Lord Shiva as a disembodied wraith. She received the boon, and leaving all her beauty and her body behind.This was the reason of formation of this grand festival of Mangani.

The celebration is celebrated in the Tamil month of Aani (June–July)lasting a month. Each day the Panchamurthi or the Five divine Gods idol are taken through each streets of Karaikal.

James Madison Sr.

Col. James Madison Sr. (March 27, 1723 – February 27, 1801) was a prominent Virginia planter and politician. He was a colonel in the militia during the American Revolutionary War. He inherited Mount Pleasant, later known as Montpelier, a large tobacco plantation in Orange County, Virginia and, with the acquisition of more property, had 5,000 acres and became the largest landowner in the county. He was the father of James Madison, 4th President of the United States, who inherited what he called Montpelier, and Lieutenant General William Taylor Madison, and grandfather of Confederate Brigadier General James Edwin Slaughter.

Col. James Madison Sr. was the son of planter and politician Ambrose Madison and his wife Frances Taylor, and was born in 1723 in Orange County, Virginia. When he was nine, his family moved to their new plantation of Mount Pleasant in 1732. His father had hired slaves and an overseer to clear it, work that had been going on for five years to establish cultivation. That summer (1732) his father died at age 36 in August after a short illness.

The family or the sheriff believed he was poisoned by slaves, and three were charged in the case and convicted by justices of the Commission of Peace. Unusually, only one slave was executed; Dido and Turk, owned by the widow Frances Taylor Madison, were returned to her to serve as laborers after being punished by whipping.

James was tutored and trained to be a planter and slaveholder, and member of the landed gentry. His widowed mother never remarried, which was unusual at that time for a woman her age; she had extensive Taylor family in the county. As the eldest son, James Madison Sr. inherited Mount Pleasant when he came of age in 1744. He called the plantation Home House. Acquiring more land, he eventually owned 5,000 acres, making him the largest landowner in Orange County. By the time of his death, he owned 108 slaves.

Madison married Nelly Conway (Port Conway, Caroline County, Virginia, January 9, 1731 – Montpelier, Orange County, Virginia, February 11, 1829), also of the planter class (her birthplace was named after her family). They had twelve children:

During the American Revolution, Madison was chairman of the Orange County Committee of Safety. He was commissioned as a colonel in the Virginia militia.

Vangunu giant rat

Uromys vika, also known as the Vangunu giant rat and locally known as the vika, is a giant species of rodent that lives in trees. It is in the family Muridae. The rat was discovered in the island of Vangunu in the Solomon Islands in 2015, after years of searching based on local stories, and described in 2017. It was identified as a new species on the basis of its skull, skeleton and a detailed DNA analysis. 

In November 2015 a wildlife ranger (Hikuna Judge) from the Zaira Conservation Area, saw something (outside the conservation area): "a large rat, [falling] from a 10m tree felled by loggers. The fall killed the rat - but the ranger shipped it to the Queensland Museum, in Australia, where ... Lavery was a fellow". Tyrone Lavery and Hikuna Judge published a species description, in 2017.

The rat fell of a tree, outside Zaira, a village on Vangunu Island.

The species is likely to be called "critically endangered" (as of 2017), because of the small amount of forest habitat (about 80 km) remaining on the island and ongoing logging.

Arrondissements of the Haute-Savoie department

There are 4 arrondissements in the Haute-Savoie department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into "arrondissements", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.

If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.

Arrondissements are further divided into communes.

The arrondissements of the Haute-Savoie are:

Since its creation in 1860, the Haute-Savoie department has had few changes:

Exotic atom

An exotic atom is an atom that has a particle replaced by a particle of the same charge. For example, Positronium, an exotic atom, contains an electron and a positron. The positron (which is the antiparticle of the electron) replaces a proton which would normally be found in that atom. Most exotic atoms are hard to discover, because they decay very quickly. Positronium on average has a half-life (how long until half of the object is gone via decay) of 0.125 nanoseconds. There are a few types of exotic atom.

A muonic atom is an exotic atom that has a muon, instead of an electron, orbiting the nucleus. Because a muon is much more massive than an electron, the muon orbits much closer to the nucleus.

A hadronic atom is an exotic atom that has an electron replaced by a negatively charged hadron. The hadron could be a meson (such as a pion or a kaon, creating a pionic atom or a kaonic atom, respectively). Another hadronic atom is an antiproton (antiparticle of the proton) atom, that has an antiproton replacing an electron. This is known as an antiprotonic atom.

An onium is an exotic atom that has a particle bound to its antiparticle. A good example is Positronium, which is an electron bound to a positron.

A hypernuclear atom is an exotic atom that contains strange particles (a particle that is made of a strange quark) called hyperons.


Plum pudding model

The plum pudding model is an early 20th century model of an atom. It was later found to be wrong. It was proposed by J.J. Thomson in 1904, after the electron had been discovered, but before the atomic nuclei was discovered. Scientists knew that there was a positive charge in the atom that balanced out the negative charges of the electrons, making the atom neutral, but they didn't know where the positive charge was coming from. Thomson's model showed an atom that had a positively charged medium, or space, with negatively charged electrons inside the medium. Soon after its proposal, the model was called a "plum pudding" model because the positive medium was like a pudding, with electrons, or plums, inside. 

In 1909, not long after Thomson's model was proposed, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden made an experiment with thin sheets of gold, to test Thomson's model. Their professor, Ernest Rutherford, expected the results to prove Thomson correct, but their results were very different to what they were expecting. In 1911, Rutherford discovered that the positive charges come from tiny particles called protons, and that the protons were in a tiny center called the nucleus, and that the electrons were orbiting around the nucleus.

Rutherford's model was quite simple, but it was later disproved because electrons have charge, and they should be attracted to the positively charged nucleus. In 1913, Niels Bohr added 'energy levels' to the atomic model. Electrons don't fall into the nucleus because they are contained in energy levels, and to change to higher energy levels extra energy is needed, and to change to lower energy levels a release of energy is needed. It is not possible to change energy states without changing the energy of the electron. If an electron gets hit by a photon (a particle that carries electromagnetic radiation) it will gain extra energy and go into a higher energy level (it changes states), then it will jump back down to a lower energy level, releasing its contained energy. This new model was called the Bohr model or the Rutherford-Bohr model. This added a whole new branch of science: Quantum physics.

In 1926 Erwin Schrödinger used the idea that electrons acted as a wave, as well as a particle, this is known as a wave-particle duality. This added a whole new layer to the atomic model and quantum physics. With a particle, you can know where it is in space if you observe (look) at it. But with a wave, it is all over the place, so you can't define where exactly it is. This is known as quantum uncertainty. With an electron, you can only know the probability of it being in a place, because it is a wave as well as a particle.

A dry toilet is for depositing human excrement without using water, very different from flush toilets that use water. It may be for sitting or squatting. The urine may get mixed with the feces or be kept separate.

There are different types of dry toilets: composting toilet, urine-diverting dry toilet, Arborloo, container-based toilet, bucket toilet, pit latrine, incinerating toilet, or freezing toilet.

All of these types of dry toilets work without flush water and without connections to sewers or septic tanks:

Other dry toilets are being developed, some with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

There are four main reasons for using dry toilets:

Dry toilets can be very presentable and are used in developed countries (for example, Sweden, Finland, and Norway), where they are often found at summer houses and national parks. They are more common in developing countries in places where flush toilets are not possible or not desired. Sewers often cost too much where the land is rocky or irregular and where houses are far from one another.

Some people strongly believe that dry toilets are the best way deal with excrement, others argue that they cannot be done everywhere, and others simply do not want to change their habits. Dry toilets reduce water consumption and pollution, recover valuable nutrients for agriculture, and (when managed properly) eliminate diseases and chemicals efficiently. 

It has been difficult to install and manage many dry toilets in cities (for example, in the Erdos Eco-City of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China). Designs need to be fine-tuned and carefully constructed and managed. The users also need to learn about the benefits of dry toilets and how to properly use them.

Nearly all toilets were dry toilets, and excrement was valued in agriculture, until flush toilets were invented.

In Britain, dry toilets were still used in some areas (including cities) until the 1940s. It seems that these were often emptied directly onto gardens, where the excreta was used as fertiliser. Sewer systems did not come to some rural areas in Britain until the 1950s or later.

Brisbane, Australia, was largely unsewered until the early 1970s, with many suburbs having dry toilets (called "dunnies") behind each house.

2017 Las Vegas shooting

On the night of October 1, 2017, Stephen Paddock fired hundreds of bullets from his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, United States at a group of concert-goers across the road at the Route 91 Harvest music festival with and AR-15. From his 32nd floor balcony, Paddock fired over 1000 bullets into the festival. He killed 60 people and wounded 411 before committing suicide. The panic meant that the total injured increased to 867. It is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States.

Paddock also thought about attacking other events before Las Vegas. He had researched events in Boston since at least May 2017, and had reserved a room near the August 2017 Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, but did not use it.

After Paddock used a hammer to break two of the windows in both of his suites at the Mandalay Bay, he began shooting through them at 10:05p.m. He ultimately fired over 1,000 rifle rounds approximately into the festival audience. He started out with a few single gunshots before firing in bursts that usually ranged from 80 rounds to 100 rounds. Many people in the crowd thought the gunfire was fireworks. During the shooting, a security fence stopped people from escaping the 15-acre concrete lot. The gunfire continued, with some short pauses, over the span of ten minutes and ended by 10:15p.m. During these pauses (during reload and while the assailant was confronting Campos), most people at the concert were able to escape the venue.

In addition to shooting at the concertgoers, Paddock fired eight bullets at a large jet fuel tank at Harry Reid International Airport away.

At 10:12p.m., two officers on the 31st floor reported the sounds of gunfire on the floor above them.

Between 10:26 p.m. and 10:30p.m., eight additional officers arrived at the 32nd floor. At 10:55p.m., the officers finished evacuating guests. At 11:20p.m., police breached Room 32–135 with explosives. Paddock was found dead on the floor from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. At 11:27p.m., officers announced over the police radio that a suspect was down.

The shooter was identified as 64-year-old Stephen Craig Paddock, who lived in Mesquite, Nevada. Police, relatives and neighbors described him as a gambler. When police arrived at his hotel room, Paddock was found dead there; he had killed himself with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His motive for the shooting is unknown and has not been discovered by investigators.

President Donald Trump posted on Twitter of his "warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting". In a public meeting with the press the next morning, he said the shooting was an "act of pure evil", a "senseless murder" and a "terrible, terrible attack". He praised the "miraculous" quick action of first responders. Later, he met with the victims on October 4, along with their relatives and police.

The Reich President was elected for a seven-year term by the German people, and could be re-elected. He was the head of the army, appointed and relieved the Reich Chancellor ("Reichskanzler"), and could also send away the Reichstag.

The Reich President was supposed to exercise the legislative power with the Reichstag but due to the instable situation of the Weimar Republic, he was often bypassing the Reichstag by using special legislation. This was the case during the early years of the Reich Presidency and especially in the early 1930s. During the Hitler period the Reichstag was just show.

Eisleben

Eisleben is a town in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is famous as the hometown of Martin Luther; because of this, its official name is Lutherstadt Eisleben. In 2015, Eisleben had a population of 24,198.

Eisleben has two parts old town and new town (Altstadt and Neustadt). The new town was created for Eisleben's miners in the 14th century.

Eisleben was the capital of the district of Mansfelder Land and is the seat of the "Verwaltungsgemeinschaft" ("collective municipality") Lutherstadt Eisleben.

Eisleben was first written about in 997 as a market called Islebia, and in 1180 as a town. The counts of Mansfeld governed the area until the 18th century. In 1780, Eisleben came directly under the Electorate of Saxony. After the Napoleonic Wars, Eisleben became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. The Prussian Province of Saxony became part of the Free State of Prussia in the German Reich after World War I. After World War II, Eisleben became part of the new state of Saxony-Anhalt in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) until Germany's reuinification in 1990.

In 1229, the Counts of Mansfield started a convent for women. At first, it was on the grounds of their castle. Then they built a separate convent at Helfta near Eisleben, which opened in 1258. It was governed under either the Benedictine or Cistercian model. It became known for its powerful and mystical abbesses, including Gertrude of Hackeborn, Gertrude the Great and Mechtild. However, Duke Albrecht of Brunswick destroyed the convent in 1342. It was rebuilt the next year. It closed in 1524, but later reopened on a smaller scale until 1542

In 1542, it came under the control of local farmers. In 1712 it became a farm run by the Prussian state. In 1994, the Catholic Diocese of Magdeburg bought the property and began restoring the building. Cistercian nuns from Seligenthal in Bavaria moved in starting in approximately 1999.

The Protestant reformer Martin Luther was born in Eisleben on November 10, 1483. His father, Hans Luther, was a miner. Luther's family moved to Mansfeld when he was only a year old; he lived in Wittenberg most of his life. Luther preached his last sermon and died in Eisleben in 1546.

Eisleben started preserving its Luther memorials in 1689.

In 1997, Eisleben's "Birth House" and "Death House" were added to the World Heritage List. Also, Luther was baptised in Eisleben's St. Peter and Paul Church. He preached his last sermons at St. Andreas Church.

The population has been declining since the mid-1960s due to declining birth rates and people moving away. The municipal area has been enlarged several times by merging with neighboring districts.

Astigmatism

Astigmatism is defined as the eye creating two images instead of one image on the retina. This happens when the power of the eye isn't the same in all directions, often because the front of the eye (the cornea) is shaped more like the back of a spoon than a perfect sphere. Astigmatism does not affect the health of the eye, and eyes with astigmatism can be perfectly healthy.

The result is that objects look blurry, but how much blur is different in different directions, which is why people with astigmatism often have trouble reading some letters but not others. It can also cause headaches and eyestrain. In most cases it is easily fixed with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery.

Bradford Bishop

William Bradford Bishop Jr. (born August 1, 1936) is a former United States Foreign Service officer. He has been a fugitive from justice since allegedly killing five members of his family in 1976. On April 10, 2014, the FBI placed him on the list of its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.

His last posting, which began in 1974, was at State Department Headquarters in Washington, D.C. as an Assistant Chief in the Division of Special Activities and Commercial Treaties.

Bishop was born in Pasadena, California. He studied at UCLA and at Yale University.

In 1976, after getting upset for not getting a work promotion, Bishop bought a sledgehammer and a shovel and murdered his wife and three children as they slept at their home in Bethesda, Maryland. With the bodies loaded into the station wagon, Bishop allegedly drove , about a six-hour drive, to a densely wooded swamp off North Carolina Highway 94, about south of Columbia, North Carolina. He would later burn the bodies and bury them in near the swamp.

Bishop has been spotted several placed in Europe by former State Department employees in Italy, Stockholm and in Switzerland.

In 2011, it was believed that Bishop died in Hong Kong and later in France, these proved to be false. In 2014, the FBI exhumed the body of an Alabama man who was killed in a road accident in 1981, believing he was Bishop. After DNA of the man was tested it was revealed the dead man was not Bishop and that he remains alive.

Exhumation

Exhumation is the act of digging up, especially a corpse. This is most often done to relocate a body to a different burial spot. 

Families may make this decision to locate the deceased in a more pertinent or convenient place. In shared family burial sites (e.g. a married couple), if the previously deceased person has been buried for an insufficient period of time the second body may be buried elsewhere until it is safe to move it to the requested grave. 

In most jurisdictions a legal exhumation usually requires a court order or permission by the next of kin of the deceased. Also in many countries permits are required by some governing agency like the board of health in order to legally conduct a disinterment.

Electron hole

An electron hole (often simply called a hole) is the absence or lack of an electron where an electron would normally be in an atom. Because electrons are negative and their charges are balanced by the positive protons, electron holes are positive in charge. Electron holes are not particles, they are classified as quasiparticles. Electron holes are different to positrons, which are the antiparticle to the electron. When electrons change energy levels, they leave an electron hole in their place.

Alternate ending

Alternate ending is a term used (usually in movies) to describe the ending of a story that was planned or debated but ultimately unused in favor of the actual ending. Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the canonical narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.

Alternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's DVD release. These alternative endings are a special type of deleted scene. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.

Some films also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.

The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:

In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.

India is a country in southern Asia. With over
1.3 billion people, India is the most populous democracy in the world. It is a federal constitutional republic governed under a parliamentary system consisting of 28
states and 8 union territories. All states, as well as the union territories of Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments, both patterned on the Westminster model. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the centre through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. Since then, their structure has remained largely unchanged. Each state or union territory is further divided into administrative districts.

The state and union territory capitals are sorted according to no legislative and judicial capitals. The administrative capital is where the executive government offices are located, the legislative capital is where the state assembly convenes, and the judicial capital is the location of the state or territorial High Courts. Union territories are marked with a dagger ().

National Day of the People's Republic of China

National Day is a yearly holiday in the People's Republic of China. It celebrates the beginning of its new government on October1, 1949. It is one of two Golden Weeks in the country, along with the Chinese New Year.

The Mandarin Chinese name of the holiday is "Guóqìng Jié", which means "Nation-Celebrating Holiday" or "Holiday of National Celebration". It is written in traditional characters and in simplified characters. The holiday has also become a common given name in China, with around 420,000 people named "Guoqing" in 2010.

From at least the time of the Western Jin dynasty in the late 3rd century, the birthday of the emperor was celebrated as a national holiday. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Republic of China celebrated its national day on October10.

Near the end of the Chinese Civil War, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party began the People's Republic of China on September21, 1949. This is sometimes known as "Chinese Independence Day". The PRC leaders and 300,000 Chinese celebrated the creation of the new government on October1 in Tian'anmen Square. At the first meeting of the first CPPCC on Oct.9, Xu Guangping introduced Ma Xulun's suggestion that China have a yearly national day celebrated apart from the birthday of the Communist Party. They recommended it be October1, the day of Mao's public message. The Central People's Government passed their suggestion on December2, making Oct.1 a yearly holiday.

National Day was celebrated with military parades in Beijing every year from 1949 to 1959. By 1960, the problems during the Great Leap Forward caused the government to suggest saving money on celebrations. From 1960 to 1970, there were no military parades but the day was still celebrated with large gatherings in Tian'anmen Square. After the Ninth Congress, the big meetings in Beijing were discouraged in favor of smaller events at parks and other locations from 1971 to 1983. 1984 saw the first military parade in many years, celebrating the PRC's 35th anniversary. There was another large military parade at the 50th anniversary in 1999, and a third at the 60th anniversary in the year after the Beijing Olympics.

Since the year 2000, National Day has been one of the country's Golden Weeks: there are three days of paid time away from work from Oct.1 to Oct.3 and two weekends around it are moved to make a 7 day long holiday. These Golden Weeks copied a similar Japanese idea. The 2017 National Day was 8 days long, because it also included the Mid-Autumn Festival. In 2014, the day before National Day became Martyrs' Day, celebrating the soldiers and other Chinese who died creating the PRC.

National Day begins with the raising of the national flag at Tian'anmen Square in Beijing.

The holiday is associated with large military parades in Beijing. The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party give speeches and watch from Tian'anmen, the southern gate of the Forbidden City, and millions of Chinese people watch from Tian'anmen Square and on television. China no longer has these parades every year, but the idea now is to have a smaller parade every 5th anniversary and a larger parade every 10th anniversary. When these parades occur, the city tries very hard to keep everyone safe and to make the event look good. For the 2009 parade, the city police added 1,120,000 volunteers to patrol the streets. 50,000 policemen and women worked more than 25 hours without stopping for rest or sleep.

Every year, many large groups of flowers are put along Beijing's Chang'an Avenue. The 2017 centerpiece measured across its base and stood high. Lan Hailang and dozens of other designers and officials made it from April to September, with at least 70 big design changes. The finished designs should show how China is getting better and what it plans to do next. Parts of the 2017 flower designs show the Belt-and-Road Initiative to make China's connections with Central Asia better; other parts show ways Beijing and Tianjin are going to be better over the next few years.

There are state dinners in Beijing and at Chinese embassies around the world throughout the week.

In the evening, fireworks are set off in Beijing, Hong Kong, and other large cities. There are also some singing, dancing, painting, and calligraphy celebrations. In Shanghai, the Tourism Festival's Music Fireworks Festival happens during the weeklong holiday. It is one of Asia's largest fireworks shows.

The long holiday also helps Chinese tourism, with millions of people traveling around the country visiting family members or sightseeing. This leads to higher prices and crowds, though, so foreign visitors are usually encouraged to come at other times of the year instead. The 1st day of the 2017 National Day vacation set records for the national rail system: more than 15 million trips were taken over 24 hours.

Unlike traditional Chinese holidays, National Day is not associated with any special food.


Hollow structural section

A hollow structural section (HSS) is a type of metal profile with a hollow tubular cross section. The term is used predominantly in USA, or other countries which follow US construction or engineering terminology. In the UK, or other countries which follow British construction or engineering terminology, the term HSS is not used. Rather, the three basic shapes are referenced as CHS, SHS, and RHS, being circular, square, and rectangular hollow sections. Typically, these designations will also relate to metric sizes, thus the dimensions and tolerances differ slightly from HSS.


Structural pipe fitting

Structural pipe fitting is a pipe used for various structures.

A Structural pipe fitting, also known as a slip on pipe fitting, clamp or pipe clamp is used to build structures such as handrails, guardrails, and other types of pipe or tubular structure. They can also be used to build furniture and theatrical riggings. The fittings slip on the pipe and are usually locked down with a set screw. The set screw can then be tightened with a simple hex wench. Because of the modular design of standard fittings, assembly is easy, only simple hand tools are required, and risks from welding a structure are eliminated.
Other advantages of using structural pipe fittings are easy installation and reconfigurable design. Since there are no permanent welds in the structure, the set screws of the fittings can simply be loosened, allowing them to be repositioned. The project can be disassembled and stored if needed, or even taken apart with fittings and pipe recycled into a new project.
Fittings used for strong structures are galvanised malleable iron castings, and come in many styles such as elbows, tees, crosses, reducers and flanges. The fittings are not threaded; they simply lock onto the pipe with the supplied hex set screws.

Arrondissements of the Isère department

There are 3 arrondissements in the Isère department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into "arrondissements", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.

Another publication called the "Pittsburgh Courier published his photographs. People called him ""One Shot" because he did not make people sit for a long time when he took their photos. He took more than 80,000 pictures in his life. 

He wasn't like other well-know photographers. Other photographers either took portraits or photographs of other places. Harris was unusual because taking photographs was part of his regular job in one city. His photos were not often seen in other places until after his death in 1998.

He took photos of famous people that visited Pittsburgh like:  Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billy Eckstine, Lena Horne, Sarah Vaughan, Sam Cooke, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, Charlie Parker, Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis, Eleanor Roosevelt, John F.

He let another businessman, Dennis Morgan sell his photographs in 1986. Harris filed a lawsuit in 1998 for unpaid royalties and the return of his collection. He won the case after he died. The Carnegie Museum of Art purchased the collection from the Harris estate in 2001.

Since 2003, the museum has scanned and cataloged nearly 60,000 images. Many of these are available online. Many people help to identify the people in his photographs.

Dragon Boat Festival

The Dragon Boat Festival is a yearly holiday in the People's Republic of China. It celebrates Qu Yuan, a writer and a government leader who lived a long time ago and died because he loved his country very much. The Dragon Boat Festival is always on the 5th day of the 5th month of China's old calendar, but—because that calendar is based on changes in the moon and not the sun—it is not always on the same day of the new calendar. The old calendar adds a 13th month when it is very different from the seasons, though, so the Dragon Boat Festival is always in late spring.

In Chinese, the Dragon Boat Festival is usually called "Duānwǔ Jié", which means the "Holiday of Welcoming the Seventh". This name is based on the old calendar, which used a group of 12 names as a kind of week. Chinese people write it in traditional characters and in simplified characters.

A long time ago in China, this holiday may have celebrated the harvest of "winter wheat" or dragon gods with power over rivers and seas. By the time of Sima Qian, an important writer of history who lived around 100, different people used the festival to remember Qu Yuan, Wu Zixu, or Cao E. Today, most Chinese people are taught that the holiday remembers Qu Yuan.

Qu Yuan was an important writer of poems who lived around 300. He lived at a time when the government of China was very weak and all its different parts began to say they were different countries. Qu Yuan's part was called Chu, and its king Xiong Huai was so powerful that he controlled Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and most of the places around them. King Huai listened to other leaders who said bad things about Qu Yuan and made him move to the countryside twice. King Huai also made other mistakes that also hurt Chu. The second time that Qu Yuan was sent away, he wrote a long poem about his sadness and then killed himself by walking into the Miluo River with a heavy stone. People don't agree about exactly why he did this but most think it was because of sadness for his country or a last try to make his king pay attention to his many mistakes.

The Republic of China celebrated the Dragon Boat Festival as to celebrate Qu Yuan and other Chinese writers.

For a long time, the People's Republic of China did not pay attention to the Dragon Boat Festival but, in 2005, it was one of three traditional Chinese holidays approved for celebration. Since 2008, it has been a national holiday.

All over China, people make and eat little pyramids of sticky rice called zongzis to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival. In southern China, some people also race dragon boats in rivers or in the sea. Both traditions are said to have started when local people ran to the Miluo River to throw zongzis around Qu Yuan's body to protect it from fish and dragons.

There are also some older traditions to get ready for the Chinese summer, like drinking rice wine with pesticides to avoid snakes and mosquitos. These are less common today.

Scriptio continua

Scriptio continua (Latin for "continuous script") is a style of writing that does not use spaces, different letter cases, or punctuation to tell apart words, phrases, or sentences. It was a common way of writing for texts in Ancient Greek and Classical Latin. 

Although spoken Greek and Latin did use punctuation to tell words apart, "scriptio continua" was used to save space and ink. 

Use of "scriptio continua" became less common after the fall of the Roman Empire, and spaces began to appear between words. The first known documents that used spacing were Irish and Anglo-Saxon Bibles and Gospels. However, "scriptio continua" is still used for the writing systems for several modern languages, including Southeast Asian abugidas like Thai, Lao, Khmer, Burmese, Javanese, Balinese, and Tibetan. Languages that use the Chinese character system like Chinese and Japanese sometimes use "scriptio continua", even though modern Chinese and Japanese stopped using it when they adopted punctuation during the 19th and 20th centuries.

One of the things to be noticed is the change from professional scribes to general literacy, which occurred in all languages. In other words, writing went from being something only a few people were trained to being something most people would be able to do. The growth of literacy is the main indirect reason why most modern languages have punctuation.

The first sentence below is the first sentence of Ovid's Metamorphoses written in Latin using "scriptio continua" writing, the second is the same sentence written in Latin using spaces, punctuation and cases, and the third is an English translation. In all the Latin sentences, all the letter U's have been replaced with letter V's.

The first sentence is the biblical verse John 3:16 in the King James Version written in English using "scriptio continua" writing, and the second is the same sentence written in English using spaces, punctuation and cases.
Due to the internet, modern English developed a form of "scriptio continua" through email and URL web addresses. Since spaces are invalid characters, the URL for the website "Example Fake Website" would be examplefakewebsite.com.

Chinese had no sort of punctuation until the 20th century, and only added punctuation because of their interactions with Western countries. Chinese is still fairly readable even without punctuation and spacing because each Chinese character represents an entire word or morpheme (the smallest meaningful units of language) instead of single sounds like an alphabet.

The first sentence below is a sentence written in modern Chinese, the second is the same sentence using "scriptio continua" writing, the third is the sentence written with spaces in between the words, the fourth is the sentence written in Hanyu Pinyin, and the fifth is the sentence translated into English.

Like Chinese, Japanese also does not use spacing in its writing. Even though Japanese also uses many Chinese characters (called kanji in Japanese) in its writing, the two languages are actually very different from each other. When Japanese was first written, it was written entirely in kanji and man'yogana (kanji used only for writing the sounds of Japanese). Chinese characters could be used to either tell a words' pronunciation or its meaning, so it made Japanese very hard to read. Even native Japanese speakers had a hard time reading ancient Japanese writings.

Later during the 10th century, the Japanese created different sound-based systems to write more quickly and to tell apart phonetic-loan characters and semantic-based characters more easily. These writing systems are called kana.

Today Japanese uses three different writing systems, kanji for showing the meanings of words, and hiragana and katakana for showing the sounds of words. While Japanese does not use spacing, native Japanese speakers can still tell apart words quickly because the three different types of writing look quite different from each other, and each writing system is usually used for a certain kind of word. Kanji is usually used to write native Japanese words, Chinese loanwords, and the roots of content words (nouns, adjective, adjectives, adverbs). Hiragana is usually used for common phrases, particles, and the inflections of content words. Katakana is usually used for loanwords from languages other than Chinese, onomatopoeia, and for extra emphasis.

Also like Chinese, it used no punctuation until after it had major interactions with Western countries, and it did not have any punctuation until the Meiji Period, when Japan quickly modernized.

The first sentence below is sentence written in Japanese using hiragana, katakana and kanji without spaces between words. The second is written in hiragana, katakana and kanji with spaces in between words (including particles). The third is written only in hiragana and katakana. The fourth is written entirely in romaji (Japanese written in the Latin alphabet). The fifth is the sentence translated translated in English. The sixth is written using "scriptio continua" entirely in kanji and man'yōgana.

Unlike most modern languages, Thai is still written without punctuation or spaces most of the time. Only clauses, rather than single words or phrases, are set apart by spaces. Since Thai has strict syllable structure rules, trained readers of Thai can recognize single words even without spaces. The syllable structure of a Thai word is C¹(C²)V(C³), which means that only two consonants can come before the vowel and one consonant can come after the vowel. For example, the clause สวัสดีครับ "s(à)wàtdeekráp" is made of four syllables, but if they were written with spaces between syllables, it would be written as ส วัส ดี ครับ "s(à) wàt dee kráp". The syllable structure of the four words in the same order are


Even if a word or syllable is spelled without any vowels written, an inherent vowel must still be spoken. For example, the word มด would be written as "md" if written the Roman alphabet, but it must be pronounced as "mót" /mot/, since the vowel /ɔ/ or /a/ must be spoken for any Thai word with no written vowel.

Below is a greeting in Thai, first written in Thai with no spaces, second written in Thai with spaces, third written in Thai written in the Roman alphabet, fourth an English translation.

South Luzon Expressway

The South Luzon Expressway, more commonly known by its abbreviation SLEx or SLEX, is a controlled-access highway in the Philippines. It connects the National Capital Region (or Metro Manila) to the provinces of the southern part of Luzon, the main island in the country. Measuring 51 kilometers or 32 miles long, it starts at an intersection with Quirino Avenue in the district of Paco in Manila. It then passes through the settlements of Makati, Pasay, Parañaque, Taguig, and Valenzuela in the capital area and the provinces of Cavite and Laguna in Southern Luzon. It ends at an exit in the settlement of Santo Tomas in the province of Batangas, where it continues as Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (or better known as STAR Tollway).

Pulilan

Pulilan is a municipality (or a town) in the province of Bulacan, Philippines. It lies 50 kilometers northwest of Manila and is located at the west-central part of the province.

According to the 2015 national census (a total count of the country's population) of the Philippines, it has 97,323 people.

The town is famous for its Carabao Festival, which happens once a year in May.

Yamato kotoba

Yamato kotoba (kanji: 大和言葉, hiragana: やまとことば) are words that are native to the Japanese language. The word itself is also a native Japanese word, interestingly enough. Yamato kotoba can also be called by its Chinese based name, wago (kanji: 和語, hiragana: わご). It is one of the three main sources of Japanese words, along with "kango" (kanji: 漢語, hiragana: かんご), or Chinese loanwords, and "gairaigo" (kanji: 外来語, hiragana: がいらいご), or loanwords borrowed from languages other than Chinese (especially English since the post-WWII era).

Yamato kotoba in Japanese has much in common with native English words in that most of the everyday vocabulary comes from yamato kotoba, while Chinese loanwords words (much like Latin and French loanwords in English) are used for more formal situations (usually writing) and for specialized terms.

Usually, words with only one kanji are yamato kotoba, such as "katana" (kanji: 刀, hiragana: かたな, meaning: sword), "sakana" (kanji: 魚, hiragana: さかな, meaning: fish), "kami" (kanji: 紙, hiragana: かみ, meaning: paper), "yama" (kanji: 山, hiragana: やま, meaning: mountain) "te" (kanji: 手, hiragana: て, meaning: hand), and "oyogu" (kanji and hiragana: 泳ぐ, hiragana only: およぐ, meaning: to swim). Most kanji (the Japanese version of Chinese characters) have two different kinds of pronunciation, on'yomi (the pronunciation of the kanji borrowed from Chinese) and kun'yomi (the native pronunciation of Japanese words that use the kanji). Yamato kotoba words use the kanji's kun'yomi.

Since on'yomi came from Chinese monosyllables (words with only one syllable), they themselves are also only one syllable, and like Chinese, they can have a CV or CVC structure. For example, the on'yomi for the following kanji 刀, 魚, 紙, 山, 手, and 泳 are "tō, shi, san, shu, and ei." However, kun'yomi can have one or multiple syllables, and those syllables are usually a CV structure, like the examples given above.

Since Japanese uses three different writing systems interchangeably, even yamato kotoba can be written in several different ways. For example, the word "sushi" can be written entirely in hiragana as すし, entirely in katakana as スシ, in kanji as 鮨 or 鮓, or in ateji (kanji used only to show a word's pronunciation and not its meaning) as 寿司 or 壽司.

Kanji usually show the root meaning of the word. While nouns are usually written only with kanji, they can also be written in kana if they are very common words, like "sushi", or if their kanji is not well known, not part of the "jōyō kanji" (a standard list of 1,945 kanji all Japanese adults are expected to know) or too difficult to remember how to write, like "bara," whose kanji is 薔薇, but is usually only written as ばら in hiragana or as バラ in katakana. 

Japanese also invented many of its own kanji to name things that could be found in Japan, but not China (usually plants and animals). These are called "kokuji" (kanji: 国字, hiragana: こくじ) meaning "national characters", or "wasei-kanji" (kanji: 和製漢字, hiragana: わせいかんじ) meaning "Japanese-made Chinese characters". "Kokuji" include the names of fish like "iwashi" (kanji: 鰯, hiragana: いわし, meaning: sardine), "tara" (kanji: 鱈, hiragana: たら, meaning: codfish), and "kisu" (kanji: 鱚, hiragana: きす, meaning: sillago), and trees like "kashi" (kanji: 樫, hiragana: かし, meaning: evergreen oak), "sugi" (kanji: 椙, hiragana: すぎ, meaning: Japanese cedar), and "kaba" or "momiji" (kanji: 椛, hiragana: かば/もみじ, meaning: birch/maple). Most "kokuji" only have kun'yomi because they are "yamato kotoba", but some kanji also have on'yomi, like 働 (on'yomi: dō どう, kun'yomi: hatara(ku) はたら(く), meaning: work), and some have only on'yomi, like 腺 (on'yomi: sen せん, meaning: gland). 

Other content words like verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are usually written in a combination of kanji and hiragana, where the root of the word is written in kanji and the inflectional morphemes (the parts of the word that don't change the central meaning of the word's root) are written in hiragana. For example, the native Japanes verb meaning "to swim" is "oyogu" in its plain form, where it is written as 泳ぐ in kanji and hiragana. The kanji 泳 shows the verb's meaning, while ぐ (gu) as in "oyo-gu" shows that the word is in its plain form. The polite form of "to swim" is "oyogimasu", which is written as 泳ぎます in kanji and hiragana. Once again, it has the same kanji, but it ends with different syllables ぎます (gi-ma-su) as in "oyo-gimasu" to show that the word is in the polite form. Native Japanese adjectives usually end in with the syllable い ("-i)," like the word "hayai" (kanji and hiragana: 速い, hiragana only: はやい, meaning: fast), "takai" (kanji and hiragana: 高い, hiragana only: たかい, meaning: tall, high), and "ookii" (kanji and hiragana: 大きい, hiragana only: おおきい, meaning: big or large), while native Japanese adverbs are simply adjectives that end in く ("-ku") rather than い, like "hayaku　"(kanji and hiragana: 速く, hiragana only: はやく, meaning: quickly).

Nouns based on adjectives end with the syllable さ ("-sa"), as in "hayasa" (kanji and hiragana: 速さ, hiragana only: はやさ, meaning: speed), "takasa" (kanji and hiragana: 高さ, hiragana only: たかさ, meaning: height), and "ookisa" (kanji and hiragana: 大きさ, hiragana only: おおきさ, meaning: size/largeness).

Sometimes, native Japanese nouns can be written with multiple kanji. These are usually proper nouns like family names or place names. Japanese family names are usually "yamato kotoba", like Tanaka (kanji: 田中, hiragana: たなか), Yamamoto (kanji: 山本, hiragana: やまもと), and Kobayashi (kanji: 小林, hiragana: こばやし). Most Japanese place names are also "yamoto kotoba", like Ōsaka (kanji: 大阪, hiragana: おおさか), Ehime (kanji: 愛媛, hiragana: えひめ), and Hiroshima (kanji: 広島, hiragana: ひろしま), although there are also plenty of Japanese places with Chinese-based names, like Tōkyō (kanji: 東京, hiragana: とうきょう), Mt. Fuji or "Fuji-san" (kanji: 富士山, hiragana:ふじさん), and Honshū (kanji: 本州, hiragana: ほんしゅう).

While usually cardinal numbers (numbers for measuring things) in Japanese are based off of Chinese words, most ordinal numbers (numbers for ordering things) and even certain measure words use native Japanese words. The following table has Sino-Japanese numerals (Japanese numbers based on Chinese) on the left and native Japanese numerals on the right.

Cheyenne people

The Cheyenne (/ʃaɪˈæn/ "shy-AN") are a people of the Great Plains. The language they use, the Cheyenne language, is part of the Algonquian language group. Now, the Cheyenne people are broken into two nations seen by the government: the Southern Cheyenne, who are part of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Oklahoma, and the Northern Cheyenne, who represent the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana. The Cheyenne comprise two Native American tribes, the Só'taeo'o or Só'taétaneo'o (usually spelled as Suhtai or Sutaio) and the Tsétsêhéstâhese (also spelled as Tsitsistas, like [t͡sɪt͡shɪstʰɑs]). The tribes connected in the early 19th century.
At the time of their first European contact, the Cheyenne lived in what is now Minnesota. They were close allies of the Arapaho and loosely aligned with the Lakota. By the early 18th century, they were forced west across the Missouri River and into North and South Dakota, where they adopted the horse culture. After settling the Black Hills of South Dakota and the Powder River Country of present-day Montana and Wyoming, they introduced the horse culture to Lakota people around 1730. With the Arapaho, the Cheyenne pushed the Kiowa to the Southern Plains. In turn, they were pushed west by the more numerous Lakota.

Liberland

Liberland, also called the Free Republic of Liberland, is a micronation on an unclaimed piece of land on the western part of the Danube River between Croatia and Serbia. Liberland was founded on 13 April 2015 by Czech libertarian activist Vít Jedlička.

The Liberland website says the nation was created on no-man's land (terra nullius) that emerged because Croatia and Serbia have not agreed on common borders for over 25 years. This border dispute includes some areas to the east of the Danube which are claimed by both Serbia and Croatia. Croatia considers some areas on the west side of the river, including Liberland, to be part of Serbia, although Serbia no longer claims that land.

The land has been patrolled by Croatia since the Croatian War of Independence but Croatia has blocked people from coming to Liberland since shortly after its founding, including Croatian citizens and other EU citizens. Before that, just about anyone could visit the area. Licensed hunters, fishermen and employees of Hrvatske šume d.o.o. (Croatian Forests Ltd., a state-owned timber company) visit. Since August 2023, Liberlanders have been present in the territory, although Croatian border police check passports of everyone entering and leaving. Croatian border police impose Croatian laws against open fires and closed tents. 

No country that is a member of the United Nations has given diplomatic recognition to Liberland, although Liberland has opened official relations with Somaliland and Haiti as well as other partially recognized and unrecognized states and micronations. In November 2021, El Salvador received a diplomatic delegation from Liberland. 

The border disagreement along the Danube River valley started in 1947 but was left unresolved during the existence of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After Yugoslavia broke apart, the disagreement became more prominent. Serbia claims the center line of the river is the international border between the two countries. The Croatian government disagrees and claims that the international border lies along the old lines of the cadastral municipalities along the river — as the Danube was in the 19th century before meandering and hydraulic engineering works changed its course. As a result, Croatia claims a large part of the area controlled by Serbia, while Serbia does not claim the smaller parts on the other side.

President Jedlička says that the land claimed for Liberland, known as "Gornja Siga" (meaning "upper tufa"), remains unclaimed by Croatia or Serbia.

The area is about , and most of it is covered with forests. A journalist from the Czech newspaper "Parlamentní listy" who visited the area in April 2015 found a house that had been abandoned for about thirty years, according to people living nearby. The access road was reported to be in a bad condition.

The Danube River, an international waterway with free access to the Black Sea for several landlocked nations, runs along the self-proclaimed territory. Liberland visitors and citizens visit the coast by boat from Apatin, Serbia and other ports and docks along the Danube River. Liberland keeps its ships the Bitcoin Freedom and the SS Liberty at the local marina, has bought land and buildings in the Apatin Free Trade Zone and recently opened "Ark EcoVillage" on a piece of land formerly known as Zelena Glava ("Golden Head").

The flag ceremony in Gornja Siga was performed by Vít Jedlička and others on the day the statehood of Liberland was proclaimed.

The flag is a yellow background (symbolizing libertarianism) with a black horizontal stripe through the centre (symbolizing anarchy or rebellion) and the coat of arms in the centre. Jedlička is a member of the Czech Party of Free Citizens, which bases its values on the classical liberal ideology.

Jedlička stated that neither Serbia, Croatia nor any other nation claims the land (no-man's land or "terra nullius"). The border, he argued, was defined according to both Croatian and Serbian border claims and did not interfere with any other state's sovereignty. Jedlička said in April 2015 that an official diplomatic note would be sent to both Croatia and Serbia, and later to all other states, with a formal request for international recognition.

On 18 December 2015, President Jedlička presented the first provisional government of Liberland and its Ministers of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Interior and Justice as well as two vice presidents.

Croatian authorities have generally blocked entry to Liberland since early May 2015, with limited exceptions for licensed hunters and fishers. Since August 2023, Croatian border police have allowed small groups of Liberlanders to cross over into Liberland from Croatia during daylight hours, subject to passport control upon entry and exit. 

In May 2015, Vít Jedlička and his translator Sven Sambunjak were detained by Croatian police after making an attempt to cross the border. Jedlička spent one night in jail and then was convicted and ordered to pay a penalty for illegal crossing of the Croatian border. He appealed the verdict. He claimed that there were at least three Liberland citizens inside the area, who came from Switzerland. Later that month, Vít Jedlička was detained again. Initially, reporters were able to enter the area with Jedlička but later they were also denied entry, including journalists from the Serbian public broadcast service Radio Television of Vojvodina, and from the Bosnian newspaper "Dnevni Avaz".

The people arrested were from many countries, including Ireland, Germany, Denmark, and the U.S. Croatian police continued to arrest people, including those who entered the area by boat via the international waterway. One of them, a Danish activist Ulrik Grøssel Haagensen, was placed in house arrest for 5 days before being sentenced to 15 days of prison, triggering some protests in Denmark.

In May 2016, several appeals court decisions from Croatia were published. The court upheld the rulings that crossing into Liberland from Croatia is illegal, but found the convictions for entering Liberland from Serbia were not correct. A retrial was ordered in 6 of the 7 appeals. The lower court was therefore required to determine the location of the border and the border crossing, but has not done this yet. Since that time, visitors have come the area in boats and conflicts with Croatian police have been avoided. 

Croatia joined the Schengen Area on January 1, 2023; while Liberland lies outside the Schengen Zone and outside of the jurisdiction of the Croatian police, they claim to administer the area and check the documents of persons crossing over into the territory. 

Youtube host Niko Omilana visited Liberland successfully in April 2023, releasing a video of his visit in July 2023 that received over 5 million views in four days. Since August 6, 2023 there has been a continuous presence of settlers and visitors, despite ongoing difficulties with the Croatian police and the state forestry company, which uses part of the area as a source of timber. Various events have been held in Liberland since the settlement began, including a wedding on the beach and an MMA match. 

Croatia and Serbia dismissed Jedlička's claims as not important, although the two countries reacted in different ways. On 24 April 2015, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while they consider the affair a trivial matter, the "new state" does not infringe upon the Serbian border, which they say is the Danube River. Croatia, which blocks most visitors from accessing Liberland, has stated that after international arbitration, it should be awarded to Croatia or Serbia, not to a third party.

An article in the Chicago Journal of International Law, the law review of the University of Chicago Law School, examined Liberland's claim to statehood in light of the criteria laid out by the Montevideo Convention. According to the author, "Croatia’s insistence that Liberland is part of Serbia could constitute a renunciation of Croatia’s legal rights to Liberland. Conversely, if the territory that Liberland claims as its own is Serbian, the Serbian government’s renunciation of its title to that land could also be a quitclaim that would transform the legal status of the land to "terra nullius". In both instances, the territory would belong to the first entity —in this case Liberland— to claim it.”

Legal experts in Serbia and Croatia have asked if, under international law, Jedlička has the right to claim the area, which is currently the subject of a dispute between the two nations but claimed by neither one. Journalists have been uncertain as to how serious Jedlička is about his claims, with some calling it a publicity stunt.

On 20 May 2015 Petr Mach, the leader of the Party of Free Citizens, expressed support for the creation of a state based on ideas of freedom, adding that the Party of Free Citizens wants the Czech Republic to become a similarly free country.

Goran Vojković, professor of law and columnist from the Croatian news portal "Index.hr", described Liberland as a "circus which threatens Croatian territory", and argued that there was a risk that Croatia's claim to control land on the other side of the Danube may be weakened by the attention that the Liberland project has drawn to the border dispute.

In 2016, an article in Stratfor summarized the initiative as follows: "Liberland is a curious case because, in principle, none of the actors that could claim control over it seems interested in doing so. But this will probably remain a curiosity with negligible consequences at the international level. For the rest of the world's disputed territories, violence and diplomacy will remain the main tools to claim ownership.

According to its web page, Liberland is currently looking for those who have respect for other people and respect the opinions of others, regardless of their race, ethnicity, orientation, or religion, have respect for private ownership, and have not been punished for serious criminal offences. Liberland received 200,000 applications in a week. In the beginning of May 2015, Liberland accepted around thirty citizens. An event was supposed to take place in the claimed territory, but Croatian border police stopped the group from entering it from the Croatian side. As of October 2017, Liberland has awarded citizenship to between 300 and 400 people, to persons who have "helped move the country forward" or earned at least 5000 Merits. On February 16, 2018, former Congressman Ron Paul was presented with a Liberland passport and citizenship certificate by Jedlička and his cabinet.

Liberland also presents an Order of Merit award called the "First Class Order of Merit" to persons who have contributed to the development of Liberland or to the ideas of freedom. Recipients have included publisher Steve Forbes, economist Mark Skousen, a Croatian Member of Parliament, and others.

The Liberland constitution has been drafted and revised several times. The draft consists of four chapters. It includes a Bill of Rights and regulates the public administration, the political institutions, the legislative power, and the judicial power.

There has been no diplomatic recognition of Liberland by any member of the United Nations. Liberland has established relations with Somaliland, a self-declared state that proclaimed its independence from Somalia in 1991. Liberland and Somaliland signed a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2017 promising to establish closer relations and cooperate in the areas of technology, energy and banking. 

Liberland President Jedlička and members of Liberland's provisional government make regular goodwill visits around the world to make the case for Liberland and to promote diplomatic and commercial ties to the project. In 2017, Jedlička met with U.S. Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ben Sasse and the Democratic Shadow Senator from Washington, D.C. Paul Strauss as well as several other elected representatives in the United States. In February 2018, Jedlička and his U.S. team went to Washington, D.C. to meet with Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as well as Senator Lamar Alexander.

Liberland has also established relations with the region of Savoie (Savoy), an independent and self-governed territory from the 11th century until 1860, when it was annexed to France. Today, Savosian people are a minority in their own territory and their claims are not taken into account by the government of France. Liberland has also begun dialogue with the region of Brittany (Bretagne), among others.

On 5th December 2018, UK Libertarian MEP Bill Etheridge and Paul Brothwood hosted an event for Liberland in the European Parliament to discuss its future.

Liberland also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the government of Haiti on the 5th of March 2020. The agreement was signed by Joseph Jouthe, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Haiti at that time.

In 2021, Liberland sent a delegation to El Salvador during Bitcoin Week and met with several government officials. The Liberland Aid Foundation gave a more than 1 Bitcoin donation (over $60,000 US at the time) to the Hospital de Niños Benjamin Bloom in San Salvador.

In July 2023, Liberland sent a delegation to Zagreb, Croatia and met with current President Zoran Milanović, former President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović and others. 


Since 2015, several minor freedom parties have expressed support for the creation of Liberland. They are the Capitalist Party in Norway, the Libertarian Party (Spain), The Swiss Independence Party up! (Unabhängigkeitspartei), the Liberal Democratic Party (Turkey) (LDP) the Libertarian Party of Canada, the Libertarian Party (United States) and the UK Libertarian Party.

A few micronations have expressed support for Liberland.




Carolinas

The Carolinas are the U.S. states of North Carolina and South Carolina. They were both part of the original Thirteen Colonies, which gained independence from the British Empire in 1783. During the colonial period, the southern portion of the Carolinas was primarily a support for the British West Indies; where thousands upon thousands of slaves were brought in to feed the growing trade. The same could not be said about the northern part of the region, which was a sparsely populated area, mostly inhabited by decommissioned servants from the Chesapeake area, many of whom set up small tobacco farms.

Philippe de Nanteuil

Philippe de Nanteuil () was a French knight and troubadour. He was a vassal of Thibaut de Champagne, the King of Navarre. and became Thibaut's friend. Philippe de Nanteuil inherited the "seigneurie" of Nanteuil-le-Haudouin in northern France from his father. His father was also called Philippe de Nanteuil.

Philippe de Nanteuil fought with other French knights in the Crusades. In 1239 he and many other French knights lost a battle against the Ayyubids at Gaza. They were taken prisoner by the Ayyubids and put in a prison in Cairo. Philippe de Nanteuil wrote a famous song while he was in prison. It was called "En chantant veil mon duel faire". The song was about the defeat of the Christian knights. It criticized the leaders of the three main military orders, the Knights Templar, the Knights Hospitaller, and the Teutonic Order.

Gairaigo

Gairaigo (kanji: 外来語, hiragana: がいらいご) are loanwords in the Japanese language from languages other than Old or Middle Chinese. The word itself literally means "loan word". Most "gairaigo" come from European languages, and especially English since the post-WWII era, though Modern Chinese and Modern Korean are also popular sources for loanwords. Most gairaigo nowadays are written in katakana, with some older ones being written in ateji (kanji used only to show a word's pronunciation and not its meaning) or even in hiragana. For example, while America, or "Amerika" in Japanese, can be written as 亜米利加 in ateji, it is rare to do so these days, and instead it is almost always written in katakana as アメリカ.

"Gairaigo" is one of the three main sources of Japanese words, along with "kango" (kanji: 漢語, hiragana: かんご), or Chinese loanwords, and "yamato kotoba" (kanji: 大和言葉, hiragana: やまとことば), or native Japanese words.

Japanese has a long history of borrowing words from other languages. Since the Chinese character system gave Japanese a writing system (as Japanese had no known systems of writing beforehand), the Japanese naturally borrowed many Chinese words into their language. However, the Japanese only borrowed words from other Asian languages until the Portuguese and the Dutch came to Japan during the 16th century. Since the Portuguese and the Dutch traded many different goods with the Japanese at this time, the Japanese naturally included many Portuguese and Dutch words into their own language, including "karuta" (ateji: 加留多 or 歌留多, hiragana: かるた, katakana: カルタ) from the Portuguese "carta" meaning "letter", "tempura" (ateji: 天麩羅 or 天婦羅, ateji and hiragana [most common form]: 天ぷら, hiragana: てんぷら, katakana: テンプラ), from the Portuguese "tempora" meaning "temperance", as Catholics would not eat red meat during Lent, and "tabako" (kanji: 煙草, hiragana: たばこ, katakana: タバコ) from the Portuguese "tabaco" meaning "tobacco". While these terms used to be written mostly in ateji (and they still can be), they are now mostly written only in hiragana or katakana.

During the Meiji Period, after Matthew Perry forced Japan to open trade with other countries, Japan sent many scholars to Western countries to study different field of knowledge, such as Western medicine in Germany, an art in France. However, since the end of the 19th century, and especially after WWII, most "gairaigo" came from English. Today, about 90% of all "gairaigo" come from English.

While many "gairaigo" came from English, Japanese has also invented many new words based off of English, but wouldn't be understood by native English speakers. These are called "wasei eigo", or "Japanese-made English words". Many of them are shortenings of English words such as "amefuto" (katakana:アメフト) which is a shortening of "American football", "pasokon" (katakana:パソコン) which is a shortening of "personal computer", "konbini" (katakana:コンビニ) which is a shortening of "convenience store", and "anime" (katakana: アニメ) which is a shortening of "animation". While each of these words have a longer gairaigo word that go along with them which would be "amerikanfutobōru" (katakana:アメリカンフットボール), "pāsonarukonpyūtā" (katakana:パーソナルコンピューター), "konbiniensusutoa" (katakana:コンビニエンスストア), and "animēshon" (katakana:アニメーション) in that order, they would be too long for a Japanese person to say in conversation. Also, some words got a new meaning when they come into Japanese. For example, "consent", or "konsento" (katakana:コンセント) in Japanese, means "electrical outlet" rather than its original meaning, and "range", or (katakana:レンジ) in Japanese, means "stove" rather than its original meaning.

Tupper Lake (town), New York

Tupper Lake is a town in Franklin County, New York. In 2020, 5,147 people lived in the town.

The settlement began around 1844. The village was settled during the town's lumber production period and grew after it gained railroad service. The early village was composed of two parts, Tupper Lake proper and Faust. The town for a time held the distinction as the top lumber producer in the state.

The great fire of 1899 burned more than 169 structures in the village, two-thirds of them being homes. The modern village grew out of this destruction and added all the amenities of a modern community earlier than many other villages in the state. Tupper had its own department store and synagogue, and its sprawling railway yards, driven by the lumber trade, made it a hub for the surrounding Adirondack communities.

Sino-Japanese vocabulary

Sino-Japanese vocabulary, Chinese-based Japanese words, or kango (kanji: 漢語, hiragana: かんご), are Chinese loanwords in the Japanese language. The two languages are unrelated to each other, since Chinese is a Sino-Tibetan language while Japanese is a language isolate (meaning that no known languages are related to it). However, Chinese has had a major influence on Japanese and has effected many parts of it, including its phonology (how it organizes sounds) and its vocabulary. Including Chinese words into Japanese lead to allowing words to have closed syllables (syllables ending in a consonant), like the words "san" (kanji: 三, hiragana: さん, meaning: three) and "udon" (kanji:饂飩, hiragana: うどん) and for words to have long vowels and long consonants, like "nō" (kanji:能, hiragana: のう) and "gakkō" (kanji: 学校, hiragana: がっこう). Before Chinese words came into the Japanese language syllables in Japanese words only had open syllables (words that end in a vowel) like "katana" (kanji:刀, hiragana: かたな) and "shinobi" (kanji and hiragana: 忍び, hiragana only: しのび).

It is one of the three main sources of Japanese words, along with "yamato kotoba" (kanji: 大和言葉, hiragana: やまとことば), also known as "wago" (kanji: 和語, hiragana: わご), or native Japanese words, and "gairaigo" (kanji: 外来語, hiragana: がいらいご), or loanwords borrowed from languages other than Chinese (especially English since the post-WWII era).

It is said that about 60-70% of Japanese words come from Chinese. Like how French and Latin are to English, Chinese loanwords are used to create formal vocabulary and technical terms in Japanese. For example, while the native English words are "moon" and "horse", the Latin terms "luna" and "equus" is used to create technical terms like "lunar calendar", a calendar that is based on the moon, and "equine science", the study of horses. Likewise, the native Japanese word for horse is uma (kanji: 馬, hiragana: うま) while the Chinese term is ba (kanji:馬, hiragana: ば), which is used in terms like basha (kanji:馬車, hiragana: ばしゃ, meaning: horse carriage), jōba (kanji:乗馬, hiragana: じょうば, meaning: horse riding), and gunba (kanji:軍馬, hiragana: ぐんば, meaning: warhorse).

Most Chinese loanwords are nouns, and they are often made up of more than one kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese). Most kanji have two different kinds of pronunciation, on'yomi (the pronunciation of the kanji borrowed from Chinese) and kun'yomi (the native pronunciation of Japanese words that use the kanji). "Yamato kotoba" words use the kanji's kun'yomi. While Japanese usually use the kun'yomi for words of just one kanji, like 火 (on'yomi: ka, meaning: fire) which is pronounced "hi", and 山 (on'yomi: san, -zan, meaning: mountain) which is pronounced "yama", when you put together the two kanji, 火山, the word will not be pronounced by their kun'yomi as "hiyama", but rather they will be pronounced by their on'yomi as "kazan", which the compound word fire+mountain means "volcano".

While most Chinese loanwords in Japanese are nouns, they can also be used to make verbs, adjectives, and adverbs as well. While most Japanese verbs are native Japanese words, Chinese loanwords can be made into verbs using the "-suru" form. For example, the Chinese loanword "kinshi" (kanji: 禁止, hiragana:きんし) is a noun that means "prohibition" or "ban", but if you add "-suru" afterwards, as in "kinshi-suru" (kanji and hiragana: 禁止する, hiragana only: きんしする), it becomes a verb that means "to prohibit" or "to ban". Also, adjectives can be formed from nouns by adding the suffix "-teki" (的) to it. For example, while the word "shikaku" (kanji: 視覚, hiragana: しかく) is a noun that means "vision" or "sense of sight", adding "-teki" afterwards makes it into the word "shikaku-teki" (kanji:視覚的, hiragana: しかくてき) which is an adjective that means "visual".

Even though kanji a Chinese invention, Japanese has also created many Chinese-based words itself that were adopted into Chinese. These words are called "wasei-kango" (kanji:和製漢語, hiragana: わせいかんご) which means "Japanese-made Chinese words". Many of these words describe things that are uniquely Japanese, such as "Shintō" (kanji:神道, hiragana: しんとう), "dōjō" (kanji:道場, hiragana:どうじょう), "Bushidō" (kanji:武士道, hiragana:ぶしどう), "matcha" (kanji:抹茶, hiragana:まっちゃ), and "seppuku" (kanji:切腹, hiragana:せっぷく).

Since Japan was the first East Asian country to modernize, the Japanese were the first people in East Asia to be exposed to new technologies and fields of study, and therefore the first to develop Chinese-based names for such things, such as telephone (denwa, kanji:電話, hiragana: でんわ), science (kagaku, kanji:科学, hiragana:かがく), and philosophy (tetsugaku, kanji:哲学, hiragana: てつがく), and each of these terms have been adopted into Chinese as "diànhuà", "kēxué", and "zhéxué" in the same order. This phenomenon is called reborrowing.

President of Liberia

The President of the Republic of Liberia is the head of state and government of Liberia. The president serves as the leader of the executive branch and as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Liberia.

The current President is Joseph Boakai since January 22, 2024.

Between 1847 and 1980, the presidency was exclusively held by Americo-Liberians, the original American settlers of Liberia and their descendants. The original two-party system, with the Republican Party and the True Whig Party, ended in 1878, when the election of Anthony W. Gardiner marked the beginning of 102 years of single-party rule by the True Whigs.

Under the 1986 Constitution, the president is directly elected by eligible voters to a six-year term, which may be renewed once. Overall, 22 individuals have served as president. On January 22, 2018, George Weah was sworn in as the twenty-fifth and current president.

Under the original 1847 Constitution, the president was elected to a two-year term, which was increased to four years on May 7, 1907. Under this amendment, a new president would serve for eight years and could be re-elected to unlimited four-year terms.

Currently, the president is elected by popular vote to a six-year term and is limited to two terms.

It is usually done by lightly grabbing the middle of the penis with one hand and while grabbing slightly above from the middle towards the testicles, repeatedly stroking the penis until the male reaches orgasm. Stimulation of the scrotum may also be accompanied, such as placing both the index and rude finger against the males testicles then placing your little finger on the tip of his foreskin. It is like fingering which is the sexual stimulation of a female's vulva using the fingers.

Ventilator

A ventilator is a machine which artificially moves air in and out of the lungs of a patient in order to help them breathe if that patient cannot breathe on their own or breathe properly. Some ventilators can also be used in order give patients anesthesia and can be part of an anesthetic machine.

There are different types of ventilators which can work differently, but they all help pump air into and out of the lungs using pressure.

Some types of ventilators require someone else to make them work by hand and help the patient breathe for a short period of time: they are called manual resuscitators.

Bag-valve masks (BMVs) have an oxygen mask which covers the nose and mouth of the patient, a one-way valve attached between the mask and the bag which filters the moving air and prevents the air to be breathed back into the bag, and an inflatable bag which holds the air in and is squeezed by hand. An operator squeezes the bag which forces air into the patient's lungs, and as the hand releases the bag is the patient breathes out into the outer environment and the bag refills itself with outside air. The bag is squeezed and released by hand repeatedly in order to keep the patient breathing.

Amnesia bags is another type of manual resuscitator in which the bag does not refill itself with air as the patient is breathing. Instead, the bag is filled with air or gas beforehand and the bag is either squeezed by hand or the patient can inhale the air or gas inside of bath if they can breathe on their own.

Mechanical ventilators work by themselves without manual operation and are usually controlled by computers, and can be powered by either electricity connected to a wall outlet or battery, or pneumatics without the use of electricity. The air can be moved in and out of the patient by attaching an oxygen mask on the patient or by connecting the ventilator to a breathing tube inserted into the nostrils, the larynx or the trachea. They are used to help the patient breathe for a long period of time.
Positive pressure ventilators work by blowing air from the outside or from an oxygen tank or air tank through a pneumatic reservoir which holds and compressing the air, or through a turbine which turns around and forces the air through a mask or breathing tube and into the patient. As the air is forced into the lungs, the patient would later breathe out through a "patient circuit" with a one-way valve.
On the other hand, a negative pressure ventilator, also known as an "iron lung" or a tank respirator, is a chamber which is enclosed around the patient's chest and lowers the pressure inside the chamber around the chest area to a point in which the pressure inside the chamber is less than the pressure outside allowing the patient to breathe in, and then the pressure inside heightens to a point in which the pressure inside the chamber is greater than the pressure outside allowing the patient to breathe out. This process occurs periodically. Negative pressure ventilators are now considered obsolete and instead positive pressure ventilators are used in its place.

Tagus

The Tagus ( ; ; ; Ancient Greek: Τάγος "Tagos") is the longest river in the Iberian Peninsula. 

It is long, in Spain and in Portugal. For it forms the border between Portugal and Spain. The river flows into the Atlantic Ocean near Lisbon. 

It drains an area of (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the Douro). The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to most of central Spain, including Madrid, and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. 

Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a vast alluvial valley prone to flooding. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated.

The source of the Tagus is the Fuente de García, in the Frías de Albarracín municipal term, Montes Universales, Sistema Ibérico, Sierra de Albarracín Comarca. All its major tributaries enter the Tagus from the right (north) bank. The main cities it passes through are Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera de la Reina and Alcántara in Spain, and Abrantes, Santarém, Almada and Lisbon in Portugal.

Automated external defibrillator

An automated external defibrillator is a special type of defibrillator which can be used by people without medical education. A defibrillator is used to treat certain kinds of heart problems using controlled electric shocks. Almost all heart problems are medical emergencies. For each minute, that such a heart problem is left untreated, the chance of survival drops by about ten percent. Even if they are alerted immediately, emergency teams take some time to arrive. For this reason automated external defibrillator have been placed in locations where they are easily accessible, such as airports, and railway stations.

In many cases, using such a defibrillator will alert emergency services. Very often, the defibrillator will guide the person helping through its use. In some countries such as the United Kingdom, regional public ambulance services provide lists for people to show where all the publicly accessible defibrillators are located in their region (East of England Ambulance Services Trust for example). In some open public locations, defibrillators are secured in special cases which need a code to open them (see the example on the right). When you call for an ambulance, you tell the operator the location code on the case, and they give you the code to unlock it to get the defibrillator out.

Studies where conducted to see the survival rates of cardiac arrest. They showed that when public access defibrillators were used, the patient had a median chance of survival of forty percent. When operated by non-dispatched lay first responders they have the highest likelihood of leading to survival.

Commodity substitution bias

Commodity substitution bias is a problem with the calculation to find the change in an item's price change over time. 
It occurs when a new item which costs less is purchased instead of an item that was already available. This problem occurs because the CPI ( Consumer Price Index) is calculated from a ""fixed basket"" of goods and services. The CPI ignores the substitution of the inexpensive item for the expensive item. So CPI says the price of the expensive item had increased.

History of organizational changes in the NHL

In 1917, games started to be played in the National Hockey League. In the first two seasons, there were only three teams, but now, there are thirty-one. Over the time that it has been around the NHL has added and lost teams many times. This is the complete history of organizational changes in the NHL. 

The first four NHL teams were the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, the original Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Arenas, but after only playing four games, the Wanderers arena was burned down. This made them leave the league. 

In the 1919-20 NHL season, the NHL added its first new team - the Quebec Bulldogs. Also, the Toronto Arenas changed their name to the St. Patricks. In the 1920-21 NHL season, the Quebec Bulldogs moved to Hamilton and became the Tigers. 

Two new teams joined the league in the 1924-25 NHL season - the Boston Bruins and the Montreal Maroons.

The next season, the NHL added another new team - the Pittsburgh Pirates. Also, the Hamilton Tigers moved to New York City and became the New York Americans.

The NHL continued to add teams the next season, adding the Chicago Black Hawks, the Detroit Cougars and the New York Rangers. This means the league finished its first season with three teams in 1917, but ended up with more than three times more by the end of their first decade. Also, during this season, the Toronto St. Patricks changed their name to the Maple Leafs. In the 1930-31 NHL season, the Pirates moved to Philadelphia and became the Quakers, while the Detroit Cougars changed their name to the Falcons. 

The NHL finally lost a team four the first time in fourteen seasons. The Philadelphia Quakers and Ottawa Senators did not play in the 1931-32 NHL season. 

In the 1932-33 NHL season, the Ottawa Senators rejoined the league and the Detroit Falcons were renamed the Red Wings. In the 1934-35 NHL season, the Ottawa Senators moved to St. Louis and became the Eagles.

The NHL lost the Eagles after playing just one season in St. Louis and the league was again an eight-team league for three seasons.

The league lost the Montreal Maroons in the 1938-39 NHL season, bringing the number of teams to seven, the same number of teams there were 12 years before. There were seven teams for four seasons. The last season there was this many teams was 1941-42. That year, the New York Americans moved to Brooklyn and left the league the next season.

When the league lost the Brooklyn Americans in 1943, a new era began called the Original Six era. For the next 25 years, there were no organization changes.

The 1966-67 NHL season was the last year of the Orginal Six era because in the 1967-68 NHL season, there were 12 teams, or twice as many as there were the year before. The new six teams were the California Seals, the Los Angeles Kings, the Minnesota North Stars, the Philadelphia Flyers, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the St. Louis Blues. During this season, California was renamed the Oakland Seals. 

The Oakland Seals were then renamed the California Golden Seals for the 1970-71 NHL season. The same year, the league added two new teams - the Buffalo Sabres and the Vancouver Canucks. 

Two more teams joined the NHL two years later - the New York Islanders and the Atlanta Flames. 

Again, after two years, two more teams joined the NHL - the Washington Capitals and the Kansas City Scouts. Two years later, the California Golden Seals moved to Cleveland and became the Barons. The Kansas City Scouts moved also to Denver and became the Colorado Rockies. 

In the 1978-79 NHL season, the members of the Cleveland Barons franchise became part of the Minnesota North Stars. This was the forced time since 1942 that the league lost a team. 

In 1979, the World Hockey Association (WHA) ended and four teams from the league joined the NHL. They were the Edmonton Oilers, the New England Whalers (who became the Hartford Whalers after joining the league), the Quebec Nordiques and the Winnipeg Jets. At this point, the NHL had three Canadian teams, but with three of the teams coming from the WHA being Canadian, there were then twice as many Canadian teams as before.

In the 1980-81 NHL season, the Atlanta Flames moved to Calgary Flames. Then, in the 1982-83 NHL season, the Colorado Rockies moved to Newark and became the New Jersey Devils. In the 1986-87 NHL season, the Chicago Black Hawks changed the spelling of their name to Black Hawks.

In 1991, lots of teams were beginning to be added to the NHL. That year, it started with the San Jose Sharks.

Two new teams joined the league the next season - the Ottawa Senators and the Tampa Bay Lightning.

The next season, another two teams joined the league - the Florida Panthers and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Also, the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas Stars and dropped the word "north" from their name. In the 1995-96 NHL season, the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. The next season, the Winnipeg Jets moved also to Phoenix and became the Coyotes. The season after that, the Hartford Whalers moved to Raleigh and became the Carolina Hurricanes. 

The Nashville Predators joined the league for the 1998-99 NHL season.

For next season, another team joined the league - the Atlanta Thrashers.

The NHL added the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild for the 2000-01 NHL season, bringing the number of teams to thirty. This was the number of teams there were for 17 seasons. The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim changed their name to the Anaheim Ducks in the 2006-07 NHL season. Then, the Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg to become the Jets in the 2011-12 NHL season. Finally, the Phoenix Coyotes changed their name to the Arizona Coyotes in the 2014-15 NHL season.

In the 2017-18 NHL season, the Vegas Golden Knights joined the league. The Seattle Kraken will join the league in the 2021–22 season.

Kingdom of France

The Kingdom of France (; ; ) is the name given to various political entities of France in the Middle Ages and modern times. According to historians, three major events started the Kingdom of France: the advent of Clovis I in 481, the Treaty of Verdun and the election of Hugues Capet in 987. The kingdom lasted until 1792 and was briefly restored in 1814 to 1815 and then from 1815 to 1848.

The King of the Franks, Clovis I, sealed the alliance of Frankish Kingdoms with the Catholic Church at his baptism. That alliance was perpetuated in the Kingdom of France by the crowning of kings at Reims, which made them monarchs by divine right. The first Capetians were anxious to crown their eldest son in their lifetime because their authority was limited in reality to the Ile de France. It was not until Philippe Auguste that their official acts called it the Kingdom of France and that they are able to make a real act of authority throughout the kingdom. Their territory was the feudal fiefs of which king of Western France had been the suzerain since the 843 division of the Carolingian Empire.

The gradual integration of the feudal fiefs into the royal domain required the establishment of a royal administration. Louis IX attached the main importance to its role as justiciary. The "parlement", the high court of justice, was put in place. The Hundred Years' War allowed Charles VII to establish an army and permanent taxes. Richelieu and Louis XIV strengthened the royal authority in the provinces by bringing the local governors of the nobility under their stewardship and by delegating to them stewards appointed by the king.

The tendency of royalty to exercise more and more absolute power could be challenged in times of turmoil, civil wars and the reigns of minor kings. The dispute took a more pronounced character on the occasion of the diffusion of the philosophy of enlightenment and of the values that it carried: government of reason, separation of powers, individual liberties. The French Revolution led to the establishment of a French constitutional monarchy. However, the different formulas experienced failure in 1792, 1830 and 1848, which ended the French monarchy.

It is issued at the discretion of the forecaster composing the watch or warning and implies that there is an enhanced risk of very severe and life-threatening weather, usually a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) a long-lived, extreme derecho event, but possibly another weather hazard such as an exceptional landslides.

Panama Papers

The Panama Papers are 11.5 million leaked documents that talked about financial and attorney–client information for more than 214,488 offshore tax accounts. The documents, some traced back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source to German journalist Bastian Obermayer. 

The documents contain personal financial information about wealthy individuals and public officials that had been kept private. While offshore business tax activities are legal, reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, including fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions.

Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr

The Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr was an anti-tank rifle, of German production, used towards the end of World War I. At the Battle of the Somme, the British first used tanks. The Germans were surprised, and had no weapons (rifles) that could be used against tanks. For this reason, they developed one: The Mauser anti-tank rifle was the first rifle that was able to penetrate the larger shell of a tank. It was used towards the end of WWI. It was able to penetrate 20-25mm of tank shell, at a distance of .

MIMO

MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) is a technology which allows an antenna or multiple antennas to communicate with multiple devices, which minimizes errors and maximize efficiency. The most commonly used MIMO variant is MU-MIMO, which stands for Multiple User-Multiple Input, Multiple Output. In layman's terms, imagine a classroom with one teacher and many students who need help. Since there is only one teacher, it will take the teacher a while to fully help all the students. But if there are multiple teachers, students will get help much faster and better. The same way, a router with MU-MIMO technology will be able to communicate with multiple devices with increased speed and minimal errors.

MIMO technologies are most commonly found in routers, smartphones, laptops, TVs, etc. Wi-Fi, LTE; Long Term Evolution, and many other radio, wireless and RF technologies are using the new MIMO wireless technology to provide increased link capacity and spectral efficiency combined with improved link reliability using what were previously seen as interference paths.

Two researchers: Arogyaswami Paulraj and Thomas Kailath were first to propose the use of spatial multiplexing using MIMO in 1993 and in the following year their US patent was granted.

Cannabidiol

Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the 150+ naturally occurring phytocannabinoids found in certain strains of hemp and in all cannabis plant strains.

CBD is the abbreviated version of cannabidiol, which is one of the leading compound found in hemp plant, as naturally hemp has more CBD than any other compound found in its chemical composition. CBD is a cannabinoid, and due to their relationship with the body’s endocannabinoid system, it is a unique compounds from others, it uses cannabinoids to perform regulatory actions which affect our overall wellbeing.

It is legal in many places and is used in the management and treatment of chronic pain, PTSD, anxiety, anxiety disorder, depression, diabetes type 1, diabetes type 2, seizures, and in conjunction with allopathic approaches to diseases including cancer chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Anecdotally CBD is being used with claimed positive results by patients for almost every illness.

CBD, unlike Δ9-THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol), is a non psycho-active compound of cannabis. Its use and popularity as an alternative to pharmaceutical drugs is growing worldwide despite difficulties, ambiguities and, in some cases, contradictory legal status in some states and countries.

In the USA the consumption of CBD hemp oil is federally legal, since CBD hemp oil falls under the same importation and commerce laws as other hemp products. Some US states have not enacted legislation specifically relating to CBD hemp oil and continue to use high THC cannabis laws to govern the status of CBD. At the same time many states have legislated to legalize or decriminalize cannabis.

Most states have detailed information relating to the legal status of recreational cannabis, CBD, and what is increasingly referred to as 'medicinal cannabis'. up-to-date state specific info can be seen at Legal history of cannabis in the United States (in Notes).

In 1939 Irishman William Brooke O'Shaughnessy introduced cannabis extract to American pharmacies and thus began it's popularity as a remedy. A wide range of cannabis extracts became freely available and could be gotten from travelling doctors, 'snake oil salesmen', and apothecaries across America and Europe.

The general lack of controls and regulation at the time lead to some deaths and injuries linked back to supposed cannabis extracts. Unscrupulous makers produced formulations that were of questionable quality for quick profits and some cases the ingredients were toxic or poisonous. This unfortunate practice was widespread across the profitable field of medicine and remedies.

As result, in 1906, The Pure Food and Drug Act was passed by the United States Congress. It required that certain special drugs, including cannabis extracts, be properly and correctly labeled with contents. Prior to this many drugs were marketed as 'patented' medicines with 'secret ingredients'. The new regulations, however, did nothing to stem criticism about the availability of narcotics in particular and around 1910 there was a new round of legislation aimed to strengthen requirements for their sale and remove 'loopholes' in poison laws.

The 1910 revisions were designed to restrict all narcotics, including cannabis, as poisons therefore requiring a doctors prescription and limiting sales to pharmacies only. The first instance of the 1906 Act was enacted by the District of Columbia in the same year as 'An act to regulate the practice of pharmacy and the sale of poisons in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes'. The act was again updated in 1938 to the Federal Pure Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938 which is still current as of the early 21st century. To date, marijuana remains under this law defined as a "dangerous drug".

CBD as a separate substance or as an ingredient of other products is legal across the USA since it is a hemp extract however when purchasing people should check their specific local and national laws.

Evidence suggests that hemp and cannabis may have been farmed for up to 12,000 years and had many uses including the making of cloth, rope, paper, food, and medicine. However, in the modern context, it was not until its introduction to American pharmacies by William Brooke O'Shaughnessy in 1839 that Cannabis extracts came into mainstream awareness as a medicine. A wide range of cannabis extracts became easily available and could be gotten from travelling doctors and salesmen, doctors, and drugstores throughout America. This ended the introduction of the Pure Food and Drug Act. Similar products were also available across Europe.

In the early decades of the 21st century, CBD is again becoming well known for its qualities as a remedy for health problems. Its world-wide popularity is ahead of the slow process of making it legal to produce, supply, buy, and use cannabis for enjoyment in non-medical settings, and especially when it comes to CBD, which doesn't have a psycho-active component.

There is some experience that CBD has a positive effect in managing and treating chronic pain, PTSD, anxiety, anxiety disorder, depression, diabetes type 1, diabetes type 2, seizures, and also combined with allopathic approaches to diseases including chemotherapy and radiation therapy for treating cancer. No toxic dose for CBD is known, and there is no record from any source of a death or serious injury from CBD as of this writing.

CBD may be useful either as treatment for a specific illness or in a smaller dose for maintenance of good health. Usually, CBD is taken by mouth as oil drops or a powder that dissolves in water, or made into a food to be eaten. Another form of CBD is used on the skin as the oil or a cream to rub in. CBD is popularly taken in the 'vape' method (from the word "vapor"), with the CBD is heated so it can be inhaled. This method is favoured because the effect is felt sooner than by other means. Patients who need long-lasting relief from pain or other symptoms such as nausea, may combine two methods: for example, first vape and then eat a food made with CBD.

Yongle Emperor

The Yongle Emperor (May 2, 1360– August 12, 1424), known in China as , was the 3rd emperor of the Ming part of China's history. He was the emperor of China from 1402 to 1424. He is important because he moved China's capital to Beijing, built its Forbidden City, and sent Zheng He on trips to Indonesia, India, Arabia, and eastern Africa.
The Yongle Emperor's real name was . It is written in Chinese writing. His given name was Di and his family were the Zhus, but Chinese people write their family names first. His name means "Japanese cherry", but in Chinese that bush or tree isn't thought of as Japanese.

In old China, the Chinese emperors did not number their years from one place. Instead, they gave names to eras (groups of years) any time they wanted. Some emperors made 10 or more eras while they led China. Zhu Di started his era the year after he took Yingtian (now Nanjing) from his nephew the Jianwen Emperor in 1402. He said this was the 1st year of the "Era of Eternal Happiness", which sounds like "Yǒnglè" and is written in traditional Chinese writing and in the easier writing now used by the PRC. He only had this one era when he was emperor, so people also called him the "Emperor of the Yongle Era" or "Yǒnglèdì" ( or ).

When he was the emperor of China, Chinese people just called him the "Emperor". If they met him, they used very polite terms like "Bìxià" (, "Your Highness") to speak to him. After he died, the next emperors gave him a new, long, and very polite name and called him "Míng Chéngzǔ" (), the "Most Successful Dead Family Member" of the Ming. After the Xinhai and Communist changes in government of China, people are less polite when they talk about the old emperors. They usually just call him by his everyday name Zhu Di like a common person. In English, it's more common to talk about him as the Yongle Emperor.

Zhu Di was born on May 2, 1360, during the Yuan part of China's history. His father Zhu Yuanzhang was a successful leader of the Red Turbans fighting the Yuan army to change China. People don't agree about who his mother was. In the histories written by the later Chinese governments, his mother was the Empress Ma, his father's most important wife. Other people—especially people who did not like Zhu Di—said that his mother was one of Zhu Yuanzhang's live-in girlfriends and wasn't even Chinese. They said that he changed all the papers about his real mother after he got more power.

Zhu Yuanzhang won his fight with the Yuan and became the Hongwu Emperor of China in 1368. He called his new government the Ming. The Ming had rules about who should be the new emperor when the old emperor died. Zhu Biao () was Zhu Yuanzhang's oldest son and people thought he would be the next emperor. Zhu Di was only the 4th son, so people did not think he would become the next emperor. He was still very important, though. The Hongwu Emperor made him the leader of Beiping (today's Beijing and the area around it).

Zhu Biao died before the Hongwu Emperor. When the emperor died, the Ming's rules said that Zhu Biao's son Zhu Yunwen () should be the new leader. He became the Jianwen Emperor in 1398 at the age of 22.

The Jianwen Emperor's many uncles were very powerful, almost like kings. He started to take away their power right away. One was sent away to Yunnan, one killed himself, three were made into common people. Zhu Di was afraid and pretended to be crazy. The Jianwen Emperor was less afraid of him and even let Zhu Di's three sons—whom he held in Yingtian (now Nanjing) to be sure of Zhu Di's good behavior—go to Beiping (now Beijing) to visit their "sick" father before his death. 

With his sons free, Zhu Di began to fight the Jianwen Emperor. At first, he said that he really wanted to protect his nephew from the "bad helpers" who were telling the emperor to fight his own family. After he took the capital, though, he rewrote all the government papers to pretend the Jianwen Emperor had never been the emperor. The four years of his nephew's control were dated to the end of the Hongwu Emperor's era. Zhu Di began his new era at the next Chinese New Year and became the Yongle Emperor.

Many people in the government of China said they did not like the Yongle Emperor and that he should not be the country's leader. A body was shown and said to be the Jianwen Emperor's, but it was badly burnt and no one could be sure it was really him. Some people said that the Jianwen Emperor was still alive and that he was hiding as a Buddhist monk. All of this made the Yongle Emperor very worried and angry. He did not stay in Yingtian or make it his capital. He left some of the government there but moved most of it to his home in Beiping. Because China now had a more important northern capital and a secondary southern capital, these two cities came to be known as Beijing and Nanjing. The Yongle Emperor's new, larger home in Beijing grew into the Forbidden City. The Yongle Emperor killed many of the angry government leaders in Nanjing. Sometimes he killed their families. Sometimes he killed their families, friends, and students. 

Many of these troublemakers were the people who took power because of their high scores on the imperial examination. The Yongle Emperor gave more power in his government to his eunuchs, men who had been hurt as children to stop them from being able to have children of their own. One of these men was Zheng He, an Islamic leader who led great treasure ships south from Suzhou and Nanjing in 7 big trips between 1405 and 1433. The first trips may have been looking for the Jianwen Emperor, but they also became trips that taught China about the South China Sea and Indian Ocean and opened up more buying and selling between their countries and China.

The Yongle Emperor died on August 12, 1424, and was followed as emperor by his oldest son Zhu Gaochi, who became the Hongxi Emperor.

Mountain weasel

The mountain weasel ("Mustela altaica"), is a type of weasel. It is also called the pale weasel, Altai weasel or solongoi.

Males are about 12.5–17 in (320–630 mm) long. Males can weigh 8–12 oz (230–340 g). Females are a little bit smaller. They are 12–15 in (309–377 mm). Females weigh about 4–8 oz (110–230 g). The summer fur is gray to gray-brown fur with some light yellow. The winter fur is more of a dark yellow with some brown. In both seasons, the underbelly is pale yellow to creamy white.

This weasel lives in high-altitude environments, and also on rocky tundra and grassy woodlands. This weasel rests in rock crevices, tree trunks, and abandoned burrows of other animals or the animals it previously hunted. The home range size of this animal is currently unknown.

Geographical distribution for this species lies in parts of Asia from Kazakhstan, Tibet, and the Himalayas to Mongolia, northeastern China, southern Siberia, Korea, and also some parts of Russia. The most common area for this species, however, is Ladakh, India.

Overall, these animals are thought to be live by themselves except when mating. The mountain weasel breeds once a year. Males fight for the females. The mountain weasel usually mate in February to March, and the young are usually born in May. The gestation period is 30–49 days. The mountain weasel gives birth to one to eight young ones. The young ones are blind, and their fur is not well developed. Lactation lasts about two months. After weaning, the young become independent but they still live with their brothers and sisters until fall. Young are able to breed in the next season when they are just under a year old.

The mountain weasel is able to climb, run, and swim. Their long bodies and short legs allow them to be very agile. Mountain weasels are generally nocturnal, but may hunt during the day. Even though they live by themselves, they communicate with each other visually and sound. This animal has very good eye sight. They also communicate by sound to warn off predators, to protect their territories, and when mating. When scared, they make a loud chirring sound and excrete a very smelly odor.

Mountain weasels are carnivores. They mainly feed on pikas and voles. They have an important ecological role in controlling the population of the voles. Muskrats, rabbits, ground squirrels, small birds, lizards, frogs, fish, and insects are also eaten.

Some of the threats that makes the weasel to be near-threatened include habitat change, mainly caused by human development. Other dangers, such as traffic on roads, can reduce their population. Overgrazing by cattle, goats, and sheep causes the prey of the weasel to decrease because their hiding spots and food are reduced.

The conservation status, according to the IUCN, is "near threatened" because it is considered to be in a significant decline. It requires monitoring mainly because of habitat and resource loss.

Yoweri Museveni

Yoweri Kaguta Museveni (born 15 September 1944) is a Ugandan military officer, politician and revolutionary who is the 9th and current President of Uganda since 1986. He is considered autocratic. After Museveni lost the election of 1980, he started the Ugandan Bush War which caused over 100,000 deaths and led to the removal of Milton Obote.

Museveni is well known for being anti–democracy and as well as anti–homosexuality. He is one of Africa's longest serving leaders. His rule had brought many changes in Uganda. Museveni was a very strong believer of dictatorship and absolutism that in 2005, he scrapped presidential term limits in Uganda and the presidential age limit in 2017.

On 16 January 2021, Museveni was re-elected for a sixth term with 58.6% of the vote, despite many videos and reports that show ballot box stuffing, over 400 polling stations with 100% voter turnout, and human rights violations. As of 2022, after 36 years of his authoritarian rule, Uganda has been ranked 166th in GDP (nominal) per capita and List of countries by 167th by Human Development Index.


History of genetic engineering

The history of genetic engineering started around 12,000 BC. At the time, humans tried to domesticate animals. 

The first artificial genetic engineering occurred in 1972. Two scientists named Herbert Norman Cohen transferred DNA then. In 1983, the first tobacco plant was created using genetic engineering. A gene that resisted antibiotics was introduced to the pl ant. 

Officially, genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of the genome with techniques developed in the 1970s. Without technology, genetic engineering has occurred in ancient times. It was through domestication and artificial selection that plants and animals were engineered. It is believed that the dog is the first domesticated animal, most likely from wolves. 
Development of genetic engineering allows scientists to study diseases.

Next of kin

A person's next of kin (NOK) is that person's closest living blood relative or relatives. Some countries, such as the United States, have a legal definition of "next of kin". In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, "next of kin" may have no legal definition and may not necessarily refer to blood relatives at all.

In some legal systems, rights regarding inheritance (which imply a decision-making capacity such as in a medical emergency in which no clear will or instructions have been given, and the person has no spouse) flow to the closest relative (regardless of the age, with a representative appointed if a minor), usually a child, a parent or a sibling. However, there are people without any close adult relatives and, in such a case, decision-making power often flows to a niece or nephew, first cousin, aunt or uncle, or grandparent.

For example, if a person dies intestate, the laws of some jurisdictions require distribution of the estate to the deceased's spouse or children. However, if there are none of them, the estate can often be distributed to the next closest group of living relatives, whether they are parents, grandparents, first cousins, aunts and uncles, or second cousins in extreme cases. If a person dies intestate with no identifiable next of kin, the person's estate generally escheats (i.e., legally reverts) to the government.

In cases of medical emergency, if a person is incapable (because of age or mental infirmity, or they are unconscious) of making decisions for themselves and they have no spouse or children, the next of kin may participate in medical decisions made by medical personnel, subject to the specific laws of the jurisdiction.

The inability of persons who are not in a legal marriage to make decisions with respect to the care of a live-in partner has resulted in many jurisdictions giving live-in partners rights equivalent to a spouse in such situations, even though most jurisdictions still do not require non-spouses to be made beneficiaries of estates (it is improper in most jurisdictions to disinherit a spouse). The inability of same-sex partners to have rights with respect to a partner's medical care or funeral arrangements over and above those of the next-of-kin is one of the main reasons behind litigation to require same-sex marriage or its equivalent.

For the purposes of next of kin, adopted children are treated as blood relatives. However, relatives by marriage are never considered next of kin.

Letter case

Letter case is the difference between uppercase/capital letters and lowercase letters for certain writing systems. The name comes from letters on a printing press, where uppercase letters were stored on top of the lowercase letters in a drawer. Their formal names are "majuscule" and "minuscule" in the same order. Writing systems that have letter case include the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, and the Cyrillic alphabet.

When the first alphabets were made, they only had capital letters. Overtime, especially during the Middle Ages, lowercase letters were made to write more quickly. Other than Greek and Latin, European languages made no clear differences between capital and lowercase letters until the year 1300.

Different languages have different rules for when to capitalize or not to capitalize letters. For example, German always capitalizes nouns, while English only capitalizes proper nouns, so while German would write "the automobile" as "das Auto", English would not do the same. However, nearly all languages with letter case capitalize the first letter of the first word of every sentence.

People's Party (United States)

The People's Party (also known as the Populist Party) was a left-wing political party in the United States.

The party wanted direct election of senators, government ownership of the railroads, telegraph and telephone systems, price support for farmers, a graduated income tax, unilimited silver coinage, an 8-hour work day and more propositions and referendums.

The party was formed in 1891 after a series of conferences involving the leaders of a few agrarian organizations.

The Populists were very popular among farmers in the southwest and Great Plains. The party nominated James B. Weaver as their presidential candidate for the 1892 election, and he would later receive 8.5% of the popular vote and win 5 states. In the 1896 presidential election, the party nominated Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan, who supported many of the Populist ideas. To separate themselves from the Democrats, they nominated Thomas E. Watson as their vice-presidential candidate, instead of Democrat pick Arthur Sewall. During this election, the populist party slowly began to merge into the Democratic party. Bryan would later lose the presidency to Republican William McKinley.

He received 0.10% of the popular vote, or 78,759 votes. In the 1976 election, the party nominated Margaret Wright, and Benjamin Spock ran as her vice-presidential running mate.

Diorite

Diorite ( ) is an melted rock that has cooled made mostly of the silicate minerals (materials made of silicon and oxygen). Diorite is between basalt and granite. Diorite is usually grey to dark-grey in color, but it can also be black or bluish-grey, and often has a greenish cast. It is distinguished from gabbro (basalt) because the material in diorite has more sodium and less calcium. Diorite may have small amounts of quartz, microcline, and olivine. Tiny amounts of muscovite may also be found. If there is a lot of quartz it makes the rock type "quartz-diorite" (>5% quartz) or tonalite (>20% quartz).

Diorite has an often speckled texture of coarse grain size.

Diorites may be associated with either granite or basalt intrusions, into which they may merge. Diorite results from the partial melting of a rock above the area where two tectonic plates merge under each other. It is commonly produced in volcanic arcs, and in cordilleran mountain building, such as in the Andes Mountains, as large batholiths. The extrusive volcanic equivalent rock type is andesite.

Diorite is a relatively rare rock. It is found in Leicestershire (one name for microdiorite—markfieldite—exists due to the rock's being found in the village of Markfield) and Aberdeenshire, UK; Guernsey; Sondrio, Italy; Thuringia and Saxony in Germany; Finland; Romania; Northeastern Turkey; central Sweden; the Darrans range of New Zealand; the Andes Mountains.

After a successful career on stage in his early years, he acted in movies from the 1930s to the 1970s, and then, giving up movies, he went back to his first love, the stage.

Radha was a popular theatre artist who performed in more than 5000 stage shows. Starting at the age of 10, he appeared at first in small roles and eventually grew to a level that stories for dramas were custom made for him.Radha gained popularity with the success of his stage play "Ratha Kanneer". His performance in the 1954 movie version of the play, directed by Krishnan-Panju, brought wider recognition of his talents and made him a household name in Tamil Nadu.

Radha played both villain roles and comedic roles. After the 1950s, filmmakers created roles specially for him, and he often overshadowed even main actors like MGR and Sivaji Ganesan. He was an active member of the Self-Respect Movement, and was known for his atheistic views. Towards the end of his career, however, he started acting in Hindu devotional movies like "Velum Mayilum Thunai" but he often used to ridicule theism in these movies.

As majority of the evidences were against Radha, he was sentenced to a seven-year term. At the High Court hearing, considering his age, the sentence was reduced to three and a half years.
After being released from jail, Radha died of jaundice on 17 September 1979 aged 72 at his residence in Thiruchirappalli. His popularity had improved and his funeral procession was one of the largest in South India, as over 200,000 mourners paid respect.

Dhanalakshmi Ammal) and M.R. Radharajoo.

IPhone SE (1st generation)

The iPhone SE is a smartphone made by Apple Inc. It was released on March 31, 2016. It has almost everything the iPhone 6S has but in the body of an iPhone 5S. It does not have 3D Touch or a barometer. However, just like the iPhone 6S, it has an improved Apple A9 system-on-a-chip, an improved battery, and an improved camera that can record 4K video.

Along with the iPhone 6S and the iPhone X, the iPhone SE was discontinued by Apple on September 12, 2018. The iPhone SE currently does not have an upcoming model based on the original iPhone SE. "Business Insider" wrote that "Apple made a big mistake by removing its smallest and most affordable iPhone from its lineup", suggesting that the company was ignoring customers who are worried about the loss of a smartphone type that is both affordable and small enough to be comfortable to use. "Quartz" reported that women and other smartphone users with small hands get sore hands from holding large smartphones. The technology website "Gizmodo" was also concerned that Apple discontinued the iPhone SE, hoping that "there will be a return to smaller phones", as well as hoping that people will be able to hold a phone "in a single hand, and be able to use it fully." 

Earlier iPhones, the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, had much larger screens. However, there are a significant number of customers who would prefer to use a smaller 4-inch screen size of the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5S. 

Apple stated in the "Let us loop you in" event on March 21, 2016 that they sold over 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015. In this event, they proved that many customers wanted smaller phones. Later in the event they presented the iPhone SE, describing it as "the most powerful 4-inch phone ever." 

The iPhone SE, iPhone 6S, and iPhone 6S Plus were the last iPhones to feature the standard 3.5 mm headphone jack.

Along with the iPhone 6S and the iPhone X, the iPhone SE was discontinued by Apple on September 12, 2018.

The iPhone SE looks almost identical to the iPhone 5 and 5S, except the iPhone SE has got rounded edges and a stainless steel Apple logo on the back. Cases designed to fit the 5 and the 5S will also fit an . The iPhone SE is available in the colors Space Gray, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. 

"CNET" was positive about the iPhone SE, considering the iPhone SE to be a "great choice at the small end, with no compromises". "CNET" also praised Apple for adapting the iPhone 6S generation phones into different sizes to increase variety of phone types; the smaller 4.0-inch SE, 4.7-inch 6S, and 5.5-inch 6S Plus. In a later article, "CNET" summarized the iPhone SE to be “the smaller, more pocketable member of the iPhone family. It was Apple's compact, budget option, and its 4-inch screen and tinier overall size were total throwback stuff. Consumers loved the battery life and that it still had a headphone jack.”

"The Verge" considered the iPhone SE to be "a much-improved, well-designed, small phone with great battery life" and a "great upgrade" for customers who currently own 4S or 5S models, noting the device's familiar appearance, high performance (even noting that the small screen is the only problem for multitasking and certain apps), and improved battery life. Giving the iPhone SE an 8.7 out of 10, Goode praised many features of the iPhone SE: "the iPhone SE is not a tiny little engine of innovation. It's today's tech in yesterday's phone body. As with anything, we should be wary of giving too much praise to something that's just doing its job."

"TechCrunch" praised the iPhone SE's design. They mentioned that the phone appealed "not just to the nostalgic and neophobic (fear of new things), but simply people who prefer a smaller phone." The employees who work at TechCrunch do not have "particularly large or small hands, but [they] preferred this highly pocketable, proven design to the new one for a number of reasons", further praising the iPhone SE as the best iPhone that Apple has ever made.

Additional Member System

The Additional Member System is an electoral system used to produce a more proportional result than Plurality voting, also known as First Past The Post. It is sometimes referred to as Mixed Member Proportional but these two electoral systems have different ways of allocating list seats. The term additional member system is almost only used in the United Kingdom but has been used to describe Italy's Electoral system from 1993 to 2005.

In the Additional Member System the voter has two votes ; one vote goes to an local representative or multiple representatives from a geographical electoral district. This is commonly referred as a constituency vote. The other vote goes to a political party. This is commonly referred as a list vote and is to represent the voter in a wider region.

Firstly, the Constituency vote is counted: the votes are counted and the candidate with the most votes, even if the candidate did not reach a majority, wins the seat.

Next, each party's Member Score is calculated using a formula:

formula_1

"V = Party List Vote"

"S = Seat already won"

Once the party's member score is calculated the list seats are given to each political party using the D'hondt formula.

In this Hypothetical Example there is 100,000 voters and there are: 3 political Parties, 10 total Seats (6 constituency seats and 4 list seats).


Italy's Parliament used from 1993 to 2005 used a system which was sometimes called the additional member system but was known as Mattarellum, it had 75% of seats allocated using Plurality voting and 25% of seats used to create a proportional legislature.

Cellular Jail

The Cellular Jail, also known as Kālā Pānī (Hindi for "black waters"), was a colonial prison in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. The prison was used by the British especially to exile political prisoners to the remote archipelago. Many notable dissidents such as Batukeshwar Dutt, Yogendra Shukla and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, among others, were imprisoned here during the struggle for India's independence. Today, the complex serves as a national memorial monument.
The construction of the prison started in 1896 and was completed in 1906. The original building was a puce-colored brick building.The bricks used to build the building were brought from Burma.Each of the seven wings had three stories upon completion. There were no dormitories and a total of 696 cells. Each cell was in size with a ventilator located at a height of .
The name, "cellular jail", derived from the solitary cells which prevented any prisoner from communicating with any other. Also, the spokes were so designed such that the face of a cell in a spoke saw the back of cells in another spoke. This way, communication between prisoners was impossible.
The Empire of Japan invaded the Andaman islands in 1942 and drove out the British. The Cellular Jail then became home to British prisoners. During this period, Subhas Chandra Bose also visited the island. In 1945, the British resumed control with the end of World War II.
Another two wings of the jail were demolished after India achieved independence. However, this led to protests from several former prisoners and political leaders who saw it as a way of erasing the evidence of their persecution. The remaining three wings and the central tower were therefore converted into a National Memorial on 11th February 1979 by then Prime Minister of India Shri.Morarji Desai.

The Govind Ballabh Pant Hospital was set up in the premises of the Cellular Jail in 1963. It is now a 500-bed hospital with about 40 doctors serving the local population.The centenary of the jail's completion was marked on 10 March 2006.

Contribution claim

A contribution claim is a claim made by one or more people in a court case to get money from a person not involved in the case.

In most cases, contribution claims are made like the original claim itself. The claim must be personally given to the new, third party defendant, by the third party plaintiff (the defendant bringing the claim for contribution relief). In contrast, a counter-claim asserts that the party (usually a defendant) is entitled to offset the damages awarded to plaintiff by the proportionate share of any responsibility, liability, or fault assigned to the plaintiff by the jury. Finally, a cross-claim is the same as a counter-claim or contribution claim, except that it is asserted by a defendant against other defendants. Counter-claims and cross claims do not require personal service because no new parties are being added to the claim.

In some state court systems, a contribution claim must be made as a new case, and the person making it must pay a fee. In other states, no extra fee is required.

Lierna

Lierna is a "comune" in the province of Lecco in Lombardy, “the Diamond of Lake Como” in north-west Italy. It lies on the eastern shore of Lake Como in the area Centro Lago. It is about north of Milan and about north-west of Lecco. It has an area of 11.3 km² and has twelve "frazioni": Bancola, Casate, Castello, Cisarino, Genico, Giussana, Grumo, La Foppa, Mugiasco, Olcianico, Sornico and Villa. At the end of 2014 the population was 2176 people, in 983 families. Lierna is the most represented village on Lake Como over the centuries in works of art.

Lierna borders the comunes of 
Bellagio, Mandello del Lario, Varenna, Limonta (Oliveto Lario), Esino Lario, Mandello del Lario.

The first mention of Lierna dates to 854 AD, but Roman remains, including a mosaic floor now in the Palazzo Belgioioso of Lecco, attest to much earlier settlement. The name of the village may be of Roman or of Celtic origin. Between 1035 and 1202 it was a feud of the Monastery of San Dionigi in Milan. Lierna was contested between Milan and Como, and between the Della Torre and Visconti families. It passed into the hands of the Marchesino Stanga in 1499, and in 1533 to the Sfondrati family of Cremona, who held it until 1788. Lierna became a "comune" in 1743, when it was separated from that of Mandello.

In 1927 the Milanese sculptor Giannino Castiglioni opened a studio at his house in Lierna. He died in Lierna on 27 August 1971. He left some preparatory plaster casts to the comune; a museum to house them is under construction.

In 1933 an incomplete fossil of "Lariosaurus balsami", a nothosaurid from the Middle Triassic (circa 240 million years ago) of which the first example was discovered at Perledo, some 10 km north of Lierna, was found in a quarry in the "frazione" of Grumo. It is now in the Museo di Storia Naturale in the Palazzo Belgioioso of Lecco.

The “Centre-Lake Como” (Centro-Lago di Como) spans between Bellagio, Lierna, Varenna, Menaggio, Tramezzina, and the Comacina Island, standing out as the most beautiful and prestigious region across the entirety of Lake Como. This area has been a haven for European nobility, boasting centuries-old possessions.

In the Centre-Lake Como (Centro-Lago), property prices can soar beyond 350,000 euros per square meter, drawing parallels to the opulent Costa Smeralda. George Clooney himself likened Lierna to “like Monte Carlo,” emphasizing its exclusive allure.

Lierna shares borders with the municipalities of Bellagio, Varenna, Oliveto Lario, Esino Lario, and Mandello del Lario, enhancing its strategic and picturesque location within the enchanting Lake Como landscape.


The highly coveted luxury locale is the central region of Lake Como, offering breathtaking views from the iconic tip of Bellagio to the picturesque expanses encompassing Tremezzo, Griante, Menaggio, Lierna, Fiumelatte, and Varenna.

Apartments in this sought-after area command prices ranging from 5,000 to 7,000 euros per square meter, with select penthouses fetching as much as 25,000 euros per meter. Non-independent villas typically range between 10,000 and 15,000 euros, while independent villas with lake views can exceed 25,000 euros per square meter. For rentals, a space of 80 square meters may incur costs of up to 7,500 euros per month, excluding condominium fees.

Lake Como has evolved today into a super-exclusive neighborhood of Milan, embodying opulence and sophistication in its real estate landscape.

Team Fortress Classic is a team online multiplayer first-person shooter video game made and sold by Valve.

In Team Fortress Classic two teams battle each other, with each team member having access to nine types of character.

Asiago

Asiago is a mountain town in the Northern Italian alps and the birthplace of the world-famous Asiago cheese. The town is located on a plateau at an altitude of 3800 feet (1000 meters) and has a population of more than 6000 people. Asiago is also known as the site of a major battle during the first World War and is home to a war memorial and observatory. Its current economy is based on farming, dairy production and tourism. Roads connect Asiago to the cities of Verona, Venice and Trento and their international airports.
The town of Asiago is located at an altitude of 3280 feet (1,000 meters), and it covers an area of 1.8 square miles (2.95 Km2). Asiago is the largest city on its plateau. The land is flat with low hills, and it’s surrounded by the Brenta and the Astico rivers. The land is covered by forests or it is used as pasture.
The temperature varies from 25 °F to 71 °F (-4C to 21C). The warmer season is between June and September with an average daily high temperature around 64 °F(18C). The cold season is from November to March, with an average daily high temperature below 43 °F(6C). Most of the snow falls between November and April with an average snow depth between 0.1 and 0.4 inches.
Humans were present in the area since Paleolithic times. Inside of local caves, evidence of the presence of first settlers, such as weapons, stone tools and cave painting, have been documented.
In the following centuries, the plateau became the settlement for different peoples like Bavarians, Scandinavians and Cimbri. These different cultures have left their signs in the local language and traditions.
Asiago and the six other towns on the plateau formed an alliance and shared a common government between 1310 and 1807. The alliance was an autonomous state and an ally of the Republic of Venice. After 1807, Asiago became part of the Republic of Venice and then of the Italian kingdom.
During World War I (1915-1918), the plateau was the place of many battles between the Austro-Hungarians and Italians.
The deadliest battle took place on the 15th of May 1916 and lasted for two weeks. For the first time on the Italian front, the Austro-Hungarian army used toxic gas. The battle caused the deaths of 15,000 Italian and 10,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers. The civilian population of Asiago was evacuated and the town was destroyed as the result of heavy bombing. After the end of the war, some of the original population returned to Asiago and rebuilt the town.
The famous American writer Ernest Hemingway spent time in Asiago during the first World War as an ambulance driver. In 1922, he wrote a poem inspired by this experience and called “Arsiero, Asiago”.
The traditional economy was based on farming and on the use of other natural resources taken from the forest. More recently this has been replaced by the year-round tourism industry and by small manufacturing and food processing factories.

Asiago offers many outdoor activities such as hiking and skiing. There are 500 km of ski slopes and 260 km of biking trails (the Plateau Grand Tour). Many tourists are also attracted by the opportunity to taste local foods and visit historical sites from the first World War. Since 2003, the number of tourists has been decreasing every year. In 2015, 174,139 tourists visited Asiago.
Asiago is the birthplace and the place of production of Asiago cheese. Production dates back to the 11th century. During the first World War the method of production was changed in order to feed the growing number of soldiers present on the plateau. This led to the development of the modern version of Asiago cheese, which is now popular around the world. The town of Asiago is the fifth major site of cheese production in Italy, exporting primarily to Switzerland and the United States. The production and origin of Asiago cheese are established under European union rules and guaranteed by a P.D.O. (protected designation of origin) label.
In 2016, the population of Asiago was 6,426. Following a common trend in Italian mountain communities, the population has decreased in number and has become older in age in the last few decades.
Asiago is connected by road to the cities of Vicenza, Trento and Bassano. Regular bus services connect Asiago to near towns and cities. The closest international airports are the ones of Verona and Venice. Asiago is also the site of a small airfield, which is a popular destination for flying in from Northern Italy, Southern Germany and Southern Austria.
The observatory of Asiago is home to the largest optical telescope in Italy, and it is operated by the University of Padua. It was built in 1942, and it’s located at an altitude of 3428 feet (1.045 meters).

The Asiago War Memorial is a monument containing the bones of about 60,000 Italian and Austrian-Hungarian soldiers who died on the plateau during World War I. It was built in 1936 and opened by Mussolini in 1937. It is still an important national crypt and the place of official national celebrations.

The town hall was rebuilt in 1929 after it was destroyed during the first World War. It is made of white and red marble and decorated with Murano glass and mosaic. Its tower houses a 1600 kg bell that is 139 cm in diameter.

Forte Interrotto is a fort overlooking the town. It was built in 1887 at an altitude of 4566 feet and was originally used as military barracks. During the first World War, it became a fortress and was occupied by Austro-Hungarian forces on the 22th of May 1916. Its ruins are now a popular hiking destination.

Privacy

Privacy is the ability to choose what information or personal data is hidden and who it's hidden from.

Privacy laws in many countries give the right not to be unfairly subjected to invasions of privacy. 

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that privacy is a human right.

Everyone wants to keep things about them private.

Some people want to keep their religion, sexual orientation, and opinions private so that they don't get in trouble with their government, the people they know, or both.

Many things on the internet are tracked and sometimes sold by different groups of people. 

For example:


The senders of an email can track the time you open an email using pictures that sometimes can't even be seen.

Emmy Noether

Amalie Emmy Noether (23 March 1882 – 14 April 1935) was a mathematician from Germany who studied abstract algebra. She studied mathematics at the University of Erlangen, and then joined the faculty at the University of Göttingen.

Her main area of research changed over time. From 1908 to 1919, she studied algebraic invariants and number fields. Her work on "Noether's theorem" has been called "one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics". From 1920 to 1926, she developed the theory of ideals in commutative rings. From 1927–35, she published works on noncommutative algebras and hypercomplex numbers. In addition to her own publications, Noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several lines of research published by other mathematicians, even in fields far removed from her main work, such as algebraic topology.

When a child is an infant, parenting involves providing food, comfort and cleaning, and allowing the infant to sleep. As infants cannot talk, this requires the parents to watch the child closely and to help the child learn language.

As the infant grows, parenting involves guiding and teaching the child. Parents establish habits such as brushing teeth and teach etiquette to behave in society.

Din Tai Fung

Din Tai Fung is a chain restaurant founded in Taiwan, best-known for its xiaolongbao, a type of steamed dumpling. In 1972, Din Tai Fung started selling xiaolongbao and soon began to expand. The restaurant is recommended by the New York Times and the Michelin Guide. Din Tai Fung’s branches have spread around the world along with its business philosophy.

Din Tai Fung was originally a retail cooking oil business founded by Yang Bing-yi in 1958. Din Tai Fun got its name from Heng Tai Fung, the cooking oil company where founder Yang previously worked, and Din Mei oil, the oil supplier of Yang’s business. In 1972, as a result of the unsuccessful cooking oil business, half of the Din Tai Fung oil shop was turned into a restaurant where Yang and his wife started selling steamed dumplings, xiaolongbao. Gradually, Din Tai Fung’s xiaolongbao business made a bigger profit than its cooking oil business, so the founders decided to close the oil business and focus on the restaurant business. Din Tai Fung was then enlarged to a 300-seat restaurant. The restaurant is originally located on Xinyi Road in Taipei City and could sell 4,000 pieces of xiaolongbao a day.

In 2000 Din Tai Fung was turned into an incorporated company by its CEO, Yang Ji-hua, son of Yang Bing-yi. Din Tai Fung’s management team was formed and a central kitchen was established. Later, Din Tai Fung’s franchise rights were offered to some overseas companies such as The Breadtalk Group and The Moment Group. Now Din Tai Fung is a chain restaurant company that operates branches around the world.

Since the opening of its first restaurant in Taiwan, Din Tai Fung’s aim has been to keep control of its food and service quality and make sure customers around the world have the same food experience every time they visit. Din Tai Fung requires all of its franchises to follow its business model. The company rejected several franchising requests because of concerns about not meeting its standards in its branches. The restaurant not only standardizes its recipes, but also focuses on training its staff in order to offer the same service in every branch. Customers are able to watch the chefs make xiaolongbao in the kitchen through a glass window, and Din Tai Fung does not advertise.

Din Tai Fung serves cuisine that originated in the region of Shanghai, and its most famous dish is a type of steamed dumpling called xiaolongbao. Din Tai Fung has very precise standards for making xiaolongbao. The dough and fillings of the xiaolongbao have to be weighed carefully. They must weigh exactly 21g, with 5g of dough and 16g of filling. Din Tai Fung’s xiaolongbao must have eighteen folds. After doing a lot of testing, the chefs found that the eighteen folds give xiaolongbao the best texture and also the best appearance.

Din Tai Fung also serves other Shanghai cuisine such as dumplings, buns, fried rice, wontons and noodles.

Din Tai Fung’s original restaurant in Taiwan was founded in 1972. Since then, Din Tai Fung has established 119 branches in 15 countries. These countries include Taiwan, Japan, the United States, mainland China, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Macau, UAE, United Kingdom and the Philippines.

In 1993, Din Tai Fung was listed as one of the top ten restaurants in the world by the New York Times, which made it well-known on the international stage. After opening its first branch in Japan in 1996, Din Tai Fung gained more international recognition. In 2010, Din Taig Fung’s Silvercord branch in Hong Kong received the restaurant’s first Michelin Star, and it was awarded a Michelin Star for the next three years. In 2013, CNN rated Din Tai Fung as the second best franchise in the world for travelers because of its xiaolongbao.

Rajinikanth is an Indian actor who has appeared in over 150 films, predominantly in Tamil cinema. He began his film career by playing antagonistic and supporting roles before graduating to a lead actor. After starring in numerous commercially successful films throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he has continued to hold a matinée idol status in the popular culture of Tamil Nadu. Writing for "Slate", Grady Hendrix called him the "biggest movie star you've probably never heard of." Rajinikanth has also worked in other Indian film industries such as Bollywood, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Bengali.

He made his cinematic debut with K. Balachander's 1975 Tamil drama "Apoorva Raagangal", in which he played a minor role of an abusive husband. He had his first major role in Balachander's Telugu drama film "Anthuleni Katha" (1976), and got his breakthrough in Tamil with "Moondru Mudichu" (1976)—also directed by Balachander. His style and mannerisms in the latter earned recognition from the audience. In 1977, he acted in 15 films, playing negative characters in most of them, including "Avargal", "16 Vayathinile", "Aadu Puli Attam" and "Gaayathri". He had positive roles in "Kavikkuyil", the Kannada film "Sahodarara Savaal", and the Telugu film "Chilakamma Cheppindi", in which he played the protagonist for the first time in his career. His role as a failed lover in S. P. Muthuraman's "Bhuvana Oru Kelvikkuri" (1977) won him critical acclaim. In 1978, he was cast as the main lead in the Tamil film "Bairavi". The same year, he received critical acclaim for his roles in "Mullum Malarum" and "Aval Appadithan"; the former earned him a Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for Best Actor. He made his Malayalam cinema debut with I. V. Sasi's fantasy drama "Allauddinum Albhutha Vilakkum" (1979), an adaptation of a story from "One Thousand and One Nights". By the end of the decade, he had worked in all South Indian languages and established a career in Tamil cinema.

He played dual roles in the action thriller "Billa" (1980), which was a remake of the Bollywood film "Don" (1978). It was his biggest commercial success to that point and gave him the "action-hero" image. Balachander's "Thillu Mullu" (1981), the Tamil remake of the Bollywood film "Gol Maal" (1979), was Rajinikanth's first full-length comedy film. He played triple roles in the 1982 Tamil film "Moondru Mugam", which earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards ceremony. The following year, he made his Bollywood debut with Rama Rao Tatineni's "Andha Kanoon"; it was among the top-grossing Bollywood films in 1983. Muthuraman's "Nallavanuku Nallavan" (1984) won him that year's Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor. In 1985, he portrayed the Hindu saint Raghavendra Swami in his 100th film "Sri Raghavendrar", a box-office failure. In the latter half of the 1980s, he starred in several films in Tamil and Hindi, including "Padikkadavan" (1985), "Mr. Bharath" (1986), "Bhagwaan Dada" (1986), "Velaikaran" (1987), "Guru Sishyan" (1988) and "Dharmathin Thalaivan" (1988).

Rajinikanth continued to act in Bollywood, often playing supporting roles in films such as "Hum", "Khoon Ka Karz", and "Phool Bane Angaray" (all in 1991). Mani Ratnam's Tamil film "Thalapathi" (1991), based on the Indian epic "Mahabharata", earned him critical acclaim. Suresh Krissna's "Annamalai" (1992), P. Vasu's "Mannan" (1992) and "Uzhaippali" (1993) are among his box-office successes in Tamil. He made his debut as a screenwriter with "Valli" (1993), a commercial failure. The Suresh Krissna-directed "Baashha", in which he played a crime boss, was a major commercial success in his career and earned him a "demigod" status in Tamil Nadu. Later that year he acted in K. S. Ravikumar's "Muthu", which was dubbed into Japanese. In Japan, the film grossed a record US$1.6 million in 1998 and was largely instrumental in creating a fan-base for Rajinikanth in the country. "Padayappa" (1999), his second collaboration with Ravikumar, went on to become the highest-grossing Tamil film to that point. In 2002 Rajinikanth produced, wrote and starred in the fantasy thriller "Baba", which fell short of market expectations and incurred heavy losses for its distributors. After a three-year sabbatical, he returned to acting with the comedy horror film "Chandramukhi" (2005); it went on to become the highest-grossing Tamil film to that point, and its theatrical run lasted 126 weeks at a theatre in Chennai. Rajinikanth was paid 260 million for his role in S. Shankar's "Sivaji" (2007), which made him the second-highest paid actor in Asia after Jackie Chan. He played dual roles, as a scientist and an andro-humanoid robot, in the science fiction film "Enthiran" (2010). It was India's most expensive production at the time of its release, and is among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. He played triple roles in the 2014 animated film "Kochadaiiyaan", the first in India to be shot with motion capture technology; it was a commercial failure. Two years later, Rajinikanth played a Malaysian Tamil crime boss in Pa. Ranjith's "Kabali", which had the biggest weekend opening for an Indian film.

Manivannan filmography

S.S. Manivannan (31 July 1954 – 15 June 2013), popularly known mononymously as Manivannan, was an Indian film actor and director. In a career spanning three decades, Manivannan went from being a story and dialogue writer for veteran director Bharathiraja from 1980–82 to a successful director who thrived in experimenting with different genres, before becoming an actor. With over 400 films to his name, Manivannan was one of the most experienced actors in the field and has directed exact 50 films. Manivannan was mainly a supporting actor in films and often played the comedian or the villain's role.

The following is Manivannan's filmography. He has worked as a director, script and dialogue writer and as an actor. Manivannan has acted in over 400 films and directed 50 films throughout his career.



Sino-Korean vocabulary

Sino-Korean vocabulary, or hanja-eo (hangul: 한자어, hanja: 漢子語) are Chinese loanwords in the Korean language. Like Japanese, Korean is unrelated to the Chinese language. Chinese is a Sino-Tibetan language while Korean is a language isolate (meaning that no known languages are related to it), but Chinese has influenced Korean so much that it made many changes to the Korean language. Chinese loanwords make up around 60% of the language's vocabulary, even though Koreans tend to use native Korean words a lot more in everyday speech. This is similar to how around 50% of English words come from Latin, French, or Greek, but English speakers tend to use native English words a lot more. Also similar to Japanese, Chinese serves as one the three main sources for Korean words, the other two being native Korean words and words from other foreign languages, especially English. When some Chinese loanwords changed meanings in Japanese, their meanings also changed in Korean because Korea was a Japanese colony at the time these words changed. Since Koreans were forced by law to speak Japanese and forbidden to speak Korean, the Chinese loanwords adopted the new Japanese meanings when Koreans were allowed to freely speak their own language again.

Since the Korean Peninsula split into two different countries, North Korea and South Korea, the different dialects developed very differently from each other.

Today, South Koreans write using a mix of hangul (the native Korean alphabet) and hanja 漢子 (the Korean version of Chinese characters), although they write using the latter far less than Chinese and Japanese do. Since Chinese words often sound similar to each other even in Chinese, they also became homophones when they came into Korean, but since Korean lacks tones, they sound even more alike in Korean. South Koreans usually write only in hangul, but sometimes when a word has many homophones and the meaning of the word is unclear from context, Koreans sometimes write the word in hanja so that there is no confusion between words. For example, since the Korean word "sudo" (hanja: 수도) has many homophones and can have meanings like "spiritual discipline", "prisoner", "city of water, i.e. Venice or Suzhou", "paddy rice", "drain/rivers/path of surface water", "tunnel", or "capital city", so to avoid confusion about what "sudo" means, these words can be written by their hanja, which are 修道, 囚徒, 水都, 水稻, 水道, 隧道, and 首都. However, Koreans almost never write native Korean words in hanja. For example, native Korean words like "Hananim" (hangul: 하나님, hanja: 神, meaning: God), "mul" (hangul: 물, hanja: 水, meaning: water), "mal" (hangul: 말, hanja: 馬, meaning: horse), "nara" (hangul: 나라, hanja: 國, country), and "saram" (hangul: 사람, hanja: 人, meaning: person) will almost always be written in hangul, even though many of them can be written in hanja. This is different from Japanese, which often writes Chinese characters to represent both native Japanese words and Chinese loanwords.

In North Korea, where Korean nationalism became very strong, hanja and many Chinese loanwords were abolished to "purify" the Korean language, or to get rid of words from other languages and use native words instead. Nowadays, when North Koreans write in Korean, they only write in hangul.

Koreans usually have a one-word family name of Chinese origin and a two-word given name also of Chinese origin. Traditionally, one word in the given name would be the same as all the person's siblings, and the other would be unique to themselves. Examples include Park Geun-hye (hangul: 박근혜, hanja: 朴槿惠) and Kim Jong-un (hangul: 김정은, hanja: 金正恩). Some Koreans, however, have a two-word family name of Chinese origin, like Namgung (hangul: 남궁, hanja: 南宮) and a one-word given name of Chinese origin like in Namkung Do (hangul: 남궁도, hanja: 南宮道). In other cases, Koreans may have a one-word given name and a one-word family name. An example of this is Go Soo (hangul: 고수, hanja: 高洙). Nowadays, however, it has become more common for Koreans to have their given name be a native Korean word, like Haneul (hanja:한을, meaning: "Heaven"/"Sky"), Areum (hanja:아름, meaning: "Beauty"), Iseul (hanja:이슬 "Dew"), and Seulgi (hanja:슬기, meaning: "Wisdom"). On official documents, Koreans must write their names in hanja and hangul. For native Korean names, Koreans chose hanja that just have the same pronunciation as the word's syllables rather than hanja that have the same meaning.

P-value

In statistics, a "p"-value is the probability that the null hypothesis (the idea that a theory being tested is false) gives for a specific experimental result to happen. "p"-value is also called probability value. If the "p"-value is low, the null hypothesis is unlikely, and the experiment has statistical significance as evidence for a different theory.

In many fields, an experiment must have a "p"-value of less than 0.05 for the experiment to be considered evidence of the alternative hypothesis. In short, a low p-value means a higher chance of the null hypothesis being false.

Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory

Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (abbreviated ZF) is a system of axioms used to describe set theory. When the axiom of choice is added to ZF, the system is called ZFC. It is the system of axioms used in set theory by most mathematicians today.

After Russell's paradox was found in the 1901, mathematicians wanted to find a way to describe set theory that did not have contradictions. Ernst Zermelo proposed a theory of set theory in 1908. In 1922, Abraham Fraenkel proposed a new version based on Zermelo's work.

An axiom is a statement which is accepted without question, and which has no proof. ZF traditionally contains eight axioms. Two of these axioms (specification and pairing) are redundant, they can be deduced from the axiom schema of replacement. Nevertheless, these extra axioms are useful; replacement is rarely used for proving theorems in common mathematics.


The axiom of choice says that for any set X, if the empty set is not an element of X then there exists a function f whose domain is X, such that for each element e of X, f(e) is an element of e. For example, given the set formula_14(call it A), the axiom of choice asserts the existence of a function that "picks" exactly one element from each of the elements of A (in this case A has two elements), but it doesn't tell us what combination it is. For finite sets, this axiom can be proved from the other axioms, but not for infinite sets.


Disjoint sets

In mathematics, two sets are disjoint when they have no elements in common. For example, the sets formula_1 and formula_2 are disjoint, but the sets formula_1 and formula_4 are not disjoint.

Power set

In mathematics, the power set of a set "S", written as formula_1 or formula_2, is the set of all subsets of S. In terms of cardinality, a power set is larger than the set it originates from. If "S" is a finite set with "n" elements, then formula_1 would have formula_4 elements.



Second Anglo-Mysore War

The Second Anglo-Mysore War was a conflict that took place on the Indian Subcontinent from 1780 to 1784. The war ended without a clear victory on either side. The Treaty of Mangalore restored the situation to the state before the war broke out. The war involved the Kingdom of Mysore and the British East India Company. The Kingdom of Mysore was a large kingdom, in the South of India. It was an ally of the French. The East India Company was on the side of the English.

Hyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore, committed himself to a French alliance to seek revenge against the British. The British had problems with Mysore because it had an alliance with the French. France was already fighting Britain in the American Revolutionary War and helped Mysore to weaken the British.

The army of Hyder was one of the largest armies in India. In 1780, his army swept down the Eastern Ghats (mountains) and burnt the villages. Hyder set about forming a confederacy against the British. This included the French, the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad. Hyder Ali overthrew the government and established his authority over the Mysore state. Hyder Ali tried to made a treaty with the Marathas and the Nizam of Hyderabad, but both of them decided not to take up arms against the British, so Hyder Ali ended up fighting the war on his own. Hyder died in 1782 but Tipu Sultan proved to be a worthy successor, He introduced many reforms to overhaul and reorganize the administrative machinery. He also modernized the army.

The battle remained indecisive and peace was finally concluded with Tipu on 28 June 1784. The war ended by signing the peace treaty in 1784. The treaty was named as the treaty of Mangalore because the treaty was signed in Mangalore. The Treaty of Mangalore was signed between Tipu Sultan and the British East India Company on 11 March 1784. It was signed in Mangalore and brought an end to the Second Anglo-Mysore War.

The British had problems with Mysore because it had an alliance with the French. The Marathas attacked Hyder Ali and the British signed a treaty saying that they would help Hyder, but they never cared to show up. Between 1773 and 1779 Hyder Ali was expanding his kingdom. To counter the British threat, Nana Phadnavis, the Maratha chief minister at Pune formed an alliance with the Marathas, Mysore and the Nizam of Hyderabad.

Pasty

A pasty is a kind of pastry filled with meat or vegetables and baked, a bit like a pie. They are linked with Cornwall where they were first made.

Pastry dough is rolled out and cut in a circle. The raw filling is placed on half the circle, then the pastry is folded in half over the filling to cover it. The edges are then sealed by crimping (firmly pressed together), and baked. The baking time for the filling and the pastry is the same.

The pasty is made as a single-serving portion, for one person's meal. It's made to be held in the hand and does not need any cutlery. It may be eaten hot, warm, or at room temperature. 

A pasty is portable and convenient to eat. It can be easily be taken to the workplace and kept until a mealtime break. No refrigeration is required if eaten the same day. The sealed, baked dough keeps the filling warm for hours after baking. A pasty could also be reheated by placing on or near a heat source - even by holding over a candle where no oven is available.

Fort Provintia

Fort Provintia is a defense base in Tainan, a city in south Taiwan, built by the Dutch in 1653, and now a historic site.

In 1624, the Dutch colonized southern Taiwan in order to trade with mainland China. Before the fort was built, the place was a center of commercial trade. The fort was built by the Dutch to prevent another rebellion after the local people, led by Guo Huai-yi, went against the Dutch in 1652. The fort was still used as a trade center. The Dutch made the fort with red bricks and mortar, which were a mixture of water, sugar, sticky rice and oyster shells.

In 1662, Koxinga, the ruler of Zheng dynasty,expelled the Dutch, and the fort was used as his government with the new name Chen-Tien Fu. In 1664, the fort was abandoned as a place of government and was used as a place to store gunpowder.

In 1683, the ruler of Zheng dynasty surrendered to the Qing. In 1721, the fort was damaged when Zhu Yigui led uprising against the government. Also through the following years, the fort was destroyed by several earthquakes only a few walls remained. The chief administrator, Sheng Shou Qien, built the Penghu Academy in 1886. It is a Qing style building located at the west side of the fort. In 1879, both the Wunchang Pavilion (Temple of Literature God) and the Hai-She Temple（Temple of Sea God）were built by the emperor’s administrator, Shen Baozhen. The Wunchang Pavilion and the Hai-She Temple are located in the central part of the fort. The Wunchang Pavilion was built in honor of Wun- Chang, God of Literature. The Hai-She Temple was built in honor of God of the Sea.

In 1895, the Qing lost the First Sino-Japanese War and gave away the territory of Taiwan to Japan. The Japanese began to use the fort as an army hospital. In 1944, the Japanese began to restore the buildings including the walls that the Dutch had built, the Hai-Shen Temple, the Wunchang Pavilion and the Penghu Academy.

After WWII, Japan retreated from Taiwan. Then the fort was renamed Chihkan Tower and became an exhibition center. In 1960, the imperial tortoise statues and the stone monuments with historical records from the Great South Gate, part of the original 14 gates of the Tainan City Wall, were moved to the south Chihkan Tower.

Seismic wave

Seismic waves are vibrating movement of the ground. Seismic waves can be caused by underground explosions, volcanic eruptions and man-made explosions that can vibrate the ground. Seismic waves go through the Earth’s layers. The speed of seismic waves depends on the type of materials they meet. When they meet different kind of material, they bounce or go in different directions. Seismic waves can be detected by seismographs.

Seismic waves are caused by earthquakes, underground explosions, volcanic eruptions and man-made explosions that can vibrate the ground. When earthquakes occur, they release energy in a form of seismic waves. Seismic waves make the ground vibrating to all directions from the starting point of the earthquake.

Seismic waves are divided into two main types of waves, body waves and surface waves. Body waves go through the Earth, and surface waves go along the Earth’s surface.

Body waves travel through the Earth’s interior. Body waves are divided into two types, primary waves and secondary waves.

Primary waves travel faster than any other waves, so when earthquakes occur primary waves arrive first at the surface. That’s why we call them ‘primary’.
Primary waves can go through solids, liquids and gases. Primary waves go 7~8 kilometers per second in solids, but primary waves have different speeds in liquids and gases.
The ground moves back and forth in the same direction as the primary waves move. Primary waves repeat squeezing and stretching the ground when they move.

Secondary waves arrive after primary waves. That’s why we call them ‘secondary’. Secondary waves can go 3~4 kilometers per second. Secondary waves can’t go through air and liquids. They can only go through solids. The ground moves up and down in the right angle to the direction of the secondary waves. Secondary waves temporary change the shape of materials.

Surface waves travel along the Earth’s surface. They come after the body waves. Surface waves are caused by primary waves and secondary waves when they arrive at the surface. There are two types of surface waves.

Rayleigh waves were named after John William Strutt Rayleigh. When Raleigh waves travel, the particles move in an oval shape, similar to water waves. The speed of Rayleigh waves depends on the types of solids. Information about Rayleigh waves give us the reason why the ground vibrates. Rayleigh waves are slower than Love waves.

Love waves were named after A.E.H. Love. Particles move back and forth at a 90 degree angle to the wave direction. The speed of Love waves depends on the types of solids. We can know the thickness of the Earth’s crust with Love waves. Love waves usually travel faster than the Rayleigh waves.

Seismic waves can be detected and recorded by seismographs. Primary waves are recorded faster than secondary waves. The period between the arrival time of primary waves and secondary waves is used to find the starting point of the wave. We can know about the Earth’s layer through seismic waves.

Anarcho-primitivism

Anarcho-primitivism is a form of anarchism that is critical of the progress of human civilization. It is considered a form of post-left anarchism.

Henry David Thoreau's work was very influential to early green anarchists. He supported simple living and self-sufficiency among natural surroundings as a way to fight the growth of industrial civilization.

In the late 1800s, anarchist naturism appeared as the union of anarchist and naturist ideas. The movement was influenced by Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy and Elisée Reclus. The movement supported vegetarianism, free love, nudism and an ecological view of the world. Followers viewed nudism as a way of avoiding the artificiality of the industrial modern society. Most of the followers were in Spain, France and Portugal.

Anarcho-primitivists believe that before the widespread use of agriculture, humans lived in egalitarian hunter-gatherer tribes. They believe that after the introduction of agriculture, humans slowly began to become 
obsessed with technology, and divisions of labour began to cause inequality. Primitivists disagree about whether we should return to hunter-gatherer tribes, use permaculture, or both.

Primitivists believe, based on anthropological studies, that hunter-gatherer societies are less likely to have war, violence, and disease. Not all anthropologists believe this, however. A notable example would be Jared Diamond, who believes that tribe-based people are more prone to violence than developed states.

Anarchists are against strong government control, and strive for egalitarian relationships with others. However, Anarcho-primitivists go beyond and apply this to all life, not just human life. Anarcho-primitivists look at the history of human civilization in order to decide how to achieve their goals. They are influenced by the Luddites, and are generally against technology. Anarcho-primitivists appreciate the diversity of life, and believe that humans are damaging it.

Primitivists do not believe that a mass society can be free. They believe that the divisions of labour that these industrial societies produce lead to people relying on factories and other people to make their food, clothing, shelter, etc.; thus, forcing them to be a member of the society.

A common criticism of the anarcho-primitivist movement is hypocrisy. Critics say that while primitivists reject civilization, they usually live civilized lives and use technology to spread their message. Primitivists like John Zerzan say that using technology is a necessary evil for continuing to promote and discuss important conversations.

A notable primitivist, Derrick Jensen, rejects the term "primitivism," believing that it is racist way to describe Indigenous Peoples. He now prefers to be called a "indigenist" or an "ally to the indigenous."

Anarchists Wolfi Landstreicher and Jason McQuinn both criticize the movement as romanticizing exaggerations of Indigenous societies. They also claim that primitivists use the appeal to nature fallacy often. In response, primitivist John Zerzan says that the movement is not romanticizing Indigenous Peoples.

Goliath frog

The goliath frog or giant slippery frog ("Conraua goliath") is the biggest type of frog on Earth. It can grow to 32 centimetres (12.6 inches) long and weigh up to 3.25 kilograms (7.17 pounds). Its natural habitat is western Africa.

In 2019, scientists learned that the frog does something unusual: It digs pools to lay eggs in. The scientists think it is the male frog who digs the pool. Because not all the tadpoles in each pool were the same size, the scientists came to think that frogs lay eggs in the same pool more than once. The frogs move sand, pieces of plants, and stones almost as big as they are. They use the stones and plants to build higher walls for the pool. Scientists saw adult frogs staying near the pools at night to scare away bigger animals that wanted to eat the tadpoles. Scientists think this might be why the goliath frog is so big: Bigger frogs can move bigger rocks, build bigger pools and scare away bigger predators.

Aminoglycoside

Aminoglycosides are antibiotics used for gram negative infections. Gram-negative means that the bacteria which cause the infection don't hold the color of a particular dye (Crystal Violet) when they're tested.

Since they are not absorbed from the gut, they are usually taken by an injection into the vain or muscle but they can be given as a cream or ointment to prevent and treat skin infections, as eye drops for eye infections, as ear drops for ear infections and as a pill for intestinal infections but not for other internal infections.

Antibiotics from this family can be used in patients who are not able to take some regular antibiotics, such as Penicillin because of allergies. The most common Aminoglycosides used as alternatives to Penicillin are Erythromycin (lit. "Red fungus") and Clarithromycin (lit. "Yellow fungus"). They're most commonly used in the treatment of bacterial infections, such as Bronchitis.

Piet Derksen

Piet Derksen (1913, Rotterdam - 24 February 1996, Westerhoven) was a Dutch businessman who founded Center Parcs. He was also a philanthropist. He donated all his fortune to charity.

Piet's father thought he was reading too much, so he said to his son that he should go and play tennis. Pieter listened to the advice of his father, but he was more interested in making money from tennis. He borrowed money from his family and built a tennis court near Kralingen in Holland with it.

Later on, Pieter had the idea to sell his tennis course and start a sport store. It was called "Sporthuis-centrum" which means "Sporthouse-centre". He bought a tent factory in North Brabant. At the time, lots of people wanted bigger, better tents. Pieter decided to rent out tents on a piece of land he bought near Reuver. This was a great success, so the tents were replaced with bungalows. In 1978 Pieter decided to sell his sports stores - he did this so he could concentrate on "Sporthuis Centrum". He built a house for himself on the Center Parcs site "De Kempervennen" near Eindhoven. He did this so he could see his company working and be close to his customers.

Center Parcs Europe

Center Parcs is a group of holiday villages in Europe that was founded in the Netherlands in 1968. It is now two different companies: Center Parcs Europe (CPE), which is run by Pierre & Vacances on mainland European sites owned by Blackstone Group and Center Parcs UK which runs holiday villages in Great Britain and Ireland and is owned by the Brookfield Properties Corporation.

A Dutch businessman, Piet Derksen, started a sport items shop in 1953 at Lijnbaan, Rotterdam. Its name was 'Sporthuis Centrum', which means 'Sport House Centre'. It succeeded and Derksen made 17 more shops in the Netherlands. He then added things used for camping to the range.

In 1968, Derksen bought some woodland near Reuver so that his staff and customers could relax in small tents. The park, De Lommerbergen, worked well so the tents were replaced with bungalows. In 1987, Center Parcs opened its first UK resort at Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire. The brewer Scottish and Newcastle liked the idea - they would buy Center Parcs UK.

In 2001, Scottish and Newcastle sold the Center Parcs UK to venture capitalists Mid Ocean. In December 2003 they sold the UK resorts to Arbor for £285 million. After it was put on the London Stock Exchange in May 2006, Center Parcs UK Group PLC was sold to Blackstone Group. It was changed into a private company. The chief executive Martin Dalby said that the company might make a fifth village. In 2004 it the company said it would be built near Woburn in Bedfordshire. They were not allowed to build it, but later they were allowed to.

Center Parcs in Whinfell Forest was built and run by the Rank Organisation, the only people who had the same service as Center Parcs in the UK. After a few years it was sold to Center Parcs. Whinfell Forest is not built in the same way as other Center Parcs places there are some design differences including the exterior look of the lodges and the Subtropical Swimming Paradise (which is the pools complex) which has been likened to a butterfly shape.

Break prices include accommodation, unlimited use of the Subtropical Swimming Paradise and playgrounds. Meals, bike hire and activities are additional costs.

In July 2016, Center Parcs was allowed by An Bord Pleanála (the Irish group which decides who can build things) to build the first Center Parcs in Ireland. The 395-acre resort will be built in Newcastle Wood, a forest near Ballymahon, County Longford. This is in the Republic of Ireland. The resort will be called 'Longford Forest' and will open in the summer of 2019.

In 2003, Scottish & Newcastle sold the sites on the main part of Europe to Pierre & Vacances (P&V) and DBCP, a German investment group. This was called Center Parcs Europe (CPE). P&V owned a big bungalow-holiday-maker, Gran Dorado Resorts, a Dutch company.

CPE was in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The Dutch government did not like the idea of combining Gran Dorado and Center Parcs, because it would be too big. After agreeing to get rid of some beds, CPE sold all but six Gran Dorado Resorts to Landal GreenParks. Six parks were added to CenterParcs: Loohorst (NL), Port Zelande (NL), Zandvoort (NL), Weerterbergen (NL), Hochsauerland (D) and Heilbachsee (D).

In 2006, after the Blackstone Group bought Center Parcs UK plc, Pierre & Vacances said they would sell all of the CPE sites, if they could still run them. In January 2009, Sunparks was made as well as a Center Parcs in Europe, as a version which did not cost as much.

There are now 26 resorts in the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Germany and the UK. None of the villages are the same. Visitors stay in lodges or bungalows, with trees and bushes around them. Park Zandvoort is different - it is in sand dunes. Some resorts have hotel rooms. The first village had swimming pool, shops and restaurants. A dome was made in 1980. It is called Subtropical Swimming Paradise in the UK. It has a swimming pool in it and other water play areas and pools. It is called 'Aqua Mundo' in Europe. Visitors can do lots of things, like go to restaurants, do activities, visit the spas, and go cycling.

Center Parcs UK and Center Parcs Europe has of 26 resorts and 4 Sunparks. There are six new parks being made.
Three Center Parcs sites were sold because they could not be made bigger. They are now part of Landal Greenparks. They are still used:
These things have different names in Europe and the UK:


Center Parcs UK and Ireland

Center Parcs UK is a company which sells short breaks in five holiday villages in the United Kingdom. Each is about of woodland. The company's first village opened at Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire, in 1987. Its fifth, at Woburn Forest, Bedfordshire, opened in 2014.

Another company runs in the main part of Europe. It is also called Center Parcs, but the two companies are separate. Center Parcs UK became 30 years old in 2017.

In 1968, a Dutch businessman called Piet Derksen bought woodland near Reuver so that workers and customers of his 17 sporting goods shops could relax in small tents. The park, De Lommerbergen, worked well and tents were replaced by bungalows. In 1987, Center Parcs opened its first UK resort at Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. The brewer Scottish and Newcastle liked this idea and they would buy the company.

In 2001 Scottish and Newcastle sold the Center Parcs UK to venture capitalists Mid Ocean. In 2003 they sold the sites in Europe to France-based Pierre & Vacances (P&V), and German investment group DBCP. The companies have the same name but are not the same company.

In December 2003 Mid Ocean sold the UK resorts to Arbor Ltd for £285 million. Arbor put the company on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market. In May 2006 Center Parcs UK was sold to Blackstone Group, and change into a private company. Blackstone changed the name of the European sites to Center Parcs.

In June 2015, it was announced that Blackstone had agreed to sell the company to Canadian-based Brookfield Properties Corporation, for £2.4bn.

The first Center Parcs holiday village in the United Kingdom was opened in July 1987. It was near Ollerton and Boughton in Nottinghamshire and named Sherwood Forest. Two years later a second village was added, at Elveden Forest, near Brandon, Suffolk.

The third park opened in 1994, on the site of Longleat Safari Park near Warminster, Wiltshire. This village has less lodges than Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest because it is very hilly.

In 1997, the Rank Organisation had opened a holiday village near Penrith, Cumbria. They called it Oasis Lakeland Holiday Village. When Center Parcs UK bought it they changed the name to "Center Parcs Oasis Whinfell Forest". The middle of the village is under a roof, and there is no country club like at Elveden Forest and Sherwood Forest. Center Parcs have changed many Whinfell Forest lodges. They have also added new lodges like the ones at the other parks.

In April 2002, the central plaza and sports centre at Elveden Forest was destroyed by a fire. Nobody was badly injured but one man had to be treated because he inhaled smoke. In the summer of 2003, Elveden Forest reopened. Whilst it was closed, the village was rebuilt in a slightly different design. Some lodges were extended and a spa was built.

The chief executive, Martin Dalby, said that the company might add a fifth village. In December 2004, Center Parcs said that it had found a place for it near a town called Woburn, Bedfordshire. The estimated project cost ten years before construction was about £160 million. New lodges, buildings, a pool, a spa and restaurants were built. It was thought that the project would take between three and four years to complete. In September 2007 the company were allowed to build. In 2012 they got £250 million of investment to build the new resort. It would be called Woburn Forest. It is the smallest Center Parcs UK village and opened in spring 2014.

In 2008, Martin Dalby, the chief executive of Center Parcs UK, said that the new village would be the last village the company built in the UK and that if a sixth village was built it would probably be placed in Ireland.

The sixth village was announced in September 2015. County Longford Forest will be in Ireland and is going to open in the summer of 2019.

Each village has different lodge types. These can have between one and four bedrooms. Sherwood Forest has just built a lodge with 6 bedrooms. They can hold up to 12 people. Some big lodges have a games room and hot tub. Lodges are usually in small groups and are quite private. Elveden Forest doesn't have any lodges with one bedroom. It has Lakeside Apartments instead, for one to two people.

In 2007, Center Parcs began updating all of its lodges. All the beds were replaced. A new kind of 'Woodland Lodge' replaced the old simple lodges to become the least expensive place to stay. The Executive Lodges were also upgraded.

Guests can book and take part in a large amount to do at the villages.

Zuni language

Zuni, or Ashiwi, is a language isolate spoken by over 4500 people in New Mexico and much smaller numbers in parts of Arizona. It is now generally considered a language isolate. The Encyclopedia Britannica categorizes it as a Penutian language, and Bertha Dutton once posed the hypothetical that according to the Swadesh list, "If the Zuni language is a member of the Penutian language family, then it is a distant relative of the Tanoan languages (Tewi)." The Penutian Hypothesis was advanced by Alfred Kroeber and Roland B. Dixon and later refined by Edward Sapir, and was an attempt to reduce the number of unrelated language families in a culturally diverse area that was centered in California central coast. While this theory was plausible for some of
the languages, the problem of verification of this theory was that to find any evidence of any cognates between the California languages and Zuni, one would possibly have to trace the languages' lineage by as much as 3000–5000 years or more.

A bibliography of books and articles concerning the Zuni language lists items dealing with syntax and semantics, as does Zuni
Curtis D. Cook's article and the work of Stanley Newman. Others, such as Ruth Bunzel's "Pueblo Pottery" and Jane M. Young's book on Rock Art, are important in the study of pragmatics and the Zuni World View as it is reflected in the Zuni language. The Zuni worldview may properly be considered as a study in orthology.
The form and function of design images and pictographic rock art images and their interpretation according to Zuni mythology
or cosmology sufficed as a form of communication prior to the appearance of a written language.

"The Zuni Enigma", by Nancy Yaw Davis offers a comparative of cognates between the Zuni language and
another language isolate; the Japanese language. While speculative, it demonstrates a likeness between the Zuni and Japanese languages that is more compelling than that of the Penutian Hypothesis. Dell Hymes offers information on California languages where one can form a comparative of certain Zuni words to the languages of California, e.g.Wintu, Maidu, Miwok, and may have relevance to studies of the Pueblo Peoples, the Pecos Classification, and the Hohokam. Also important are the books on and by Frank Hamilton Cushing. He was the first anthropologist to undertake studies by means of the method of Participant observation, and became a member of the Zuni's Priesthood of the Bow during his tenure at the Pueblo from 1879-1884. Of special interest in regard to the Zuni language is his correspondences edited by Jesse Green, and their relevance to the Zuni language as it reflects their world view.



Flag of Bulgaria

tatari shibani
The flag of Bulgaria (, , "zname na Bǎlgariya") is the flag of the European country, Bulgaria. It has three horizontal bands of white, green and red. It was adopted in 1991.

Brahma Kumaris

Brahma Kumaris is a spiritual group that started in Hyderabad, Sindh in the 1930s by Lekhraj Kripalani. The organisation is known because a lot of women are part of it.

They teach that a person should see themselves as a soul and not a body. They think that all souls are good and that God is where all good comes from. They want to create a worldwide understanding based on what they call "soul-consciousness".

In 2008, the group said that they have more than 825,000 people who come all the time, with over 8500 centres in 100 countries.

The Brahma Kumaris began as a small, caste-specific, spiritual community in Hyderabad, Sindh, India in the 1930s. The community was formally established in 1937, as a trust comprised of young women, but its formation can be traced back to 1932. The precursor to modern-day Sindh was Mohenjo-Daro. One of the world’s most ancient cities, it was the cradle of the Indus Valley. Archeological evidence indicates that region held a progressive society, a well-engineered and designed city. Socially there was equality between women and men, and very low rates of crime.

By contrast, in the 1930s in some parts of Sindh many women were in purdah. Even in the contemporary world, some parts of Sindhi society expect women to wear soft shoes so they are not heard, to live behind blinds so they cannot be seen, and to move according to the instructions of a male relative. For some women, even looking at or speaking to a male outside her family is forbidden. These ideas are not native to Sindh but were adopted by Sindh locals upon arrival of Arabian culture. This tension was vibrant during the time of North West India after British colonisation, and just before the partition of India. This was crucial to the development of the Brahma Kumaris.

The founder of the Brahma Kumaris was a successful middle-aged jeweler, Lekhraj Koobchand Kripalani, residing in Hyderabad (in pre-Partition India). He was of the Bhaiband caste and born into a family who were devotees of (1479-1531), a Hindu theologian and philosopher. Vallabhacharya taught Shuddha (pure) Advaita (non-dualism), an interpretation of Vedanta that rejected asceticism and monastic life, suggesting that through loving devotion to God any householder could achieve salvation. This understanding influenced the early teachings of the Brahma Kumaris and may be at the heart of its role as a social reform movement.

The group has made itself different to Hinduism. They see itself as spiritual teachers and not a religion.

The Brahma Kumaris say "Supreme Soul" for God. They say that God will always exist but without a physical presence. He does not go through the repeating birth, death and re-birth. God is seen as perfect.

Brahma Kumaris' members read the which is flute in Hindi. It is read to classes early each morning in most BK centres in the world. It is also available online.

Brahma Kumaris say that a specific lifestyle is good to have control over one's thoughts. But not everyone does everything and selects what they would like to do:

Lot (biblical person)

Lot was a person in the biblical Book of Genesis chapters 11–14 and 19. He moves to Sodom and Gomorrah. He leaves quickly when angels warn him of the coming destruction of the cities, but his wife looks back 'and she became a pillar of salt' (Genesis 19:26) He fathers children with his daughters when they get him drunk. They gave birth to Moab and Ammon.

Lot is the son of Abraham’s brother Haran, son of Terah. After Haran dies, Lot moves with Abraham to Canaan. When Lot’s shepherds argue with Abraham’s shepherds, Lot moves to Sodom because of how rich the place is even though the people are evil. Lot is kidnapped after four kings invade Sodom, so Abraham takes 318 men, goes to war, saves Sodom and rescues Lot.

When The Almighty tells Abraham he will kill everyone in Sodom and Gomorrah to punish them, Abraham asks The Almighty not to do that since there might be 50 good people there. The Almighty tells him that He wouldn’t kill anyone there if there were 50 good people so Abraham asks if The Almighty would destroy them if there were 45. He says He wouldn’t kill anyone there if there were 45 good people. Then Abraham asks what He would do if there were 40 and The Almighty said He would let everyone there live if there were 40. Then Abraham asks The Almighty about if there were thirty good people and The Almighty says He wouldn’t kill anyone there if there were thirty good people. Then Abraham asks the Almighty what He would do if there were 20 and He says he wouldn’t kill anyone in the city at all. Then Abraham asks if there were ten and The Almighty says that if there were 10 good people in Sodom and Gomorrah, He wouldn’t destroy the city at all. So the Almighty sent two angels to pretend to be humans and go to Sodom and Gomorrahto look for ten good people. They meet Lot, who brings them into his house and feeds them matzah. Then the people of Sodom and Gomorrah tell Lot they’ll kill him unless he lets them rape the two men who are with him so Lot tells them to rape his two virgin daughters instead. They break Lot’s door down to kill Lot and his wife and children so the angels make the Sodomites blind and tell Lot that The Almighty is going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because there aren’t 10 good people there. They tell Lot to run away with his family and not look back. Most of Lot’s family doesn’t listen so he runs away with his wife and two daughters. The Almighty sends fire and sulphur to Sodom and kills everyone there and Lot’s wife turns around and looks back so The Almighty turns her into salt while Lot goes to a city called Zoar.

Lot’s daughters thought that the entire world was destroyed so the first of them decided to get Lot so drunk that he wouldn’t recognize her and she could have sex with him and after she did that, her sister did the same thing. The first daughter got pregnant and had a son Moab while the second also had a son, Ben-Ammi. Moab became the ancestor of the Moabites and Ben-Ammi became the ancestor of a nation called the children of Ammon. 

According to Jewish tradition, Lot was bad but The Almighty saved him because of Abraham but according to Christian tradition, Lot was a good guy.

People were forced to live in the ghettos before they went to concentration camps. The areas were very overcrowded and dirty.
