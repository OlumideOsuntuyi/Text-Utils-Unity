Tropical Storm Arthur (2020)

Tropical Storm Arthur was a strong tropical storm. It did not last very long. It also did not take place during the usual storm season. It affected the U.S state of North Carolina in May 2020. Arthur was the first named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane year. With Arthur, 2020 became the sixth year in a row when a tropical cyclone formed in the Atlantic before June, or when the official hurricane season starts. Tropical Storm Arthur came from a big trough that formed on May 14 near Cuba. The early part of the storm system slowly drifted toward Florida through the Florida Strait for two days. Later, it became a depression on May 16 north of The Bahamas. This started the Atlantic storm season. One day later, the system was named "Arthur" and it slowly moved north towards North Carolina. Arthur started to weaken as it moved towards Bermuda.

Tropical Storm Arthur rained on Florida and made high ocean waves. Arthur's outer areas rained and blew strong winds near North Carolina's beaches and caused dangerous rip currents along the southeastern coast of the United States.

On May 12, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first said it was likely a tropical storm would form near Cuba. By May 13, there were more thunderstorms than usual in Cuba, and the NHC said there was a 70% chance of a tropical storm in the next five days.

The NHC named it Tropical Depression One on May 16. They called it tropical because of the way it turned around circularly.

The NHC named the system Tropical Storm Arthur early on May 17 because people on an airplane had measured the wind. They said it was strong enough to be named. Arthur mostly moved north and in the Atlantic Ocean, not too close to the Florida and Georgia. However, Arthur started moving northeast over colder waters. Even though Arthur was moving over cold water, it still became stronger, even though it was smaller in images. As Arthur became stronger, its center moved onto the coast of North Carolina, a few miles southeast of Cape Hatteras. Then Arthur moved away from North and South Carolina, and it started to be less organized. However, the storm continued to become stronger. Early on May 19, Arthur had its lowest air pressure of and its winds were strongest at 60 mph (95 km/h). Six hours later, the storm was no longer tropical. Arthur finally dissipated on May 21, 5 days after it became a depression.

Arthur rained a lot on Cuba on May 15. In some parts of Cuba, there were almost 3 inches in only four hours. The rain damaged homes and flooded streets. Arthur also damaged buildings in the Bahamas, which had already been hit by Hurricane Dorian one year before. Arthur caused floods and blew away tents that people were living in while they were rebuilding their homes. However, Arthur's strongest winds blew over the ocean, where there were no buildings to blow down.

Arthur was not a tropical storm until after it reached Florida. When it was in Florida, it was a system. Still, Arthur dropped a lot of rain and wind on Florida on May 13 and 14. It dropped over 4 inches (101.6 mm) of rain on parts of Florida and a rainfall total of 5.35 in (135.8 mm) fell on May 14, where it was the tenth highest amount of rain for the city ever. Flash flood warnings were created for large portions of Miami-Dade County on May 14. In Miami, streets were flooded from the rain. High-speed winds made officials use gale warnings and special marine warnings across most of South Florida. Seventy people in Volusia County had to be rescued after being caught in rip currents. Three of them had to go to the hospital. Purple and red flags were raised along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina to tell people about the rip currents. Offshore Georgia, 3–6 ft (0.9-1.8 m) waves were seen. Arthur did $112,000 of damage to Florida.

Arthur also went to North Carolina as a tropical storm. On May 16, tropical storm watches were issued from Surf City to Duck (a city) and Pamlico Sound to Albemarle Sound. A day later, these watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings as Arthur moved closer towards the Outer Banks. By late May 17, the water in the southern portion of the Outer Banks had become dangerous. Torrential rainfall occurred as Arthur's outer rainbands were near eastern North Carolina, with of rain falling in Newport, North Carolina within 6 hours, and many other locations recording at least of rain from the storm. Tropical storm-force wind in Cape Hatteras were also recorded. Despite this, the strongest winds were kept off land. This is because Arthur was an llopsided storm. Waves as high as 12.5 ft (3.8 m) were recorded along the coast of the Outer Banks from Arthur. Due to flooding from Arthur, many highways in the Outer Banks and into mainland North Carolina were closed. SpaceX also had to delay the launch of a few Starlink internet satellites because of bad weather from Arthur affecting them. As Arthur moved away from land, warnings were canceled.

In James City County, Virginia, flooding near the ocean was seen in some places. In south New Jersey, Arthur caused floods, even though it was not a tropical storm then. There were also strong winds on the Jersey Shore. Power lines were blown down. On the Atlantic City Expressway and other roads, trees had fallen.

Quebec Act

The Quebec Act was a British law passed in 1774. It was about Quebec in Canada.

Britain ruled Quebec after the French and Indian War. Before that, it had been ruled by France. Most of the white people in Quebec spoke the French language and used the Roman Catholic part of the Christian religion instead of the Church of England part of the Christian religion.

The British Parliament passed the Quebec Act in 1774. It said that French Canadians did not need to say a loyalty oath any more. It gave Roman Catholics more rights. It let the French Canadians use some French laws instead of only British laws.

This made many British settlers in Canada angry because they did not like Roman Catholics. They called the Quebec Act an Intolerable Act.

Yokai Monsters: Along With Ghosts

, also known as Journey with Ghost Along Yokaido Road, is a 1969 Japanese Tokusatsu movie directed by Yoshiyuki Kuroda and Kimiyoshi Yasuda. it is the third in a trilogy of movies produced in the late 1960s, which focus around Japanese monsters known collectively as "yōkai".

Most of the youkai are played by children of the children's theater company in Osaka, following the previous two works.


"Yokai Monsters Along With Ghosts" was released in Japan on March 21, 1969 where it was distributed by Daiei Film.

Set-top box

A set-top box is a small device that adds extra functionality to another media device, often a television. In general, there are different kinds of such devices:


The most important functions of a set top box are media playback (DVD, VHS videos, perhaps interacve as a game console), recording of the data received, and being able to receive data using different channels (for example Satellite TV, TV over internet) or methods (sometimes, signals need to be decrypted first; some people want to watch digital TV on an analogue television).

The evolution of set-top boxes can be traced back to early 1980s, when a cable converter box was required to receive extra analog cable TV channels and convert them to content capable of being displayed on a regular television screen. The cable converter boxes came with a wired or wireless remote control, which helped to switch a channel to a low-VHF frequency for viewing on the TV. Some newer television receivers significantly reduced the need for external set-top boxes but they are still in wide use. Cable converter boxes are sometimes required to descramble premium cable channels and receive interactive services such as pay per view, video on demand and home shopping channels.

Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable talked to Hamilton. They believed he had had an affair but had not committed other crimes. But Monroe made a copy of letters Hamilton's had written to Maria Reynolds and gave it to Thomas Jefferson.

In 1796, James Callendar wrote a book called "The History of the United States for 1796". In that book, he accused Hamilton of speculation and of the affair.

On the Edge of Magellanic Clouds

On the Edge of Magellanic Clouds () is a fiction book, published in 1998. It includes three stories: "On the Edge of Magellanic Clouds" by Andrei Gusev, "Nights after" () by Sergei Aman and "Silent abode" () by Oleg Birukov. These are stories from Russian life at the end of the 20th century.

The story ""On the Edge of Magellanic Clouds"" is, at first look, realism. The Medvedev couple lived together for a considerable part of their lives before perestroika. But in the last decade of the 20th century, the way of life in Russia is changing. Capitalism comes instead of socialism. Yulia, the wife of the journalist Andrei Medvedev, wants well-being in life. She decides that they need to start a radio station. All her thoughts are on it. The radio station will be ready to broadcast soon. 
However, these plans are a figment of her imagination. A strong desire for enrichment makes her mind bifurcated. Her husband Andrei tells about this in the second part of the story. The narrative is similar to tragic realism. However, here the author's voice turns on, again turning the content over. And the story becomes surreal. This twist makes readers think.

""Nights after"" is a little love story. The guy Sergey from the provinces falls in love with the Moscow girl Natasha. She came on vacation to her grandmother in the village. They meet at night on the river bank. He bathes naked. She does not see him in the dark and also strips naked. An uncomfortable situation develops, but as a result they begin to be friends.
However, village hooligans rape Natasha, and they stab him. He ends up in the hospital, and she leaves for Moscow. And after his recovery, he has only a sad memory of this unfinished love.

The story ""Silent abode"" describes the life of ambulance workers in the province. Young Muscovite Anatoly Kiselyov comes there to practice. Doctors are often called to patients. Doctors get into both tragic and funny situations. Stories about them make up the story.

"On the Edge of Magellanic Clouds" is a book with a non-linear storyline. The book covers the time period of earlier nineties of the last century. Some parts of the stories in this book have a mystical component.

The shape of a molecule or ion is determined by the repulsion between the electron pairs surrounding the central atom. 

Valence Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion Theory

- Only the electron pairs arranged around the central atom in a covalent molecule need to be considered 

- Pairs of electrons repel each other and move as far apart as possible 

- Lone pair-lone pair repulsion is greater than lone pair-bonding pair repulsion which is greater than bonding pair- bonding pair repulsion 

- The actual shape of species is determined by the "atoms" attached round the central atom (and influenced by the lone pairs of electrons) 

- All bonds - single bonds, double bonds and triple bonds - take up the same space.

It is in the Megachilidae family of bees, which carry pollen on their underside. It is about 4 cm long and has a 6 cm wingspan.

Wallace's giant bees build communal nests inside active nests of a tree-dwelling termite. This may have hidden their existence even from island residents. The bee uses tree resin to build compartments inside the termite nest, which protects its galleries. Female bees leave their nests repeatedly to forage for resin. The bee's large jaws help to gather resin: the female makes large balls of resin which are held between the jaws. The association of the bee with the termite may be obligate (it must live there).

The Taihō Code was a group of laws in Japan. It was the law during the 700s c.e., which was the Nara period in Japan. Here, "code" means "set of rules."

The Taihō Code had two kinds of laws. It had "ritsu" which were laws about crime and how to arrest people. It had "ryō", which were laws about how to run the government. For example, the ryō said which areas were provinces and who would run them and what things the governors were and were not allowed to do.

The lawmakers who wrote the Taihō Code copied things from Chinese laws. This was the Tang Dynasty in China. But the Japanese lawmakers wrote the Taihō Code to give more government jobs to Japanese noblemen. This was different from the Tang Dynasty laws, which said anyone from any family could work for the government if they took and passed the right tests.

Modern scholars do not have a copy of the entire Taihō Code, but they think it is about the same as the later Yōrō Code.

If the Taihō Code and the Yōrō Code count as the same thing, then they lasted from 702 c.e. until the start of the Tokugawa period in 1232 c.e.

Soon after the conquest in early 1936, the city was improved with many structures, from paved roads to sewage systems. A new urban masterplan was studied for the city, that was approved in 1938 and by late 1940 Addis Abeba (where the Italian were more than one third of the inhabitants) was full of constructions (that were blocked because of WW2).

List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters

This is a list of characters from , an animated television series based on the toyline created by Hasbro. The series features characters and settings developed by Lauren Faust, who sought to create more in-depth characters than the stereotypical "girly" icons used in previous iterations of the franchise.

Hasbro initially hired Faust to create a pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization. Faust said she was "extremely skeptical" about taking the job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys to be boring and unrelatable. She was disappointed that what she thought of the toys at the time was nothing like the animated shows, in which the characters, according to her, "had endless tea parties, giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying". With the chance to work on "My Little Pony", one of her favorite childhood toys, she hoped to prove that "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she incorporated many elements into the show that subverted stereotypes of girls, such as diverse personalities, character flaws and personality disorders, the message that friends can be different and can get into arguments but still be friends, and the idea that girls should not be limited by what others say they can or can not do. Elements of the characters' personalities and the show's settings were based on her own childhood imagination of the ponies' adventures, in part inspired by the animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up, such as "Transformers" and "". Faust still aimed for the characters to be "relatable" characters, using stereotypical "icons of girliness" to broaden the appeal of the characters for the young female audience.

Antinatalism

Antinatalism, or anti-natalism, is a philosophical stance and social movement that gives a negative value to starting life. Antinatalists argue that humans (and sometimes other sentient beings) should stop making kids because it is morally bad. People who believe that making kids is morally good are called natalists. The term antinatalism was likely used for the first time by Belgian author Théophile de Giraud in his book "L'art de guillotiner les procréateurs: Manifeste anti-nataliste". South African philosopher David Benatar has also published books in support of antinatalism.

Negative Utilitarianism is the idea that stopping pain is more important than making people happy. This makes it different from utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is the idea that people should do the most useful thing. The most useful thing in utilitarianism is making people happy. People who believe in negative utilitarianism idea say that making happiness is not needed. Since life has bad things, it is not worth starting. Some supporters of this idea argue that the worst pains in life do not make up for the best moments. This makes life not worth starting because it is too risky.

Realism can support antinatalism. This is because supporters of the idea have evidence showing that most people have an optimism bias. This means that they see the world as better than it actually is.

Religion can support antinatalism. This is because some religious sects (groups) believe creating life traps souls in a bad world. The Manichaeans, the Bogomils, and the Cathars are some of these groups that believe in the idea. Others include the Marcionites, and the Encratites.

Natalists say that making kids is good because most people are happy.

Roper family

House of Roper is one of the most notable English aristocratic families. The family can be traced back to the year 1066 after the Norman Conquest. They resided in Derbyshire. The family members have held hereditary titles such as Baron of Teynham, Baron Dacre of Glanton, and Viscount of Baltinglass.

Thomas Roper is the first member of the Viscount Baltinglass. He is well remembered for being a soldier and peer. He served as a member of the English Royal Army during the rule of James I. His Knighthood occurred on 16th September 1603. He became the key leaser of "Herbert Estates" after ascending to the Monastery in the year 1626 and becoming the Viscount Baltinglass in the year 1627.

In England, Baron Dacre became a British title after its first creation in the year 1321. Lord Hugh Redwald Trevor Roper is one of the most notable titles of Baron Dacre. Lady Alexandra Henrietta Louisa Howard-Johnston, one of the daughters of Field Marshal, was married to Lord Hugh. In the year 1979, Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister, then recommended the title of a life peer for Lord Trevor Roper. He was presented as Baron Dacre of Glanton to the lords' house in Northumberland County on 27th September 1979.

British titles such as the Baron of Teynham were formed in 1616 in England, and it was presented to Sir John Roper, and his son Roper Christopher became the second holder of the title. Interestingly his daughter called Elizabeth Roper decided to marry Baron Vaux of Harrowden, who was the third holder of the title and a son of George Vaux. They were blessed with a son whom they named Edward. He became the fourth holder of the Baron Vaux of Harrowden after being married to Elizabeth Howard, who was the daughter of Thomas Howard, the first holder of the title Earl of Suffolk.

The fact that Sir John Roper was the first nobleman to declare the Kingship of James I makes him to be remembered for the brave act which happened after he was knighted in the year 1616, although several sources indicated that he might have been knighted in the year 1587. The same day, Queen Elizabeth was able to ascend to the peerage with the title Lord Teynham.

Lord William Roper is a notable member who was a representative of the house of the lords and a practicing lawyer. He also summed up as an author, philosopher and chancellor to King Henry VII Tudor. There was an existing relationship between Lord William Roper and Sir Thomas More because Thomas’s daughter Margaret More was married to William Roper.

Before sir Thomas More’s death, he had a close relationship with Lord William Roper. His cause of death was an assassination done by King Henry VIII simply because he failed to convert into the Church of England. Lord William Roper was granted the opportunity to become the Dukedom by King Henry VIII, but he declined with respect to his father-in-law's death and family members. In the year 1616, Lord William Roper and his nephew, John Roper, earned knight honors for their services.

Margaret More also commonly referred to as Margaret Roper and a daughter to Thomas More, is traced back to 1505 and is believed to have met her death in the year 1544. During her tenure, she earned several recognitions, such as being an English translator and author. She was one of the best-educated female learners in the 16th century with notable academic accomplishments and familial devoutness.

The Roper family owns several estates around the United Kingdom, such as Candelwick, Trimdon Estates, Galway Estates, Pylewell Park, Bradford, Hyde and Charlton. They also acquired the Kent estates in the 15th century by Lord John Roper while Sir Henry Roper acquired the Galway estates in the 19th century. Other additional estates include; Chestfeild, Modingham, Brambiltighe, Cheselherst, and Saint Dunstans. 

Henry Francis Roper, who was the 14th Baron of Teynham, inherited John Barnewall Curzon’s and estate at Water Perry, Northamptonshire and all his wealth in the year 1788 after his death. John was his cousin; Francis was able to add his name to his Royal license hence joining the House of Curzon and House of Roper, and in his honor, he became the Henry Francis Roper-Curzon. In the modern days, some of his descendants use his names e.g. Harry Roper-Curzon, David Roper-Curzon and John Roper-Curzon.

There are many places named after them, such as Roper Street, based in Greenwich's in London. More specifically, it's in the Eltham constituency. Other streets include on in the Heanor’s Amber Valley, and the United Kingdom called Roper Avenue. Also Roper road is in England's South East territory known as Canterbury. Roper Park in Chelsea is named after them.

Their family motto also acted as a court of arms, and it states, "Light to the English, across to the French" (Reaney and Marvin).

Piccola Roma

Piccola Roma was the nickname of Asmara (capital of Italian Eritrea), during the decades of Italian colonial rule of Eritrea.

The city of Asmara was founded by the Italians in the last years of the XIX century, from a small native village. Soon was made the capital of their colonial possessions in Eritrea, mainly because of the climate being located at more than 2000 meters of altitude.

In the 1930s the city was being populated by many thousands of Italian colonists and in 1940 it was mostly Italian looking (by architecture and by inhabitants way of life). That it the reason why it was called "Piccola Roma" ("little Rome"), due to the fact that it was a bit similar to the capital of Italy (Roma).

The capital of Eritrea experienced a huge increase in population: in 1935 there were only 4,000 Italians and 12,000 Eritreans; in 1938 there were 48,000 Italians and 36,000 Eritreans. Historian Gian Luca Podesta wrote that practically Asmara in 1940 has become an Italian city (he wrote: ""in pratica Asmara era diventata una citta' italiana"".

"Piccola Roma" was a typical Italian city created in the middle of eastern Africa, where the majority of the population was southern european in appearance & customs, spoke italian and practised the catholicism when WW2 started. It was going to be the industrial center of the "Italian East Africa", but the war blocked this development.

Historian Maitacli wrote that:

""The city is known for its early 20th century buildings, including the Art Deco "Cinema Impero" (opened in 1937 and considered by the experts one of the world's finest examples of Art Déco style building), the Cubist "Africa Pension", the rationalist "Governor's Palace", the eclectic Eritrean Orthodox "Tewahdo" Church, the former "Asmara Opera House", the futurist architecture "Fiat Tagliero Building", the neo-Romanesque architecture "Roman Catholic Cathedral", and the neoclassical architecture "President's Palace". The city is adorned by Italian colonial villas and mansions, one prominent example being the 'Asmara's World Bank Building'...""

Most of central Asmara was built between 1935 and 1941, so effectively the Italians managed to build almost an entire city in just six short years.

Actually (in July 2017) Asmara has been declared "World Heritage Site" by the UNESCO, mainly because of the architecture created during the Italian colonial years (that lasted from 1881 until 1941).

Lord Randolph Henry Spencer-Churchill (13 February 1849 – 24 January 1895) was Winston Churchill's father. He was a son of the 7th Duke of Marlborough. 

He was a leading British Tory politician. Churchill was a Tory radical who coined the term "One-nation conservatism". 

He inspired a generation of party managers and created the National Union of the Conservative Party. He broke new ground in modern budgetary presentations. He got admiration and criticism from across the political spectrum. His disloyalty to Lord Salisbury was the beginning of the end of what might have been a glittering career. His elder son, Winston, wrote a biography of him in 1906.

Churchill died early, suffering from a disease. That disease was either syphilis or a brain tumour or even multiple sclerosis. 

It is definitely the case that he was treated for syphilis, and it has been suggested that he was suffering from symptoms of the mercury-based medication. The Churchills' family doctor in the 1880s had written about syphilis. He referred Randolph to the specialist Thomas Buzzard, and continued to prescribe potassium iodide and mercury.

To rescue the girl, Komaram Bheem arrives in Delhi with his men. They capture a wild tiger in the forests to aid their mission. Nizam of Hyderabad warns Scott's office about the same.

Alluri Sita Rama Raju is a police officer who proves his ability to serve the Empire. When Lady Buxton offers a promotion to the officer who catches the leader of the Gond tribe alive, Ram comes forward. He attends a meeting of the independent activists and proposes to assassinate Scott. As their goals seem to align, Bheem's aid Lachhu asks Ram to meet Bheem. However, Lachhu flees when he senses that Ram is a police. Lachhu tells Bheem about this who asks him to hide.

Ram and Bheem accidentally meet and team up to save a boy. Bheem introduces himself as a Muslim named Akhtar while Ram hides his identity of an officer. They become best friends. Bheem comes across Scott's niece Jennifer when they are trying to sneak into the palace. Ram helps Bheem to get close to her. Jennifer invites Bheem to a party which the duo attend. Impressed by his dance, Jennifer invites Bheem to the palace. Bheem silently meets Malli, assuring her rescue. Ram captures Lachhu to ask whereabouts about their leader but in vain. Lachhu gets hold of a common krait and throws it onto Ram which bites him. Lacchu warns Ram that it can kill him within an hour without anti-venom, known only to Gond people. Ram finds his way to Bheem who saves him. Bheem confesses to Ram by telling him about their mission.

Bheem and his men barge into the palace with a truck full of wild animals. Bheem unleashes them onto the British soldiers. However, Ram obstructs him as a police officer. Bheem pleads not to arrest him but Ram does not budge. Furious, Bheem fights off Ram, and goes on to climb the palace walls. Ram stops him while General Scott holds Malli at point blank. Bheem surrenders with no option left.

Bheem is sentenced to death via a public execution. Scott offers mercy if he kneels but Bheem refuses despite heaving lashing by Ram. He sings a song which motivates the public to rebel. Bheem is taken away by the officers. Ram recalls that his father Venkat Ramaraju had rebelled and sacrificed his life against the British. Venkat takes a promise from Ram that he'd a deliver a weapon to every person who takes part in the rebellion.

Venkat's friend Venkateswarulu informs Ram that his promise is going to be fulfilled since he is appointed as in charge of a shipment of arms. Ram, however, puts saving Bheem and the girl as his priority. He requests Scott to execute Bheem in the outskirts as a part of his plan. However, Scott recognizes the ploy, and injures him. Bheem frees himself and fights the guards off. Ram shoots a Britisher over Malli's head to save her. Misunderstanding this as an attack, Bheem beats up Ram and escapes with Malli. Bheem and his men hide in Hathras but the British officers arrive there. Sita recognizes that they are in danger and drives away the officers by lying that the place is infected with small pox. Sita reveals that she is Ram's cousin and love interest. She adds that Ram is sentenced to death as he went against the British to save his best friend. Bheem regrets his actions and promises Sita to rescue Ram.

Bheem sneaks into the Barracks with the help of blue print given by Jennifer. He frees Ram from the prison, taking him on his shoulder as the latter is unable to walk. Together, they fight the guards and escape. Bheem treats Ram, however, the soldiers attack them in the woods. Ram takes bow and arrows from a shrine of Lord Rama and retaliates. Bheem joins him with a javelin. They fight off the soldiers and head towards the palace. They blast a motorcycle into a room full of TNT, and explode the building. Bheem retrieves guns and ammunition and delivers it to Ram. Lady Scott is killed in the chaos while Scott is killed by Ram and Bheem.

They reunite with Sita, Jennifer and others. Upon Ram's insistence, Bheem requests to return the favour by educating him. Ram returns to his village and delivers the weapons as promised while Bheem returns to his hamlet, reuniting Malli with her mother.

Dashavatar

The Dashavatara refers to the ten main incarnations of Lord Vishnu, the god of preservation. Vishnu is said to descend in the form of an avatar to restore balance in the world.

The list of included avatars varies across sects and regions. All avatars have appeared except Kalki, who will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga.

The order of the ancient concept of Dashavataras has been interpreted to be reflective of modern Darwinian evolution- it is the theory of evolution told as a story, written between 12.000-14,000 years ago. It describes the cycle of human evolution beginning in water as Matsya the fish, on to the amphibious phase (half land and water) as Koorma, the tortoise, on to begin firmly established on land as the wild boar Varaha, then Narsimha- half man- half animal, followed by Vamana, the Dwarf man, on to Parashurama, the emotionally volatile man, on to Rama, the peaceful man, Balram , then Krishna, a loving man , who is said to be succeeded by the final incarnation of Vishnu, or the last stage of evolution as Kalki, the mystical man. This is thus also a description of the evolution of consciousness.

The Word Dashavatar means Ten Incarnations or Ten Avatars



The word “Avatar”, a Sanskrit word means “descent”. In Sanatana Dharma it means the Descent/Incarnation/Manifest/Appearance of Lord/Supreme Being/Deity in an earthly embodiment.

There is no reference of Avatar exists in Vedas. The Bhagavad Gita discusses the subject matter associated with Avatar in textual format in Chapter 4 Slokas 5~9, where Lord Shri Krishna Himself declared the role of taking Avatar.

Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time I descend Myself. To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium. (Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4 Verses 7~8)

Various versions of the list of Vishnu's avatars exist, varying per region and tradition. Some lists mention Krishna as the eighth avatar and the Buddha as the ninth avatar, while others – such as the "Yatindramatadipika", a 17th-century summary of Srivaisnava doctrine – give Balarama as the eighth avatar and Krishna as the ninth. The latter version is followed by some Vaishnavas who don't accept the Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu. Though no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard, the "most accepted list found in Puranas and other texts is [...] Krishna, Buddha."

The following table summarises the position of avatars within the Dashavatara 

The Agni Purana, Padma Purana, Garuda Purana, Linga Purana, Narada Purana, Skanda Purana and Varaha Purana mention the common (Krishna, Buddha) Dashavatara list.The Garuda Purana has two lists, one longer list with Krishna and Buddha, and a list with Balarama and Buddha, which substitutes Vamana for Rama. The Shiva Purana has Balarama and Krishna. 

The list with Krishna and Buddha is also found in the Garuda Purana "Saroddhara", a commentary or ‘extracted essence’ of the Garuda Purana (i.e. not the Purana itself, with which it seems to be confused):The Fish, the Tortoise, the Boar, the Man-Lion, the Dwarf, Parasurama, Rama, Krisna, Buddha, and also Kalki: These ten names should always be meditated upon by the wise. Those who recite them near the diseased are called relatives.

---Garuda Purana Saroddhara by Navanidhirama (translated by E. Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam), Chapter VIII, Verses 10-11

Limba noastră

"Limba noastră" (, meaning "Our Language") is the national anthem of Moldova. Before it became the country's national anthem in 1995, another national anthem – the same one used by neighbouring Romania – was used. The lyrics of "Limba noastră" were written by Alexei Mateevici a month before his death in 1917, and the tune for his lyrics was composed a while later by Alexandru Cristea in 1942.

Only the first, second, fifth, ninth, and twelfth stanzas (each highlighted in bold) are officially part of the Moldovan national anthem.

Romanian alphabet

The Romanian alphabet is a variant of the Latin alphabet used by the Romanian language. It is a modification of the classical Latin alphabet and consists of 31 letters. Five of the letters (Ă, Â, Î, Ș, and Ț) have been changed from their Latin originals for the phonetic requirements of the language:

The letters Q ("chiu"), W ("dublu v"), and Y ("igrec" or "i grec") were formally introduced in the Romanian alphabet in 1982, although they had been used earlier. They occur only in foreign words and their Romanian derivatives, such as "quasar", "watt", and "yacht". The letter "K", although relatively older, is also rarely used and appears only in proper names and international neologisms such as "kilogram", "broker", "karate". These four letters are still perceived as foreign, which explains their usage for stylistic purposes in words such as "nomenklatură" (normally "nomenclatură", meaning "nomenclature", but sometimes spelled with "k" instead of "c" if referring to members of the Communist leadership in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc countries, as "Nomenklatura" is used in English).

In cases where the word is a direct borrowing having diacritical marks not present in the above alphabet, official spelling tends to favor their use ("München", "Angoulême" etc., as opposed to the use of "Istanbul" over "İstanbul").

S-comma

S-comma (majuscule: Ș, minuscule: ș) is a letter which is part of the Romanian alphabet, used to represent the sound , the voiceless postalveolar fricative (like "sh" in "shoe").

The letter was proposed in the "Buda Lexicon", a book published in 1825, which included two texts by Petru Maior, "Orthographia romana sive latino-valachica una cum clavi" and "Dialogu pentru inceputul linbei române", introducing ș for and ț for .

S-comma was not initially supported in early Unicode versions, nor in the predecessors like ISO/IEC 8859-2 and Windows-1250. Instead, Ş (S-cedilla), a character available since Unicode 1.1.0 (1993), was used for digital texts written in Romanian. In some contexts, like with low-resolution screens and printouts, the visual distinction between "ș" and "ş" is minimal. In 1999, at the request of the , S-comma was introduced in Unicode 3.0. Nevertheless, encoding for the S-comma was not supported in retail versions of Microsoft Windows XP, but a later European Union Expansion Font Update provided the feature. While digital accessibility to S-comma has since improved, both characters continue to be used interchangeably in various contexts like publishing.

The letter is part of Unicode's Latin Extended-B range, under "Additions for Romanian", titled as "Latin capital letter S with comma below" (U+0218) and "Latin small letter s with comma below" (U+0219). In HTML, these can be encoded by codice_1 and codice_2, respectively.

Laws of thermodynamics

There are four laws of thermodynamics. They talk about temperature, heat, work, and entropy. They are used in thermodynamics and other sciences, for example chemistry.

Thermodynamics has three main laws: the first law, the second law, and the third law. Then there was another law, called the "zeroth law." The law of conservation of mass is also an important idea in thermodynamics, but it is not called law.

Laws of Thermodynamics is an integral part of Chemistry, which not only explain the surrounding but also the infinite Universe which governs by the laws of chemistry and others.

The "zeroth law of thermodynamics" says temperature is an empirical parameter in thermodynamic systems. It states the transitive relationship between the temperatures of multiple bodies in thermal equilibrium. The law says: If two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

The "first law of thermodynamics" is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic systems. The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed. It can also be stated in the following form:The energy gained (or lost) by a system is equal to the energy lost (or gained) by its surroundings.

The "second law of thermodynamics" says that some things can't be undone after they are done. This indicates that entropy is real. It states that, in an isolated system, entropy can increase but cannot decrease. It can be stated as follows:Natural processes tend to go only one way, toward less usable energy and more disorder. 

The third law of thermodynamics "can be stated as:"A system's entropy approaches a constant value as its temperature approaches absolute zero.

Modular exponentiation

Modular exponentiation is about finding the value of the equation c = b mod m. This is the remainder when dividing b by m. It is the inverse function of the discrete logarithm. Because modular exponentiation is easy and fast, and finding the discrete logarithm is difficult, both are used in fields such as public-key cryptography.

When dealing with very large whole numbers, directly finding the result can be very resource intensive. We can make some optimisations to save computation power with principles like exponention by squaring.

Let's solve c = b mod m:

The English split the Dutch colony of New Netherland into two pieces, and named them New York and New Jersey. More immigration occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Australian Shepherd

The Australian Shepherd, sometimes referred to as the Aussie Shepherd, is a medium-sized breed of dog developed in the United States, despite its name.

It is very similar in its appearance to the English Shepherd and Border Collie, and indeed, studies have shown they are very similar in relation. Like many herding dogs, they show considerable drive and energy, being best at jobs such as search and rescue dogs, disaster dogs, therapy dogs, guide dogs, etc. For these reasons, they have become the 17th most popular dog breed in the United States.

The Australian Shepherd is usually a medium-sized breed. They can weigh from and stand from in height. The Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA) standard says the Australian shepherd must stand between at the shoulders, females being and males measuring ; however, quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size.

The known Aussie colors are solid black, solid red (liver), blue merle, and red/liver merle; and these colors may also have copper (tan) points or white markings in various combinations on the face, chest, and legs. A black or red dog with copper and white trim is called 'tricolor' or 'tri', while a black or red dog with white trim but no copper is called 'bicolor' or 'bi'. White, rather than skin color, on or around the ears is an indicator of increased risk for deafness. Too much white on the face and ears can place an individual dog at greater risk for sunburn and subsequent skin cancer.

The wide variety of colors comes from the color allele, which is either black (B) dominant or red (b), and the dominant merle allele (M). Together, these provide four coat-color aspects that can appear in any combination:

The merle allele, which produces a mingled or patchwork combination of dark and light areas, is the coat pattern most commonly associated with the breed. This merle (M) is dominant, so heterozygous dogs (Mm) show the pigmentation pattern; however, when two merles are bred, the statistical risk is that 25% of the offspring will end up with the two copies of the merle gene (homozygous). These dogs usually have a mostly white coat and blue irises and are often deaf, blind, or both. In this case, deafness and blindness are linked to having two copies of the Merle gene, which disrupts pigmentation and produces these health defects. The tri-colored (red, black, and white) Merles will have a 1/4 chance of being blind because of the genes when breeding two Merle colored dogs for the recessive fur color.

All black and blue merle dogs have black noses, eye rims, and lips. All red and red merle dogs have liver or brown noses, eye rims, and lips.

Also, variety is seen in the Aussie's eye color, and they are often heterochromatic. An early nickname for the breed was "ghost-eye dog". Aussie eyes may be any shade of brown or blue; they may have two different colored eyes, or even have bicolored or "split eyes" (for example, a half-brown, half-blue eye), which appear to be similar to the merle coloration. Merled eyes exist where one color is mixed in and swirled with another. Any combination of eye colors is fine in the breed standard, so long as the eyes are healthy. In general, however, black Aussies (self, bi-color, or tri-color) tend to have brown eyes. In contrast, red (self, bi-color, or tri-color) Aussies usually have amber eyes, though these Aussies may also carry the blue-eyed gene.

The merle type in Australian Shepherds is similar to Mitf mouse mutants' coat color.

Although some Aussies are born with naturally bobbed or partially bobbed (stubby) tails, the majority are born with full, long tails. Breeders have historically docked the tails when the puppies are born. In the United States and Canada, the standard calls for a natural bob or docked tail not to exceed four inches as a defining characteristic. Any natural tail length is permitted when showing in Europe, where cutting off a part of their tail has been banned in most countries, including the United Kingdom.

It is known only from the type species, Hatzegopteryx thambema, named in 2002 based on parts of the skull and humerus. Additional fossils, including a neck vertebra, were included later. The largest of these remains shows that the Hatzegopteryx was one of the biggest pterosaurs, with an estimated wingspan of .

It is unusual because it had a very wide skull with large muscular attachments. The bones had a soft internal texture instead of being hollow. it had a short, robust, and heavily muscled neck long. This short neck was about half the length of other azhdarchids. The neck could withstand strong bending forces. "Hatzegopteryx" lived on Hațeg Island, an island in the Cretaceous subtropics within the prehistoric Tethys Sea. It was probably the apex predator of Hațeg Island, tackling larger prey (including dwarf titanosaurs and iguanodontians) than other azhdarchids.

Day With(out) Art grew in collaborations to estimated 8,000 national and international museums, galleries, art centers, AIDS service organizations, libraries, high schools and colleges take part.

New York group called "Visual AIDS" (now NGO), initiated public actions and programs, published an annual poster and copyright-free broadsides, and acted as press coordinator and clearing house for projects for Day Without Art/World AIDS Day. Day With(out) Art highlights art projects by artists living with HIV/AIDS, and art about AIDS, that were taking place around the world.

Zaza people

The Zazas (also known as Zazaki or Dimili) are an Iranian people in eastern Turkey who traditionally speak the Zaza language, a western Iranian language written in the Latin script. Their homeland is made of Tunceli and Bingöl provinces and parts of Elazığ, Erzincan and Diyarbakır provinces. Zazas might say that they are Kurds. They are often named Zaza Kurds by scholars.

The reason Zazas are comsidered Kurdish is speculated to be "control". In an area hard to control, Zazas were grouped with Kurdish people to assimilate and break them from their roots. 
In an effort to preserve their culture and declare they are a seperate nationality, Zazas founded ZAZA-DER. In the page about their sociological and historical roots, it is extensively explained with sources that Zazas are a seperate nationality with different language, culture and etimology. 

Predominantly Zazas adhere to Sunni Islam. According to a 2015 study that examined the voting-age adults of the Eastern and Southern Anatolia 75.4% of the people who stated that they were ethnically Zazas belonged to the Shafiʽi school of Islam, similar to Kurdish groups, but in contrast to local Turkish and Arab people who were majority Hanafi. Shafi‘i followers among the Zaza people are mostly Naqshbandi.

Alevism is the second largest Islamic sect among Zazas with 14.8% adhering to it. Zazas had the highest Alevi percentage among any group by far, being followed by Turks (5.4%) and Kurds (3.1%). It was also reported that around 70% of the Alevis spoke Zazaki as their mother language. Zaza Alevis mainly live around Tunceli Province. Hanafism, which is the biggest Islamic school in both Turkey and among the Turkish and Arabic people in the region, is followed by 9.8% of Zazas.

Historically, a small Shia Zaza population existed in Gerger.

The national library of Poland was created in 18th century. Initially, it was called the Załuski Library. First resources of library were the collections of John III Sobieski. Later, this collection was confiscated by Russian troops and placed in Imperial Public Library. 

When Poland regained her independence in 1918, there was no central institution to serve in the capacity of a national library. Recreation of National Library of Poland was made on 24 February 1928, by the decree of president Ignacy Mościcki. It was opened in 1930 and initially had 200 thousand volumes.

History of the Jews in Canada

The history of the Jews in Canada is the history of Canadian citizens who follow Judaism as their religion and/or are ethnically Jewish. Jewish Canadians are a part of the greater Jewish diaspora and form the fourth largest Jewish community in the world, exceeded only by those in Israel, the United States, and France. As of 2011, Statistics Canada listed 329,500 followers of the Jewish religion in Canada and 309,650 who claimed Jewish as an ethnicity. One does not necessarily include the other and studies which have attempted to combine the two numbers have arrived at figures above 375,000 Jews in Canada. This total would be approximately 1.1% of the Canadian population.

The Jewish community in Canada is composed mainly of Ashkenazi Jews and their descendants. Several other major Jewish ethnic divisions are also represented. These include Sephardi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, and Bene Israel from India, besides converts to Judaism. The Canadian community has all four of the main modern denominations of Judaism. Many religious and cultural customs are observed.

Though they are a small minority of the total Canadian population, Jews have been present in the country since the first Jewish immigrants arrived with Governor Edward Cornwallis to establish Halifax, Nova Scotia (1749).

Elu (Portuguese pronoun)

The "elu" system () is based on a set of linguistic proposals created with the purpose of preparing the Portuguese language with a neuter grammatical gender. The most prominent proposal is the personal neopronouns "elu", "delu", "nelu", and "daquelu", intended to be a proposal for how to refer to non-binary people (whose gender identity is not male or female) or whose gender is unknown, or irrelevant, as well as groups with different genders, without resorting to the "generic masculine". These proposals can be used by and for anyone, regardless of gender.

The pronoun "elu" tries to present the least number of problems in its use when trying to function smoothly in oral speech, listening, writing and visual identification, creating similarity between "ela" ("she"), "ele" ("he"), and "elu" (functionally similar to singular they).

Nouns in Portuguese all have grammatical gender, and this gender impacts some grammatical inflections. Grammatical gender is different from personal gender identity―rather, words referring to a generic individual with unknown gender identity still carries grammatical gender. For example, the word "pessoa" ("person") is grammatically feminine, but indicates no specific gender of the person referred to. The gender inflection appears explicitly when in the context of an inflectied adjective. With the feminine nouns such as "cidade" ("city"; plural "cidades"), the adjective meaning "beautiful" (currently written generically as "belo" in dictionaries) would become "cidade bela", "cidades belas" ("beautiful city/cities"). Likewise, this works with a masculine noun such as "carro" ("car"; plural "carros"): "carro belo", "carros belos" ("beautiful car/cars").

The Portuguese language as a rule determines that the plural of nouns, when covering individuals of the feminine and masculine gender, is made based on the generic masculine: a collective of "vinte alunas" ("twenty female students") and "dez alunos" ("ten male students"), is said as "trinta alunos" ("thirty students"). This form of plural formation is considered sexist by certain groups and individuals, resulting in proposals for a neutral gender to be adopted, such as "thirty children" ("trinta menines").

A similar known neopronoun in Portuguese is "ile", also called "sistema ile" ("ile system"), was popularized in 2020. The systems happen to be same when applying neolanguage beyond pronouns, they use ⟨-e⟩ suffixes.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an adventure game created by Nintendo EPD and Monolith Soft. It was published by Nintendo for Nintendo Switch and Wii U. It was released on March 3, 2017. On April 25, 2019, Nintendo added a new feature that makes the game playable in virtual reality, using Nintendo Labo. 

According to legend, when Ganon returns, the chosen hero, Link, and the royal princess, Zelda, are destined to defeat him. Ten thousand years ago, a group of people called the Sheikah created technologies for defeating Ganon, called Guardians and Divine Beasts. Once Ganon had been destroyed, the king prohibited this technology, because he thought that Sheikah technology could be used in the future to attack the kingdom. Because of this, the Sheikah split into the Yiga, murderers who followed Ganon and the Sheikah who were still loyal, who went into hiding. 

About a hundred years from the present, Ganon returns. The new king tried to use the Sheikah technology again to defeat Ganon. However, Ganon already controlled Sheikah technology and he used this to attack the kingdom. As a consequence, Link and princess Zelda were defeated by Sheikah technology. Link had to recover for a hundred years and when he woke up in the Shrine of Resurrection, and the game starts. He now has to return in search of Zelda to help her destroy Ganon with the help of clues Zelda left along the way. 

Development began in 2013. It took a long time because of all the details they added to it. They used new ideas from developers which made it more original and refreshing. It was a pioneering game and it broke the conventions of the saga, you can walk anywhere in the world even climb mountains, sail rafts, swim, run, walk, explore, fight, or even teleport later on in the game.

An interesting feature of the game is that it is interactive and the characters can respond to you differently depending on what you are wearing. For example, if you are wearing something metallic, like a metal sword, metal shield or metal bow, in a storm, lightning can strike you and kill you, so make sure to unequip your weapons or use wood weapons instead.

It has been extremely successful around the world since it was first published. It has sold around 20 million copies worldwide.

Hydrogel

Hydrogels are three-dimensional polymeric networks filled with water. The water content can reach as high as 90-99% depending on the polymer concentration. It contains polymers that are attracted to water, they swell and hold large amounts of water while maintaining their structure due to chemical or physical cross-linking of individual polymer chains. The physical cross-linked hydrogels are easily pulled and relaxed, like a rubber band. The chemically cross-linked hydrogels avoid deformation. The behaviour of hydrogels is typically viscoelastic which is associated with the water and the movement of polymer networks in fluids. Similar to other polymers, there are natural and man-made hydrogels. The man-made hydrogels are also known as synthetic, this allows the hydrogels to have a longer service life, hold more water, and have greater strength. 

There are many types of hydrogels. The most common ones are pH-sensitive hydrogels, which respond to pH changes in the environment. Temperature-sensitive hydrogels, which are affected by how hot or cold the environment is. Electro-sensitive hydrogels, which either shrink or expand when an electric field is applied. Lastly, the light-responsive hydrogels respond to light. 

In many ways hydrogels are similar to our bodies because the human body is made out of mainly water and matrix materials that are surrounded by cells. This is why hydrogels can be used in tissue engineering. Hydrogels are filled with water so they mimic tissue environments, this means they are optimal to deliver cells and repair damaged tissue.

Electrowinning

Electrowinning is a manufacturing process for making metals from a solution containing dissolved metal. The process involves passing an electrical current from an inert electrode through the solution containing the metal, to plate the metal to another electrode. Also called electroplating, it is a common process for producing metals like copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, aluminum, and gold among others. Electrowinning is one of the last processes in metal production. It commonly follows leaching which is a process that dissolves minerals into a solution. 

The electrical current is passed from the inert electrode, called the anode, and passes through the metal containing solution, called the electrolyte, and the metal is plated on another electrode, called the cathode. The ability to plate a metal depends on the reduction potential. The reduction potential depends on the many factors such as the metal in question, the solution temperature, the pH of the solution and other factors. The rate at which the metal can be produced depends on the amount of current being passed through the solution.

Industrially the process is made up of a square cathode with equal sized anodes on each side so that the metal can be plated evenly on both sides of the cathode. A cell consists of alternating anodes and cathodes, starting and ending with anodes. A production plant consists of many cells allowing for production of lots of metal.

Purna Swaraj

Purna Swaraj, or "total independence," was a document written by the Indian National Congress session at Lahore ,Punjab The Former Capital of the Undivided Punjab in December 19, 1929. It said that India should be separate from the British Empire. Purna Swaraj was announced on January 26, 1930. This is one reason why January 26 is India's Republic Day.

The Purna Swaraj was 750 words long. Scholars such as Mithi Mukherjee say it was an important part of Indian independence because it said becoming independent was about justice.

Whitewater controversy

The Whitewater controversy, Whitewater scandal, or simply Whitewater, was an American political controversy during the 1990s. It began with an investigation into the real estate investments of Bill and Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater Development Corporation. Neither Bill Clinton nor Hillary Clinton were ever prosecuted, after three separate inquiries found lack of evidence linking them with the criminal conduct. 

A March 1992 "New York Times" article published during the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign reported that the Clintons, then governor and first lady of Arkansas, had invested and lost money in the Whitewater Development Corporation.

Lewis looked for connections between the savings and loan company and the Clintons, and on September 2, 1992, she submitted a criminal referral to the FBI naming Bill and Hillary Clinton as witnesses in the Madison Guaranty case. 

David Hale, the source of criminal allegations against the Clintons, claimed in November 1993 that Bill Clinton had pressured him into providing an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal. 

Jim Guy Tucker, Bill Clinton's replacement as governor, was convicted of fraud and sentenced to four years of probation for his role in the controversy.

Hypogamy

Hypogamy is marrying someone considered to be of lower economic or social class or caste. Hypogamy has been found to be practiced more by men than by women. For men power and control is the one of the strongest attainments and what often leads them to pursue a hypogamous relationship. The idea of power and control is made possible by the gender roles and expectations that society has instilled in both men and women. Societal institutions have created deeply rooted systematic differences between men and women and an idea of how far women can go socially, professionally, and economically. Immigration and citizenship have influenced the goal of marriage, consequentially creating hypogamy on the personal level. 

Moldovan Americans

Moldovan Americans are Americans who are from Moldova or are descended from Moldovans. According to the U.S. 2000 census, there were 7,859 Moldovan Americans in the United States. However, the American Community Survey indicated that the number of Moldovan immigrants greatly increased over the years, and in 2014 exceeded 40,000 people in the United States. Most Moldovan Americans are Eastern Orthodox. 

Mediterranean tree frog

The Mediterranean tree frog or stripeless tree frog ("Hyla meridionalis") is a frog from Africa and Europe. It lives in parts of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Portugal, Spain, France and Italy where there is plenty of water in the air.

The adult male frog is 55 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 65 mm long. It has disks on its toes for climbing. Its belly is white or almost white. Its back is green, yellow or green-yellow. It can change color. It has two dark stripes, one on each side of its head. The stripe starts at the nose and goes over the eye and ear to the shoulder.

The beginning and the duration of the reproductive period are very different. In southern France it extends from April to June, in Portugal from December to January (and later), in North Africa from March to April, in Tenerife from December to May. Sometimes she experiences an interruption due to bad weather. This is not uncommon for the Mediterranean tree frogs of the Camargue, France, when the mistral brings cold air from the Massif Central to the coast and causes a sudden fall in the weather there. Female frogs lay eggs on groups of plants near the edge of a body of water. The tadpoles hatch after eight to ten days. The very largest tadpoles grow to 5.5 cm long. They become frogs after three or four months. The frogs eat insects and insect-like animals, for example spiders.

Types of crushing machines

Crushers are machines used to reduce the size of rocks, stones and ore. They are often utilized in aggregates production, construction material recycling and in mining operations. 

There are four traditional types of crushers in materials engineering. They are known as jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, cone crushers and roll crushers. The first two crushers mentioned are the most common when it comes to mineral processing. Roll crushers are a relatively new type of crusher and they are just starting to become more and more popular in mineral processing. 

The main idea behind how jaw crushers work is that there is a hinge plate that moves back and forth with a fixed plate is held up against the prior hinge plate. The beginning of the process has the jaws of the crusher open to receive a rock. The hinge plate, like a big jaw-bone, bites down on the rock and crushes it.

Gyratory crushers have a conical outer wall and a large spindle suspended from a bearing. There is a circular propeller at the bottom of the crusher that oscillates, spins around, really fast and compresses the rocks that enter.

For roll crushers, there are two side by side rolls, one fixed and the other can move a little bit from side to side. The gap between the rollers is what determines the output size of the rocks. Forcing rocks through these gaps produces a large amount of shear stress on them and causes them to break apart.

Cone Crushers are compression-type crushers that are typically found in secondary crushing stages but can be used as the primary crusher in certain applications. They handle medium hard to very hard, abrasive materials that can be dry or wet but not sticky. Cone Crushers are typically found in quarried materials and sand and gravel applications.

Bisection method

The bisection method is a way to estimate solutions for single equations. When we solve one equation, this method can help us to get a number that is very close to the real solution. 

Think about a continuous function F(x). If the curve of F(x) passes through the x-axis, it means that there must be one specific x number which makes F(x) = 0, in other words, a solution. But how to judge whether the curve passes the x-axis or not? We pick one section with lower boundary a1 and upper boundary b1. Then we calculate F(a) and F(b). If F(b) has different signal with F(a) (or F(a)*F(b) < 0), the F(x) curve will pass through the x-axis in this section, which means F(x) must have a solution in this section. In this way, we can estimate a range of the solution. 

To make our estimation more precise, we need to shorten the range which contains the solution. We divide this section into two equal parts: ( a , a/2+b/2) and (a/2+b/2, b). Then we apply the same method to judge whether there is a solution in each section. If there is no solutions in one section( F(a)*F(a/2+b/2) > 0 or F(a/2+b/2)*F(b)> 0), we ignore this section. If there is a solution in one section (F(a)*F(a/2+b/2) < 0 or F(a/2+b/2)*F(b) < 0), we continue to shorten the range until the range is smaller than the error of estimation we expected. Finally, we take the middle point of the final range as a solution of F(x).

Valorant

Valorant (stylized as VALORANT) is a free-to-play multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows. First talked about under the codename "Project A" in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by official release on June 2, 2020.

Nernst equation

Nernst Equation is a scientific equation used to find the reduction potential or voltage of an electrochemical cell. It is widely used in cell physiology and neurobiology. It is named after . He was a German chemist who created this equation. 

This equation can be used to check which combination of chemicals will be suitable to construct a powerful electric cell.

Nernst Equation:

formula_1

where 

E = Reduction potential or voltage of the electrochemical cell. In SI units, the voltage counts the one kilogram blocks you have to push one meter for each 6.2x10 electrons you move across the cell. In a perfect world, every time a 9 volt battery moves 6.2x10 electrons, we could harness the slow-moving electrons to move 9 blocks one meter.

E = Standard potential of the cell. It is the reduction potential of the cell or voltage under standard conditions (Temperature = 298 Kelvin, Pressure = 1 bar).

R = Gas constant. It is an important constant used in thermodynamics. Its value is 8.314 J.K.mol.

T = Temperature of the electrochemical cell in Kelvin.

z = Number of moles of electrons that got transferred when reduction took place.

F  = Faraday constant. It is equal to the charge carried by 1 mole of electrons. Faraday constant = 96,485.3329 s Ampere/mole.

Q = Reaction quotient of the chemical reaction that is driving the cell.

When the reduction potential of a cell = 0 V, it is in equilibrium. At equilibrium, the reaction quotient Q = K (equilibrium constant).

Thermodynamics in nutrition

The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transformed from one form to another. This law also applies to nutrition. 

Many experts disagree with the belief of counting calories as a method to lose bodyfat. 1 pound of bodyfat roughly equals 3500 calories. Therefore, eating 500 calories less everyday for 7 days straight would result in exactly 1 pound of loss in bodyfat. Several studies have proven this to be false solidifying the belief that counting calories does not work. This disparity can be explained.

1. Thermic effect of food: 1 calorie of protein is not the same as 1 calorie of carbohydrates or fats. The body requires energy to digest food. Fats require only 0-3% of the total energy from food to get digested. Carbohydrates require 5-10% of energy while proteins require 20-30% of energy. Therefore, the macronutrient profile (protein, carbohydrates and fats ratio) play an important role in weight loss.

2. NEAT: Non exercise activity thermogenesis or NEAT is the amount of energy a person uses during daily activities. Examples of NEAT include jittering, walking, brushing teeth and even writing. People generally feel weaker when they consume less calories so they tend to move less reducing NEAT.

3. Miscounting calories: Studies have shown that over 90% of the population underestimate their daily caloric consumption. 

Ultimately, calories consumed versus calories spent will always hold true. In order to lose weight, one must consume less calories and move more.

Angle grinder

An angle grinder is a handheld power tool. It is also known as a disc grinder or side grinder. They are commonly used in machine shops and metal workshops. Most angle grinders today are powered by electricity. They can be corded or battery-powered. Angle grinders can be used for cutting, grinding, and polishing objects.

There are different kinds of discs that are used for various materials and tasks. Angle grinders can use grinding stones, sanding discs, wire brush wheels, cut-off discs, abrasive grinding discs, and polishing pads. Angle grinders come in different disc sizes and motor specifications. Other differences include a power source, rpm, and arbor size. Generally disc size and power increase together. Disc size is measured in imperial or metric units. Pneumatic grinders are generally used for lighter duty jobs where more precision is required. Electric grinders are more commonly used for larger, heavy-duty jobs.

Angle grinders generate sparks when cutting ferrous metals. The blades on the angle grinder may also break during operation. Proper personal protective equipment must always be worn when using an angle grinder. Angle grinders should never be used without their guard or handle attached. Inspect the discs for cracks, defects, and wear before using an angle grinder.

Demis Hassabis

Demosthenes "Demis" Hassabis (born 27 July 1976) is a significant figure in artificial intelligence. He is a British researcher, neuroscientist, video game designer, entrepreneur, and five times winner of the Pentamind board games championship. 

Hassabis is the CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, a machine learning AI startup, founded in London in 2010 with Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman. Hassabis met Legg when both were postdocs at University College London's Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, and he and Suleyman had been friends through family. Hassabis also recruited his university friend and Elixir partner David Silver.
DeepMind's mission is to "solve intelligence" and then use intelligence "to solve everything else". More concretely, DeepMind aims to use powerful general-purpose learning algorithms to build an artificial general intelligence (AGI).

The company was bought by Google for £400 million. 

They created AlphaGo, a program which defeated world champion Lee Sedol at the complex game of Go. Go had been considered a holy grail of AI, for its high number of possible board positions and resistance to existing programming techniques. However, AlphaGo beat European champion Fan Hui 5-0 in October 2015 before winning 4-1 against former world champion Lee Sedol in March 2016. 

More recently, DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to protein-folding, one of the toughest problems in science. In December 2018, DeepMind's tool AlphaFold won the 13th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins.

Although Hassabis is expert at many games, he does not program specific rules into Deep Mind. For Go and chess, the machine played many games with itself, learning from its results. In other words it taught itself how to play, given the basic rules of the game.

Delian League

The Delian League was founded in 478 BC. It was an association of Greek city-states under the leadership of Athens. The League had a many cities: at various times between 150 and 330. 

The League was led by Athens to continue fighting the Persian Empire. The Greeks had won the Battle of Plataea at the end of the Second Persian invasion of Greece. 

The League's modern name comes from its official meeting place, the island of Delos, where congresses were held in the temple. The treasury stood there, until Pericles moved it to Athens in 454 BC.

Soon after the League was set up, Athens began to use the League's funds for its own purposes. This led to conflict between Athens and the less powerful members of the League. By 431 BC, the League presented a threat to Sparta. This, and Athens's heavy-handed control of the League, started the Peloponnesian War. The League was dissolved after the war's end in 404 BC by the order of Lysander, the Spartan commander.

My Grandfather's Clock

"My Grandfather's Clock" is a song written by Henry Clay Work in 1876. He also wrote "Marching Through Georgia". British brass bands and colliery bands play "My Grandfather's Clock". Bluegrass musicians also play it.

The "Oxford English Dictionary" says the name "grandfather clock" comes from this song. Before that, grandfather clocks were called "longcase clocks". In 1905, Harry Macdonough and the Haydn Quartet (known then as the "Edison Quartet") made the first recording of this song that people know about.

Henry Clay Work saw a clock in a Piercebridge hotel and thought of the song.

The song is told from a grandchild's point of view. The song is about their grandfather's clock.

The clock is purchased on the morning of the grandfather's birth and works perfectly for 90 years, requiring only that it be wound at the end of each week.

The clock seems to know good and bad things that happen in the grandfather's life: It rings 24 chimes when the grandfather brings his new wife into his house. Near the grandfather's death, it rings an alarm, so the family gathers by his bed. After the grandfather dies, the clock stops and it never works again.

Work wrote a sequel to the song two years later. The grandchild is the narrator again. The grandson says he is sad that the clock no longer works. The clock is sold to a junk dealer, who sells its parts and sells its case for people to burn. In the grandfather's house, the clock is replaced by a wall clock. The grandchild does not like the wall clock and calls it "that vain, stuck-up thing on the wall". The sequel was never as popular as the original.

The song was performed and translated many times. In the Czech version, sung by the country band Taxmeni, the song continues with an additional, joyful part, narrating further events in the grandson's life: the birth of his son and the purchase of a new clock on the same day, to maintain the family tradition.

"My Grandfather's Clock" was often played in Britain on "Children's Favourites". It was recorded by the Radio Revellers. In the United States, a version, without the last stanza of lyrics was recorded on an extended-play 45 rpm vinyl record on the Peter Pan label. (The other song on that side was "The Syncopated Clock", and the other side had "The Arkansas Traveler" and "Red River Valley".) Johnny Cash covered the song on his 1959 album "Songs of Our Soil". Evelyn Knight recorded the song for Decca Records. In 1959, it was included on the Four Lads' album, "Swing Along". Other versions became popular in other countries, for example, in Japan, singer Ken Hirai performed a cover, which became massively popular in 2002.

In March 1961, on his album "Swing Low", Sam Cooke sang the song.

Bing Crosby sang the song in a medley on his album "101 Gang Songs" (1961).

The song was the inspiration for the 1963 "Twilight Zone" episode "Ninety Years Without Slumbering".

The Big 3 recorded the song in their album "Live at the Recording Studio" in 1964

A popular clock toy, marketed by Fisher-Price from 1962 to 1968, had a dial on it that, when turned, caused the music box mechanism in the toy to play the song along with clock-like ticking and moving hands on the face of the clock. A new version of the toy (which is completely made of plastic and has other activities like a clicking plastic mouse on the side) has been manufactured by Fisher-Price since 1994. Other companies have also made imitations of the toy worldwide.

Jon Pertwee recorded a version in 1966 for the children's album "Children's Favourites", on the Music for Pleasure record label.

John Fahey recorded a solo guitar version on his 1967 album "Days Have Gone By".

Joan Morris recorded it in 1975, on "Who Shall Rule This American Nation (Nonesuch)", an album of songs by Work.

In 1983, Fred Penner, a Canadian children's entertainer, covered "My Grandfather's Clock" on the LP album "Special Delivery", which was later rereleased as "Ebenezer Sneezer" on CD in 1994.

Red Grammer recorded the song on his 1994 family music recording, "Down The Do Re Mi".

The Kenneth Williams character Rambling Syd Rumpo wrote a joke version of this song, "My Grandfather's Grunge", on the BBC radio show "Round the Horne". It was written by Barry Took and Marty Feldman.

Garrison Keillor and the cast of the radio show "A Prairie Home Companion" recorded a parody titled "My Grandmother's Cat", telling the story of an old woman who overfed her cat until it was big enough to knock her down and try to eat her.

"My Grandfather's Clock" is a playable song in the 2008 video game "Wii Music".

This song was also used in the video game, "Five Nights at Freddy's 2", made by Scott Cawthon. It was released on November 10, 2014. The chorus of the song plays whenever a music box is wound up to keep one of the game's animatronic enemies away.

It was also sung by Maple and Cinnamon in the third volume of "Nekopara" visual novel series.

The City Green in Union Park of Middletown, Connecticut includes this bust of the author near his birthplace.

My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf,

So it stood ninety years on the floor;

It was taller by half than the old man himself,

Though it weighed not a pennyweight more.

It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born,

And was always his treasure and pride;

But it stopp'd short — never to go again —

When the old man died.

In watching its pendulum swing to and fro,

Many hours had he spent while a boy.

And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know

And to share both his grief and his joy.

For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door,

With a blooming and beautiful bride;

But it stopped short — never to go again —

When the old man died.

My grandfather said that of those he could hire,

Not a servant so faithful he found;

For it wasted no time, and had but one desire —

At the close of each week to be wound.

And it kept in its place — not a frown upon its face,

And its hands never hung by its side.

But it stopped short — never to go again —

When the old man died.

It rang an alarm in the dead of the night —

An alarm that for years had been dumb;

And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight —

That his hour of departure had come.

Still the clock kept the time, with a soft and muffled chime,

As we silently stood by his side;

But it stopped short — never to go again —

When the old man died.

Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy

The 38th Super Bowl was shown on television as it was happening on February 1, 2004 on CBS. The halftime show of the Super Bowl got controversy when Janet Jackson's breast was revealed by Justin Timberlake to everyone watching the show. This caused a big debate on broadcasting things that people might see as offensive.

MTV was the producer of the halftime show. 143.6 million people watched the halftime show when it first happened. The incident with Jackson and Timberlake made CBS and MTV remove Jackson's songs from its radio and television channels. The Federal Communications Commission gave CBS a fine of US$27,500 for the incident. The fine was made bigger for US$325,000 and then even bigger, for US$550,000. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals removed the fine in 2011. The FCC tried to put another fine on CBS in 2012, but it was rejected.

The incident made Janet Jackson the most searched words ever on the Internet. It also became the most watched event on TiVo and made 35,000 people become new subscribers to TiVo. The term "wardrobe malfunction" (meaning an error related to clothing) was made because of the incident. It was later added to "Webster's Dictionary".

Blue Whale Challenge

The Blue Whale Challenge, also called Blue Whale game, or simply Blue whale is an internet phenomenon that started in 2016, in Russia. Over a period of 50 days, participants are assigned tasks. Each participant gets one task a day. At first, the tasks are harmless (such as: get up at 4.30am, and watch a horror movie). Later, the tasks require the participants to hurt themselves. The final task requires the player to commit suicide.

When people want to quit, they are threatened. Sometimes, this includes threats to the family of the participant.

The first to report on this was the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, in 2016. It linked many suicides of children. All these children had been members of the group "F57", in the Russian social network called VK. The article claimed there were 130 suicides because of the challenge. The article was later criticized, because it made connections where none existed. None of the suicides were found to be related to the activities of the group. There were several suicides which have been linked to the challenge. So far, no link has been proven.

Two girls in Irkutslk, aged 14 and 15 years committed suicide together, after solving 50 tasks. They jumped off a building. Another 14 year old threw herself in front of a train.

The Way It Is (Keyshia Cole album)

The Way It Is is the debut studio album by American R&B singer Keyshia Cole; it was released on June 21, 2005, by A&M Records. The album debuted at number 6 on the US "Billboard" 200 and it was supported by five singles, including "Never", "I Changed My Mind", "(I Just Want It) To Be Over", "I Should Have Cheated" and "Love". The album sold 89,000 units in its first week.

The album was certified gold within 17 weeks, and then platinum, only eight weeks later. The album stayed on the charts for over a year, eventually selling over 1.6 million copies and it is Cole's second highest-selling album to date.

Upon its release, "The Way It is" garnered generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a rated mean out of 100 from mainstream critics, the album received a score of 77. Andy Kellman of Allmusic rated the album four out of five stars. He felt that "from the opener, the album seems to be set up like a linear narrative about a crumbling relationship, but it doesn't quite play out that way, with the scenes shuffled out of order. None of it's all that profound, but Cole sells it all extremely well. [Her] voice is sweet and ringing, like a wiser version of Lil' Mo who has had to weather a tremendous amount of drama. She could be around for a while." Janet Tzou, writing for "Entertainment Weekly" found that "Cole certainly nails all the basics on "The Way It Is": big-name guest talent and husky ballads lamenting those tricky matters of the heart. But Cole's native Oakland, California upbringing gives her vocals depth and her songs a genuine, lived-in feel."

Defection

Defection is when a person leaves their home country in a way the home country claims to be illegal. To the first country, they can be seen as traitors.
It is a political label used by authoritarian countries.

More broadly, it involves abandoning a person, cause, or doctrine to which one is bound by some tie. The tie may be one of allegiance or of duty.

An example of this today are North Koreans who escape the country to live in a new country, such as South Korea or the United States. The North Korean government makes leaving the country without permission illegal, and punishments for this are extremely harsh. Escapees who are caught usually get sent to a prison camp or are publicly put to death. There have been around 33,000 defectors from North Korea since the North Korean famine.

Spark plug

A spark plug also known as a "sparking plug", is a device used in delivering the electric current to the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber in an internal combustion engine. It’s connected to the ignition coil and as the electricity flows through the coil, a voltage difference develops between the electrodes on the spark plug. This causes electricity to jump the gap, making a spark which ignites fuel.

Flash (camera)

A camera flash, sometimes called a strobe or just a flash, is a device used in photography to allow pictures to be taken of dark areas by producing a flash of very bright light.
Flashes are often built into cameras, but external flashes are available and are mostly used by professional photographers, they can be mounted directly to the camera, or used 'off-camera' on a special stand or tripod.

Flashes were first used in the late 1800's in the form of a stick with magnesium on the top that when burned would produce very bright light (the stick was held in the air, and the camera shutter released at the same time), later camera flashes used a special type of light bulb known as a flashbulb, and modern flashes use LED's or a special type of tube which emits a flash of mostly blue light when electricity is applied to it from the flash capacitor (known as a xenon flashtube).
The use of a flash to take photographs is mostly known as 'flash photography' 

The use of flashes is not allowed in some places where it may be annoying to other people or where the bright light could damage rare or very old objects (like paintings) such as in a museum.

Scrat: Spaced Out

Scrat: Spaced Out is a 2019 American computer animated comedy slapstick short film directed by Mike Thurmeier and Galen T. Chu. The short is a spin-off of the Ice Age franchise and focuses on Scrat. This is the third Scrat short film and it's set right after the events of Collision Course. 
Right after the events of Collision Course, Scrat is ready to come back to Earth but he's kidnapped by alien female anthropomorphic sabertooth squirrels named Scratazons. 

The Scratazons tries to kill him but they ultimately fails, however they steals his acorn but luckily Scrat gets it back with the attraction ray. 

There's a battle between Scrat and the Scratazons leader with the attraction rays which ends with the explosion of the Scratazons ship and causes a black hole which swallows all of them except Scrat and the Scratazons leader.

Scrat initially loses the run against Scratazon for the acorn but he successfully uses the toilet to arrive to the acorn and he knock Scratazon away causing her to be swallowed by the black hole as well.

Scrat and his acorn are then swallowed as well but they are spitten out. Scrat is happy that he finally has his acorn but the black hole reopens and swallows the acorn, much to Scrat's horror and dismay. 

Scrat then screams in frustration while he floats in the space.


It's currently unknown if there will be another Scrat short but since the character is very popular it's most likely there will be at least another one. If there will be a new short film it will probably not be a direct continuation of this short as the shorts follows the "no-continuity" rule of the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner episodes.

Ankylosing spondylitis

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis. There is a long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine. 

Usually the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected. Eye and bowel problems may also occur. Pain in the back is a typical symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes. Stiffness of the affected joints usually gets worse over time.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) inflames the sacroiliac joints located between the base of the spine and pelvis from there the disease starts and gradually captures the entire spinal cord and there is complete tilt in the body. Some of the bones in the spine fuse, this fusing makes the spine less flexible. If ribs are affected, it can be difficult to breathe deeply.


If the pain in the back bone is more than 3 months and the stiffness is more on getting up in the morning, then we should see the rheumatologist as soon as possible. 

In this disease, the bones of the spine are completely fused, ie, the bones joining in this disease become one bone in 8-10 years, due to which the patient can get up, sit, walk, bend, twist of the neck. shuts down and all day-to-day activities are affected.

Giant planet

A giant planet is any planet much larger than Earth. They are usually mostly composed of low-boiling-point materials (gases or ices), rather than rock or other solid matter. Massive solid planets also exist. There are four giant planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Many extrasolar giant planets have been identified orbiting other stars.

Giant planets are also sometimes called jovian planets, the adjective for the name Jupiter. They are sometimes known as gas giants. Many astronomers use the latter term only for Jupiter and Saturn. They classify Uranus and Neptune, which have different compositions, as ice giants. Both names are potentially misleading: all of the giant planets consist primarily of fluids above their critical points, where distinct gas and liquid phases do not exist. The principal components are hydrogen and helium in the case of Jupiter and Saturn, and water, ammonia and methane in the case of Uranus and Neptune.

The defining differences between a very low-mass brown dwarf and a gas giant are not clear. One school of thought is based on formation; the other, on the physics of the interior. Part of the debate is whether "brown dwarfs" must, by definition, have had nuclear fusion at some point in their history.

The term "gas giant" was coined in 1952 by the science fiction writer James Blish. It was originally used to refer to all giant planets. Arguably it is something of a misnomer, because for most of thire volume the pressure is so high that matter is not in gaseous form. Other than the upper layers of the atmosphere, all matter is likely beyond the critical point, where there is no distinction between liquids and gases. "Fluid planet" would be a more accurate term. Jupiter also has metallic hydrogen near its center, but much of its volume is hydrogen, helium, and traces of other gases above their critical points. The observable atmospheres of all these planets (at less than unit optical depth) are quite thin compared to their radii, only extending perhaps one percent of the way to the center. Thus the observable portions are gaseous (in contrast to Mars and Earth, which have gaseous atmospheres through which the crust can be seen).

The rather misleading term has caught on because planetary scientists typically use "rock", "gas", and "ice" as shorthands for classes of elements and compounds found on planets, whatever the actual phase of matter. In the outer Solar System, hydrogen and helium are referred to as "gases"; water, methane, and ammonia as "ices"; and silicates and metals as "rock". When deep planetary interiors are considered, it may not be far off to say that, by "ice" astronomers mean oxygen and carbon, by "rock" they mean silicon, and by "gas" they mean hydrogen and helium. The many ways in which Uranus and Neptune differ from Jupiter and Saturn have led some to use the term only for the planets similar to the latter two. With this terminology in mind, some astronomers have started referring to Uranus and Neptune as ice giants to indicate the predominance of the "ices" (in fluid form) in their interior composition.

The alternative term "jovian planet" refers to the Roman god Jupiter, and meant all these planets were similar to Jupiter.

Objects large enough to start deuterium fusion (above 13 Jupiter masses for solar composition) are called brown dwarfs, and these occupy the mass range between that of large giant planets and the lowest-mass stars. The 13-Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule of thumb, not something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the Jupiter mass value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only on the mass but also on the composition of the planet, especially on the amount of helium and deuterium present. The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 60 Jupiter masses, and the Exoplanet Data Explorer up to 24 Jupiter masses.

A giant planet is a massive planet and has a thick atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. They may have a dense molten core of rocky elements, or the core may have completely dissolved and dispersed throughout the planet if the planet is hot enough. In "traditional" giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants) hydrogen and helium constitute most of the mass of the planet, whereas they only make up an outer envelope on Uranus and Neptune, which are instead mostly composed of water, ammonia, and methane and therefore increasingly referred to as "ice giants".

Extrasolar giant planets that orbit very close to their stars are the exoplanets that are easiest to detect. These are called hot Jupiters and hot Neptunes because they have very high surface temperatures. Hot Jupiters were, until the advent of space-borne telescopes, the most common form of exoplanet known, due to the relative ease of detecting them with ground-based instruments.

Giant planets are commonly said to lack solid surfaces, but it is more accurate to say that they lack surfaces altogether since the gases that constitute them simply become thinner and thinner with increasing distance from the planets' centers, eventually becoming indistinguishable from the interplanetary medium. Therefore, landing on a giant planet may or may not be possible, depending on the size and composition of its core.

Gas giants consist mostly of hydrogen and helium. The Solar System's gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, have heavier elements making up between 3 and 13 percent of their mass. Gas giants are thought to consist of an outer layer of molecular hydrogen, surrounding a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen, with a probable molten core with a rocky composition.

Jupiter and Saturn's outermost portion of the hydrogen atmosphere has many layers of visible clouds that are mostly composed of water and ammonia. The layer of metallic hydrogen makes up the bulk of each planet, and is referred to as "metallic" because the very high pressure turns hydrogen into an electrical conductor. The core is thought to consist of heavier elements at such high temperatures (20,000 K) and pressures that their properties are poorly understood.

Ice giants have distinctly different interior compositions from gas giants. The Solar System's ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere that extends from the cloud tops down to about 80% (Uranus) or 85% (Neptune) of their radius. Below this, they are predominantly "icy", i.e. consist mostly of water, methane, and ammonia. There is also some rock and gas, but various proportions of ice–rock–gas could mimic pure ice, so that the exact proportions are unknown.

Uranus and Neptune have very hazy atmospheric layers with small amounts of methane, giving them aquamarine colors; light blue and ultramarine respectively. Both have magnetic fields that are sharply inclined to their axes of rotation.

Unlike the other giant planets, Uranus has an extreme tilt that causes its seasons to be severely pronounced. The two planets also have other subtle but important differences. Uranus has more hydrogen and helium than Neptune despite being less massive overall. Neptune is therefore denser and has much more internal heat and a more active atmosphere. The Nice model, in fact, suggests that Neptune formed closer to the Sun than Uranus did, and should therefore have more heavy elements.

Massive solid planets can also exist. 

Solid planets up to thousands of Earth masses may be able to form around massive stars (B-type and O-type stars; 5–120 solar masses), where the protoplanetary disk would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high UV radiation and winds that could photoevaporate the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements.<ref name="mass/radius sold"></ref>
For comparison, Neptune's mass equals 17 Earth masses, Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, and the 13 Jupiter-mass limit used in the IAU's working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 Earth masses.

A super-puff is a type of exoplanet with a mass only a few times larger than
Earth’s but a radius larger than Neptune, giving it a very low mean density. They are cooler and less massive than the inflated low-density hot-Jupiters.

The most extreme examples known are the three planets around Kepler-51 which are all Jupiter-sized but with densities below 0.1 g/cm.

Because of the limited techniques available to detect exoplanets, many of those found to date have been of a size associated, in the Solar System, with giant planets. Because these large planets are inferred to share more in common with Jupiter than with the other giant planets, some have claimed that "jovian planet" is a more accurate term for them. Many of the exoplanets are much closer to their parent stars and hence much hotter than the giant planets in the Solar System, making it possible that some of those planets are a type not observed in the Solar System. Considering the relative abundances of the elements in the universe (about 98% hydrogen and helium) it would be surprising to find a predominantly rocky planet more massive than Jupiter. On the other hand, models of planetary-system formation have suggested that giant planets would be inhibited from forming as close to their stars as many of the extrasolar giant planets have been observed to orbit.

The bands seen in the atmosphere of Jupiter are due to counter-circulating streams of material called zones and belts, encircling the planet parallel to its equator. The zones are the lighter bands, and are at higher altitudes in the atmosphere. They have an internal updraft and are high-pressure regions. The belts are the darker bands, are lower in the atmosphere, and have an internal downdraft. They are low-pressure regions. These structures are somewhat analogous to the high and low-pressure cells in Earth's atmosphere, but they have a very different structure—latitudinal bands that circle the entire planet, as opposed to small confined cells of pressure. This appears to be a result of the rapid rotation and underlying symmetry of the planet. There are no oceans or landmasses to cause local heating and the rotation speed is much higher than that of Earth.

There are smaller structures as well: spots of different sizes and colors. On Jupiter, the most noticeable of these features is the Great Red Spot, which has been present for at least 300 years. These structures are huge storms. Some such spots are thunderheads as well.

QAnon

QAnon () is a disproven far-right conspiracy theory believing that a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles is running a global child sex-trafficking ring and are planning against former US president Donald Trump, who is fighting the cabal. 
QAnon also believes that Trump is planning a day known as the "Storm", when thousands of members of the cabal will be arrested. No part of the conspiracy claim is based in fact. 

QAnon's supporters have accused many liberal Hollywood actors, Democratic politicians, and high-ranking government officials of being members of the cabal.

Former followers of the group have criticized it for vandalism of stores and general antisocial behavior.

Members of the movement actively took part in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, during which they supported Donald Trump's campaign. After Joe Biden won, they were involved in efforts to overturn the results of the election. Many of the QAnon followers attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, which caused many media websites to track down and block QAnon information and members from spreading.

Pizzagate conspiracy theory

"Pizzagate" is a debunked conspiracy theory that went viral during the 2016 United States presidential election cycle mainly supported by far-right politicians and activists.

In March 2016, the personal email account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, was hacked in a spear-phishing attack. Supporters of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory falsely claimed the emails had coded messages that connected several high-ranking Democratic Party officials and U.S. restaurants with an alleged human trafficking and child sex ring.

Murder of Seth Rich

The murder of Seth Rich happened on Sunday, July 10, 2016, at 4:20 a.m. in Washington, D.C. Rich died about an hour and a half after receiving two gunshot wounds to the back. He was murdered by unknown people for unknown reasons, but police suspected he had been the victim of an attempted robbery.

The 27-year-old Rich worked for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and his murder caused many right-wing conspiracy theories, including the false claim that Rich had been involved with the leaked DNC emails in 2016. 

"The New York Times", "Los Angeles Times", and "The Washington Post" wrote that the promotion of these conspiracy theories was an example of fake news.

Hot Jupiter

Hot Jupiters are a class of gas giant exoplanets that are physically similar to Jupiter but have very short orbital periods (). They are close to their stars, with high surface-atmosphere temperatures. Hot Jupiters are usually tidally locked.

Hot Jupiters are the easiest extrasolar planets to detect by the radial-velocity method. The oscillations of their parent stars' motion are large and rapid compared to those of other types of planets. These oscillations are caused by the planet orbiting its star in the line of sight of the Earth.

Since it seems that they are common, that raises the question of why the Solar System has its largest planet so far from its star. This led astronomers to think the Earth's Jupiter was first much closer to the Sun, and moved out later to its present orbit.
One of the best-known hot Jupiters is . Discovered in 1995, it was the first extrasolar planet found orbiting a Sun-like star. has an orbital period of about 4 days.

2016 Democratic National Committee email leak

The 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak is a collection of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails stolen by one or more hackers working under the pseudonym "Guccifer 2.0" who are said to be Russian intelligence agency hackers, according to indictments carried out by the Mueller investigation.

These emails were leaked by DCLeaks in June and July 2016 and by WikiLeaks on July 22, 2016, just before the 2016 Democratic National Convention. 

This collection included 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC. The leak includes emails from seven key DNC staff members, and date from January 2015 to May 2016. 

The leaks also showed the DNC trying to sabotage and spread fake information to hurt then-2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and his presidential campaign.

On November 6, 2016, WikiLeaks released a second batch of DNC emails, adding 8,263 emails to its collection.

Bartolomé Esteban Murillo

Bartolomé Esteban Murillo (Seville, baptized on January 1, 1618– April 3, 1682) was a Spanish Baroque painter. A central personality of the Sevillian school, with many followers who carried his influence well into the 18th century. He was also the best known and most appreciated Spanish painter outside of Spain. Most of his paintings are religious, for Sevillian churches and convents. Unlike other great Spanish masters of his time, he also cultivated genre painting on a continuous and independent basis. throughout much of his career.

Hyla felixarabica

The Arabian tree frog ("Hyla felixarabica") is a frog from the Middle East. Scientists saw it in Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.

Scientists say there are two separate groups of Arabian tree frogs: one in the hills in Yemen and Asir Mountains in Saudia Arabia and another group in Syria, Israel and the hills in Jordan.

Scientists used to think that this was the same frog as the Middle East tree frog, but it is not. Scientists believe that the Arabian tree frog separated from the Middle East tree frog 8.4 million years ago. They believe the two groups of frogs were separated by the Dead Sea Rift and then became different species over time.

SpaceX Starship

Starship is a rocket made by the American company SpaceX. The rocket is made out of stainless steel. The rocket is made of two stages: Super Heavy and Starship. Both of these stages can be used again. This is unusual for a rocket. The rocket is expected to lift of people and things to orbit. It is expected to travel to the Moon. It is expected to serve space tourists, and also help humans going to Mars.

In 2023, Starship became the tallest and the most powerful rocket ever flown.

In September 2019, Starship Mk1 (Mark 1) was the first built Starship. The next vehicle, named Mk2, was built in Florida five months later. Mk1 failed [testing at cold temperature, or] the cryogenic proof test. It did not fly.

Mk2 was recycled. It did not fly.

Mk3's name changed to SN1 (serial number 1). On 28 February 2020, SN1 crushed itself during a cryogenic proof test. It is because of a leak in the bottom tank. On 8 March 2020, SN2's tank completed its only cryogenic proof test. On 3 April 2020, during the SN3 cryogenic proof test, a valve leaked liquid nitrogen inside its bottom tank. This causes the vehicle to lose pressure and crush itself. On 29 May 2020, SN4 had its fifth successful static fire test. But, after the test, the connected propellant pipe made SN4 explode.

On 4 August 2020, SN5 completed a flight with one Raptor. The rocket went to before coming down. It is the first Starship spacecraft to complete a flight intact. On 24 August 2020, SN6 repeated SN5's flight and did not explode.

SN8 was the first complete Starship. In October and November 2020, SN8 survived four static fire tests. The first, second, and fourth tests were successful, but the third test failed. In the third test, SN8's Raptors destroyed the mount. The concrete layer melted, splashed, and hit a Raptor.

On 9 December 2020, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) warned SN8 could explode if it was flown as planned. SpaceX ignored its warnings. SN8 then flew up, making it the first Starship to fly. It goes as high as , then comes back down. While landing, SN8's methane header tank did not pump enough methane to the Raptors. This causes one engine to burn itself. So, SN8 hit the ground fast and exploded.

On 2 February 2021, SN9 flew high. During the landing, a Raptor does not work. So, SN9 lands at an angle and exploded as well. On 3 March 2021, SN10 repeated SN9's flight. It then landed with all Raptors working. But, because SN10 was damaged, it blew up eight minutes later. On 8 March 2021, the first Super Heavy booster named BN1 (booster number 1) was finished.

On 30 March 2021, SN11 exploded in dense fog. No one knows why it exploded. A possible explanation is that a Raptor burned SN11's computer. This could let too much propellant flow into the engine's turbopump. When the engine is lit, the pressure inside the chamber is too much, making SN11 explode.

SpaceX did not finish SN12, SN13, SN14. Their improvements were added to SN15 instead. On 5 May 2021, SN15 flew the same flight and landed. It did not explode after launch. On 20 July 2021, BN3 static fired for the only time. 

Around July 2021, SpaceX started using the word "Ship" instead of "SN" for Starship spacecrafts. "Booster" instead of "BN" is another name for the Super Heavy boosters.

Super Heavy and Starship must pass many tests before launch. Firstly, they are filled with nitrogen gas to check for leaks. Then, cold liquid nitrogen fills and drains from Starship and Super Heavy to check the tanks' strength. Finally, propellant fills their tanks, and the Raptor engines are fired. 

Since 2005, SpaceX has been working on ideas similar to Starship. The company then checks the design with a series of tests: from flying high in July 2019, to flying high in May 2021.

SpaceX tried to do an Orbital test flight in April 2023.

In April 2023, a booster rocket and a spacecraft launched. 1 minute 25 seconds into the launch, the booster and the spacecraft could not be steered. The flight continued up to altitude of 39 kilometres (24 mi), then began to tumble. The flight did not reach orbit.

"Three of the 33 engines on the" booster rocket "were shut down before the rocket even left the launchpad", according to media's paraphrasing of Elon Musk; Furthermore, “The system didn’t think" that those 3 engines "were healthy enough to bring them to full thrust,” “so they were shut down”, according to Musk.

At about 27 seconds into the flight, SpaceX lost communications with another engine. 

The flight passed max q. 

1 minute 25 seconds into the launch, SpaceX lost thrust vector control and therefore the ability to steer the rocket.

The flight came up to altitude of 39 kilometres (24 mi), then began to tumble.

At 29 kilometres (18 mi), about four minutes after liftoff, the (onboard) Autonomous flight safety system destroyed the booster and the Starship. (One source says that "a self-destruct mechanism" was triggered.) The time from the triggering to disintegration (or destruction), was 40 seconds. That time is supposed to be much shorter.

SpaceX tried to do an Orbital test flight in November 2023; The spaceship and booster separated. The spaceship came to an altitude of 148 km (92 mi). The spaceship was supposed to fly for 90 minutes, but at 8 minutes 4 seconds of flight, the (onboard) Autonomous flight safety system (or "flight termination system") started the process of destroying the spaceship, and shortly after that the spaceship blew up. By that time SpaceX had lost communications with the spacecraft. The flight did not reach orbit.

The flight of the spaceship: At 40 minutes and 46 seconds (into the flight), "Raptor in-space relight demo" was supposed to happen. That relight of Raptor (engine) did not happen because the spaceship [seemed to roll too much, or] "due to vehicle roll rates". 

The spaceship came to an altitude of 145 miles. "SpaceX lost contact with" the spaceship when it was coming from Space, and into the Earth's atmosphere, or during re-entry, according to media.

The landing of the booster stage (or SuperHeavy) was not a success; It reached the surface (of the Gulf of Mexico), at too high speed.

One of the names of the flight, is "integrated flight test 3", or IFT-3. The test flight was on March 14, 2024. (Related page, Low Earth orbit)

Before launch, liquid oxygen and liquid methane fill the tanks of the booster rocket and the spaceship.

Engine chill begins on the booster, at 19 minutes 40 seconds before liftoff (as of 2023's first quarter). This is to protect the engine's turbopumps from thermal shock. 

The thirty-three engines startup-sequence begins, at eight seconds before liftoff. 

33 Raptor engines fire and lift the rocket up. Super Heavy and Starship will then separate. After that, the Starship spacecraft boosts itself into orbit. The booster then descends and lands on the launch tower's arms. When Starship lands, the spacecraft will glide using its flaps. At the last few seconds, the spacecraft flips up and lands.

Starship has two parts: the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft. Both Super Heavy and Starship should be able to land and launch many times quickly. That is the reason why the Starship rocket is often called a fully-reusable rocket. As of November 2021, no other rockets except Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy's booster can do this. Most of the rocket is made from SAE 304 stainless steel, the most common type. 

A Starship spacecraft lifts off (from Earth) on top of a booster. The spacecraft is supposed to carry of cargo to low Earth orbit. The Space Shuttle could only carry to the International Space Station, however. 

In this example, the International Space Station has an even lower orbit than Starship. The International Space Station orbits high at 51.64° inclination. Starship in this case orbits high at 98.9° inclination.
Below the spacecraft is a tall Super Heavy booster rocket. This booster can hold about of propellant. Super Heavy and Starship's propellants are liquid methane and liquid oxygen. The booster is made from stainless steel rings. These rings are thick, tall, and diameter.
At the bottom of the booster are 33 Raptor rocket engines. They can make of thrust, twice more than the Saturn V. The thrust speeds up the rocket to .

On top of the booster are four boxes containing fins in a grid pattern. These boxes are usually called grid fins, like those of the Falcon 9. Grid fins rotate to control and guide the booster while falling from the sky. When the booster comes back closer to Earth - just a few kilometers or miles above ground - the booster fires its engines and lands on the tower arms, which will 'catch' it.

SpaceX [had or] has two Super Heavy booster rockets, that have not been retired or scrapped (as of 2023's second quarter). They have not gone through the static fire test. However, in November 2023, a Super Heavy booster rocket was destroyed during a test flight.

The number of weeks that it takes to (put together or) assemble a Super Heavy booster: In 2021 it took 6 weeks to put together "Booster 3".

On top of the booster sits a tall Starship spacecraft. The spacecraft can hold about of propellant. Its propellant is the same as Super Heavy's, which are liquid methane and liquid oxygen. The Starship spacecraft is made from stainless steel rings, similar to Super Heavy.

At the bottom of the spacecraft are six rocket engines. Three of them are regular Raptor engines; three others are Raptor Vacuum engines. These regular Raptor engines work inside the air, while Raptor Vacuum engines work inside the vacuum.

There are two kinds of propellant tanks inside Starship: these are main tanks and header tanks. The main tanks store propellant for almost all functions of the spacecraft. However, when Starship lands, it uses its header tanks instead.

There are four flaps that connect to Starship's body. Two large flaps are at the bottom of the spacecraft, and two small flaps are at the top of the spacecraft. They are made from stainless steel sheets and bend to a trapezoid shape. The flaps can control Starship's falling speed and direction.

A black heat shield covers one side of the spacecraft. The heat shield is made from ceramic hexagon tiles and sheets of ceramic wool. They help to protect Starship from hot plasma, made when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere. Starship's heat shield could be durable and used many times.

Starship HLS (Starship Human Landing System) is supposed to land astronauts on the Moon during the Artemis program. It can take propellant from other Starships to have more range. The spacecraft would not have a heat shield or body flaps. However, it will have solar panels and landing engines. Starship HLS can be fueled and connected to the Orion spacecraft.

Both Super Heavy and Starship have SpaceX's Raptor rocket engines at the bottom. Each engine can make about of thrust. It has a full-flow staged combustion cycle design and burns liquid methane with liquid oxygen. 

Also at the bottom of the Starship spacecraft are the Raptor Vacuum engines. They are Raptor engines with larger nozzles. The Raptor Vacuum only works in space and is more efficient than the normal Raptor engine. The Raptor 2 engine is the next generation of the Raptor and Raptor Vacuum engines. They will be used in Super Heavy and Starship sometime in the future. 

This is how a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine works. First, liquid methane and oxygen flow into the engine's turbopumps. The turbopumps increase the liquids' pressure. Then, the methane and oxygen evaporate into hot gases in two preburners. One preburner gets more methane, and another gets more oxygen. The gas then turns the turbines and turbopumps by a shaft. These spinning turbines and turbopumps pump more propellant to the engine. This hot and mixed gas is then burned in a combustion chamber. Finally, the engine nozzle directs the ignited gas to make thrust.

Raptor engines will be made in a new factory at McGregor. Both the Raptor Vacuum and Raptor 2 are going to be made in another factory at Hawthorne.

On 16 April 2021, NASA (a government agency) selected Starship HLS as the Moon lander for the Artemis program. The other options were the Integrated Lander Vehicle by the National Team and Dynetics HLS by the Dynetics company. NASA then awarded SpaceX $2.89 billion to make Starship HLS. NASA wants Starship HLS to do a landing on the Moon without humans first. Then, Starship will send astronauts for the Artemis 3 mission.

The dearMoon project has no date for launch (as of 2022). In 2018, Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa announced that private space mission. Its crew are Maezawa himself and eight other people. The plan is to use Starship as the main spacecraft. The spacecraft is supposed to take them toward the Moon, circle around it, and then return back to Earth.

In January 2022, SpaceX got a $102 million five-year contract to develop the Rocket Cargo program for the United States Space Force.

Point-to-point flights (called "Earth to Earth" flights by SpaceX), is the idea of traveling anywhere on Earth in under an hour. John Logsdon, an academic on space policy and history, said point-to-point travel is unrealistic, as [the people on board and] the craft would switch between weightlessness to 5 "g" of acceleration.

SpaceX wants to start Mars colonization and terraforming. It would do so by sending humans to Mars. Musk's life goal is to ensure that humans are still around after a mass extinction on Earth. He also talked about Starships going to Enceladus, Europa, Pluto, and the Oort cloud. The Starship rocket on those missions could launch from Mars.

SpaceX thinks sending humans to Mars needs many steps. First, some Starships might carry many important things to Mars' surface. Inside them are fertilizer factories, propellant factories, and building materials. The propellant factory takes in carbon dioxide from Mars's air and hydrogen from the ice below. Then, the factory uses the Sabatier reaction. Hydrogen reacts with carbon dioxide with hydrogen to create methane and oxygen. Methane and oxygen are Starship's propellants. Filled up with the factory's methane and oxygen, Starship can return from Mars back to Earth. Building materials are used to make domes. They protect farmland from Mars's weather and atmosphere.

Musk has guessed that a city with a million people on Mars is enough to keep itself running. It should be able to create everything that the people need. The city does not need shipments from Earth by then. He guessed that the city needs at least ten thousand Starships full of humans. Each Starship can carry 100 passengers on board. To give the colony enough equipment and food, a hundred thousand Starships carrying cargo might launch to Mars. This guess does not have population growth.

Most Starships would carry satellites, cargo, and humans to Earth orbit. They would have a large door that rotates along a hinge. These Starships could catch space debris as well.

Some Starships would carry propellant instead of cargo. These spacecraft can fuel another spacecraft in orbit. Via fueling, these spacecraft would have more range and can go further.

Starships going to Mars also need fueling as well. That spacecraft might have forty rooms, a storage room, and a shelter. The shelter protects astronauts from the Sun's ionizing radiation.

SpaceX wants Starship to replace the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon 2. Musk guessed a Starship launch should cost $2 million (United States dollars) and the mission's propellant cost should be about $900,000. Starship could carry 400 Starlink satellites into orbit. A Falcon 9 can carry only 60 Starlink satellites.

In the past, the Starship spacecraft was planned to only bring cargo and astronauts to Mars. However, as of 2021, SpaceX is planning many kinds of Starships that do different tasks. They are different from each other by having parts added, removed, or changed.

The Starship spacecraft is supposed to carry cargo to higher Earth orbits, the Moon, and Mars.

Starbase is being used (as of 2023) for launches of prototypes. Rockets might also launch from boats, or LC-39A. Starbase at Texas is where SpaceX makes and tests most Super Heavy and Starship. The launch boats are named "Phobos" and "Deimos" after the moons of Mars. They were oil platforms owned by Valaris.

All Starship launch and landing places will have a tower. It has a large crane placed on top that can lift Super Heavy and Starship. That tower also has a pair of steel arms that rotate at a hinge similar to claws. The claws can catch Super Heavy as well.

Some people living near Starbase blamed SpaceX for harming wildlife, building and testing things without permission, and making too much noise. However, many people come to visit and stay there. When asked, they said that watching and imagining Starships sending humans to Mars made them love the place.

"Note: The start dates are when rocket stages were first seen, and the end dates are when they are destroyed or not used anymore.
A spaceship and its booster rocket were destroyed in flight, as late as March 2024.

In 2005, Elon Musk talked about a launch vehicle named BFR, later known as the Falcon XX. The Falcon XX was never built. Unlike Starship, it could only fly up once. Falcon XX was going to use Merlin 2 engine, a larger version of the Merlin engine. The engines burns kerosene and liquid oxygen.

In September 2016, at the 67th IAC (International Astronautical Congress), Elon Musk talked about the ITS (Interplanetary Transport System). It was going to be tall and wide. The booster was going to have 42 Raptors, and the spacecraft was going to have 9 Raptors. Both the booster and spacecraft are made from carbon composites, and could launch many times. The ITS can carry humans to Mars and other places inside the Solar System. When the spacecraft enters Mars's atmosphere, it cools by transpiration. Transpiration here means the spacecraft flows propellant to the front side and evaporates the heat.

At the next IAC in September 2017, Musk announced the Big Falcon Rocket. It is sometimes called Big Fucking Rocket. In that IAC, he talked about moving people around Earth quickly with a Big Falcon Rocket. He called it Earth to Earth.

In November 2018, Musk tweeted about a new spacecraft design. It had three bottom flaps and two top flaps. Around that time, the present names of Starship parts were first used:


In January 2019, Musk tweeted that Starship will be made from stainless steel instead of carbon composite. He explained that a stainless steel Starship is stronger than a carbon composite Starship. In March 2019, Musk tweeted again that Starships will have a heat shield made of tiles. The heat shield replaces transpiration cooling.

On 27 August 2019, "Starhopper", the first vehicle to use the Raptor, flew high. In October 2019, Starship's design had three Raptors and three Raptor Vacuum engines. There are only two bottom flaps in the new design. They are close to the heat shield’s edges.

Nambudiri

The Nambudiri, also transliterated Nambūdiri, Namboodiri, Namboothiri, and Nampūtiri, are a Malayali Brahmin caste, native to what is now the state of Kerala, India.

As the traditional feudal elite, Nambudiris owned a large portion of the land in the region of Malabar until the Kerala Land Reforms starting in 1957. Nambudiris have been noted for their unique practices such as the adherence to srauta ritualism and orthodox tradition. Cyriac Pullapilly mentions that the dominating influence of the Nambudiris was to be found in all matters: religion, politics, society, economics and culture of Kerala.

Nambudri Documentalist Advocate Jayaprakash Mallay. Awestruck by the nature and content of sahyadri khanda version of the skanda purana, I took courage to redefine Nambudri origins from the chaos of history's bizzare chess game with learned history scholars from National conferences like IHC and SIHC during 1999 - 2006 at various academic venues and enclaves. But their deafening silence prompted me to trigger this issue with Nambudri Brahmin scholars from Karikkad whose residence I shared in the early eighties. Emboldened by Nambudiries well versed in the Scriptures who narrated to me with pin point precision and stunning accuracy on an insider's expose about Nambudri Material Culture and Life Cycle Ritual, I came to the conclusion Nambudries have a shared heritage with Nalillacaran fishermen in Kerala. It is fortuitous fate that led me to take up residence at Puthan Mana, Pulikkathodi Illam and Moothedath Palasseri Mana all in the traditional Nambudri Village of Karikkad during 1983 - 1990 phase. As a participant observer I was appointed Registration Officer during Nambudri social gatherings called swajana sangamam consequently from 1997 - 2001 period. It all resulted in the production of my print media book Malayala Brahmin Autochthon Theory in the year 1995. The book was subjected to Tuesday Open Page Book Review in The Hindu.

Nambudiri mythology associates their immigration to Kerala from the banks of Narmada, Krishna, Kaveri rivers with the legendary creation of Kerala by Parasurama, the 6th avatar of Vishnu. According to this legend, the region was created when Parasurama threw his axe into the sea Although it is known that the present-day region of Kerala was once governed by the Chera dynasty, little information exists regarding its early ethnography. 
Brahmin presence in the Tamil country is attested from the Sangam period onward. Based on the fact that Nambudiris are Pūrvaśikhā Brahmins wearing the traditional hair tuft on the front, T.P Mahadevan proposes that they are the descendants of these Sangam age Brahmins who moved west into the region of Malabar during the Kalabhra interregnum. This sets them apart from the later Aparaśikhā Brahmin (wearing their hair tufts on the back) migrants to South India such as the Tamil Iyers. According to T.P Mahadevan, the Nambudiris brought with them a very early recension of the Mahabharata which became the basis of the Malayalam language version of the epic.

Anthropologists Heike Moser and Paul Younger note that the Nambudiri Brahmin presence predates the 9th century, as attested by grants of land given to them by ruling families. According to the historian Romila Thapar, local kings and chiefs encouraged them to move to the area by offering such tax-exempt land grants in return for them officiating in Vedic rites that would legitimise the grantors' status as rulers. They also gained land and improved their influence over the socio-economic life of the region by helping rulers during the wars between the Chola and Chera dynasties when Vedic schools were turned into military academies.

Operating from their "illam" houses, Nambudiris' ownership of agricultural land under the janmi system increased over many centuries and, according to Moser and Younger, they "established landholding temples and taught the people the rules of caste". The Nambudiris have been described to be responsible for the Sanskrit influence on Malayalam, basically a Dravidian language, due to the Nambudiri Brahmin's mixing of Sanskrit and the local Tamil language.

Medieval Kerala has been characterised as an oligarchy which was dominated by the Nambudiris, who owned all the temples and their subsidiary villages. The Nambudiris had influence with the ruling class through the practice of "sambandam", where younger Nambudiris used to have relationships with Kshatriya women or women from the upper sections of the Nair caste. The children of such unions were not considered Nambudiris, but a part of their matrilocal lineages. As a result of such unions, many kings and ruling chiefs in Kerala would be the offspring of Nambudiri fathers. These arrangements allowed the Nambudiris to gain political power in addition to religious and cultural dominance.

The Nambudiri's grip on land was maintained through the practice of strict primogeniture and patrilineal inheritance. Despite their younger members having hypergamous relationships with Nairs, whose caste traditions were matrilineal, Nambudiri families remained aloof from general society. Although the historian E. K. Pillai has claimed that the Nambudiris from the 1100s enforced matrilineal polyandry on the previously patrilineal communities of the area, sociologist Randall Collins thinks it is unlikely that such a change could be imposed and says that "more probably it was the result of a process of marriage politics spread by emulation in the decentralised situation of status competition." Some other scholars believe that the matrilineal customs predate the period entirely and cite the queens of the Pandyan dynasty as evidence for this.

The unwillingness of Nambudiris to adapt to changes in wider society persisted until the early years of the 20th century but Susan Bayly believes that their decline in significance can be traced to the period 1729-1748 when Marthanda Varma established the Kingdom of Travancore and chose to use Deshastha Brahmins from Tamil Nadu in his civil service. She believes that decision undermined the relationship between the Nambudiri Brahmins and royalty in the region, although others have said that Varma's influence was short-lived and that the main cause of change was the arrival of British colonial administrators, such as Colin Macaulay and John Munro, from the early 1800s. After the passing of the Charter Acts of 1833 and 1853 in the British Parliament, the British encouraged the work of Christian missionaries, notably in provision of education, and began the introduction of a judicial system that would have a significant impact on the landholdings, inheritance customs and marriage arrangements of both the Nambudiris and Nairs. The traditional basis of life was challenged by these and other changes, affecting also the other major ethnic groups of the area, such as the Ezhavas and the Syrian Christians.

Operating from their "illam" houses, Nambudiris' ownership of agricultural land under the janmi system increased over many centuries and, according to Moser and Younger, they "established landholding temples and taught the people the rules of caste". The Nambudiris have been described to be responsible for the Sanskrit influence on Malayalam, basically a Dravidian language, due to the Nambudiri Brahmin's mixing of Sanskrit and the local Tamil language.

Medieval Kerala has been characterised as an oligarchy which was dominated by the Nambudiris, who owned all the temples and their subsidiary villages. The Nambudiris had influence with the ruling class through the practice of "sambandam", where younger Nambudiris used to have relationships with Kshatriya women or women from the upper sections of the Nair caste. The children of such unions were not considered Nambudiris, but a part of their matrilocal lineages. As a result of such unions, many kings and ruling chiefs in Kerala would be the offspring of Nambudiri fathers. These arrangements allowed the Nambudiris to gain political power in addition to religious and cultural dominance.

The following Vedic recensions are attested among them.


The ancient Vedic ritual of Agnicayana (the altar of fire), which spans a 12-day period and which Frits Staal and Robert Gardner claim to be one of the oldest known rituals, was maintained by Nambudiri Brahmins until at least 1975. Although it may have largely died out elsewhere in India and thus be symptomatic of the community's resistance to change, David Knipe notes that it is still performed regularly in Andhra Pradesh and has been for centuries.

Traditionally, they wore a simple cloth around the waist called a thorthu (or thortumundu), in domestic settings. When they had to travel, they wore two sets of cloth in addition known as a vasthram.

Nambudiris wore their traditional hair tufts ("kuṭumi" or "śikhā") on the front like the Dikshitars of Tamil Nadu.

Nambudiri Brahmin families practised a more strict version of primogeniture than Brahmin communities elsewhere in India. Under this custom, only the eldest son could marry a Nambudiri woman and thus produce an heir to the family property. Younger sons were restricted to sambandam relationships with non-Brahmin women, whom the Nambudiris considered to be concubines and whose offspring could not inherit. This tradition limited the extent of marriage within their own caste and led to the practice of hypergamy with the Nair community. Kathleen Gough notes that:

The disparity in caste ranking in a relationship between a Brahmin man and a Nair woman meant that the woman was unable to live with her husband(s) in the Brahmin family and so remained in her own family. The children resulting from such marriages always became Nairs. K. M. Panikkar argues that it is this type of relationship that resulted in the matrilineal and matrilocal system. It has also been argued that the practice, along with judicious selection of the man who tied the "thali", formed a part of the Nair aspirational culture whereby they would seek to improve their status within the caste. Furthermore, that: 

Although it is certain that in theory hypergamy can cause a shortage of marriageable women in the lowest ranks of a caste and promote upwards social movement from the lower Nair subdivisions, the numbers involved would have been very small. It was not a common practice outside the higher subcaste groups and the Nambudiris had mostly stopped the practice by the 1920s.

The form of Sanskrit theatre known as Koodiyattam, which is native to Kerala, was traditionally patronised by Nambudiris.

Saint Thomas Christians

The Saint Thomas Christians are a very old community in Kerala, India. They are also called Syrian Christians of India, Nasrani or Malabar Nasrani or Malankara Nasrani or Nasrani Mappila. They are an ethno-religious community of Indian Christians who follow the East Syriac Rite, West Syriac Rite and the liturgical rites of Syriac Christianity. They trace their origins to the evangelistic or missionariy activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. Nasrani is an Arabic word for "Christian" that came from the Greek word Nazōraioi, Nazarene in English. The Saint Thomas Christians are now divided into different Churches like Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, Protestant, and independent bodies, each with their own liturgies and traditions. They are Malayali people and speak the Malayalam language

Saint Thomas Christians are a community with different ethnicities or different origins. Their culture is largely from East Syriac, West Syriac, Hindu, Jewish, and Latin Rite influences, blended with local customs and later elements derived from indigenous Indian and European colonial contacts. Their language is Malayalam, the language of Kerala, and Syriac is used for prayers.

The Saint Thomas Christians have also been nicknamed such due to their reverence for Saint Thomas the Apostle, who is said to have brought Christianity to India. The name dates back to the period of Portuguese colonisation. Nasrani means Christian; it appears to have been derived from the Hebrew word Netzer or the Aramaic Nasraya from Isaiah 11:1. Mappila is an honorific applied to members of non-Indian faiths and descendants of immigrants from the middle east who had intermarried with the local population, including Muslims (Jonaka Mappila) and Jews (Yuda Mappila). Some Syrian Christians of Travancore continue to attach this honorific title to their names. The Government of India designates members of the community as Syrian Christians, a term originating with the Dutch colonial authority that distinguishes the Saint Thomas Christians, who used Syriac (within East Syriac Rite or West Syriac Rite) as their liturgical language, from newly evangelised Christians who followed the Roman Rite.The terms Syrian or Syriac relate not to their ethnicity but to their historical, religious and liturgical connection to the Church of the East, or East Syriac Church.

History

According to tradition, Thomas the Apostle came to Muziris on the Kerala coast in AD 52 and converted many Nambudiri Brahmins to christianity and established the Ezharapallikal. The most prominent families are Pakalomattam, Sankarapuri, Kalli, Kalliyankal, Nedumpally, Kunnappilly, Payyippilly, Vazhappilly, Maliekkal, Panakkamattom and Thayil.

The Cochin Jews are known to have existed in Kerala in the 1st century AD, and it was possible for an Aramaic-speaking Jew, such as St. Thomas from Galilee, to make a trip to Kerala then. The earliest known source connecting the Apostle to India is the Acts of Thomas, likely written in the early 3rd century, perhaps in Edessa. A number of 3rd and 4th century Roman writers also mention Thomas' trip to India, including Ambrose of Milan, Gregory of Nazianzus, Jerome, and Ephrem the Syrian, while Eusebius of Caesarea records that St. Clement of Alexandria's teacher Pantaenus from Alexandria visited a Christian community in India using the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew language in the 2nd century.￼

The tradition of origin of the Christians in Kerala is found in a version of the Songs of Thomas or Thomma Parvam, written in 1601 and believed to be a summary of a larger and older work. Thomas is described as arriving in or around Maliankara and founding Seven Churches, or Ezharapallikal: Kodungallur, Kollam, Niranam, Nilackal (Chayal), Gokkamangalam, Kottakkavu , Palayoor and Thiruvithamcode Arappally (a "half church"). The Thomma Parvam also talks of the conversion of Jews, natives, and the local King at Kodungallur by St Thomas. The Thomma Parvam tells of St Thomas's mission in the rest of South India and his martyrdom at Mylapore in present-day Chennai, Tamil Nadu.￼

There is evidence that members of the St Thomas Christian community observed Brahmin customs in the Middle Ages, such as the wearing of the sacred thread and having a kudumi. The medieval historian Pius Malekandathil believes these were customs adopted and privileges won during the beginning of the Brahmin dominance of medieval Kerala. He argues that the Syrian Christians in Kerala, integrated with Persian Christian migrant merchants, in the 9th century to become a powerful trading community and were granted the privileges by the local rulers to promote revenue generation and to undermine Buddhist and Jain traders who rivaled the Brahmins for religious and political hegemony in Kerala at the time.

Tamil Brahmins

Tamil Brahmins are Tamil-speaking Brahmins, primarily living in Tamil Nadu, although a few of them have settled in other states like, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka. They can be broadly divided into three religious groups, Gurukkals who follow Saivism, Iyers who follow the Srauta and Smartha tradition and Iyengars who follow Sri Vaishnavism.
Tulu Nadu

Tulu Nadu, also called as Tulunaad, is a region on the southwestern coast of India. The Tulu people, known as 'Tuluva' (plural 'Tuluver'), speakers of Tulu, a Dravidian language, are the preponderant ethnic group of this region. South Canara, an erstwhile district and a historical area, encompassing the undivided territory of the contemporary Udupi, Dakshina Kannada, and Kasaragod districts, forms the cultural area of the Tuluver.

Historically, Tulu Nadu lay between the Gangavali River (Uttara Kannada district) in the north and the Chandragiri River (Kasaragod taluka) in the south. Currently, Tulu Nadu consists of the Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts of Karnataka, and the northern parts of the Kasaragod district of Kerala up to the Chandragiri River.

This region is not an official administrative entity. However, the Tulu Nadu state movement has been gaining momentum since the Indian States Reorganisation Act, 1956.

Mangalore, the second largest and a major city of Karnataka, is the chief and largest city of Tulu Nadu. Udupi, Kasaragod and Puttur are the other major cities of this region.

Knanaya

The Knānāya, (from Syriac: "Knā'nāya" (Canaanite)) also known as the Southists or Tekkumbhagar, are an endogamous ethnic group found among the Saint Thomas Christian community of Kerala, India. They are differentiated from another part of the community, known in this context as the Northists ("Vaddakkumbhagar"). There are about 300,000 Knanaya in India and elsewhere.

The origins of the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Northist and Southist groups is traced back to the arrival of the Syrian merchant Thomas of Cana (Knāi Thoma) who led a migration of Syriac Christians (Jewish-Christians) from Mesopotamia to India in the 4th or 8th century. The Knanaya claim descent from Thomas of Cana and those who came with him. The communities arrival was recorded on the "Thomas of Cana copper plates " which existed in Kerala until the 17th century after which point they were taken to Portugal by the Franciscan Order. The ethnic division between the Knanaya and other St. Thomas Christians was observed during the Portuguese colonization of India in the 16th century and was noted throughout the European colonial era.

Today, the majority of Knanaya are members of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church (Kottayam Archeparchy) and the Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church (Knanaya Archdiocese). They became increasingly prominent in Kerala in the late 19th century. Many Knanaya migrated away during the 20th and 21st centuries, largely westward, forming communities in non-Malayalam speaking areas, with a large expatriate community currently living in Houston, Texas and Chicago, Illinois in the United States.

The earliest extensive written evidence for the division of the Christian community of India dates to the 16th century. The St. Thomas Christian tradition defines the division as being both geographical and ethnic, expressing that the Native St. Thomas Christians initially resided on the north side of the Chera Empire's capitol city of Cranganore while the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya arrived and settled on the south side, which subsequently led to the designations Northist and Southist. Celebrated St. Thomas Christian scholar Dr. Placid J. Podipara wrote the following about the division:

"The Thomas Christians hail the Apostle St. Thomas as the founder of their Church...The first converts of St. Thomas were reinforced by local conversions and by Christian colonizations (migrations) from abroad. Connected with the IV century colonization is the origin of those called the "Southists""

Directional divisions within communities are common in Kerala, including among Hindu groups. A similar north–south division is found among the Nairs, and it historically appears to have been in place in the early Brahmin settlements in the area. The Saint Thomas Christians may have taken this trait from the Brahmins. 

The historical rationale for the division between the majority St. Thomas Christians and minority Knanaya traces the divide to the figure of Thomas of Cana, a Syrian merchant who led a group of 72 Jewish-Christian immigrant families, a bishop named Uraha Mar Yausef, and clergymen from Mesopotamia to settle in Cranganore, India in the 4th century (some sources place these events as late as the 9th century). This may reflect a historical migration of East Syrian Christians to India around this time, which established the region's relationship with the Church of the East.In the commonly accepted accounts of this history, the Knanaya are the descendants of Thomas of Cana and his followers, while the Northists descend from the local Christian body which had been converted by Thomas the Apostle centuries earlier. The "Oxford History of the Christian Church" states the following about the division: 
"In time, Jewish Christians of the most exclusive communities descended from settlers who accompanied Knayil Thomma (Kanayi) became known as ‘Southists’ (Tekkumbha ̄gar)...They distinguished between themselves and ‘Northists’ (Vatakkumbha ̄gar). The ‘Northists’, on the other hand, claimed direct descent from the very oldest Christians of the country, those who had been won to Christ by the Apostle Thomas himself. They had already long inhabited northern parts of Kodungallur. They had been there even before various waves of newcomers had arrived from the Babylonian or Mesopotamian provinces of Sassanian Persia."

Elements of Thomas of Cana's arrival feature in ancient songs as well as the Thomas of Cana copper plates awarded to his followers by a local Hindu ruler. These plates granted Thomas' followers 72 social, economic, and religious rights from Cheraman Perumal, the Chera king. The plates were present in Kerala during the time of the Portuguese colonization in the early 17th century, but were lost during Portuguese rule. Archbishop Francis Ros notes in his 1604 account "M.S. ADD 9853" that the plates were taken to Portugal by the Franciscan Order. The Knanaya invoke the plates as evidence of their descent from Thomas of Cana's mission. 

Translations of the existing Kollam Syrian Plates of the 9th century made by the Syrian Christian priest Ittimani in 1601 as well as the French Indologist Abraham Anquetil Duperron in 1758 both note that the forth plate mentioned a brief of the arrival of Knai Thoma.It is believed that this was a notation of the previous rights bestowed upon the Christians by Cheraman Perumal. The contemporary forth plate however does not mention this paragraph and is believed to be a later copy. Scholar of Early Christian history Istavan Percvel theorizes that at one time the Kollam Syrian plates and the Thomas of Cana plates were kept together.

Knanaya tradition claims that the Syriac Christian migrants who arrived with Thomas of Cana were Jewish-Christians. Community scholars express the historicity of this tradition by noting that Jewish-Christian tribes in Mesopotamia were a major component of the early Church of the East. Additionally, scholars express that both Jewish and Christian merchants of the region took part in the Arabian Sea trade with Kerala.

The community also cites their culture as evidence of their Jewish-Christian heritage, particularly their folk songs first written on palm-leave manuscripts in the 17th century. Many of the historical songs allude to the migrants being of Jewish descent such as the song "Nallor Orosilam" (The Good Jerusalem) which states the migrants prayed at the tomb of the Jewish Prophet Ezra before departing to India. A number of Jewish scholars such as Dr. P.M. Jussay, Dr. Nathan Katz, Dr. Shalva Weil, and Dr. Ophira Gamliel have noted that the Knanaya maintain cultural similarities to the Cochin Jews of India,suggesting historic cultural relations between the two communities. 

In 1939, the Knanaya politician and author Joseph Chazhikaden published a book on the community, "Tekkumbhagasamudayam Charitram", in which he included some aspects of the communities Jewish claim. Chazhikaden built upon the Thomas of Cana tradition but asserted that Thomas' followers originated in Judea. According to Chazhikaden, the group converted to Christianity while maintaining their distinct culture and identity. Eventually, they were forced out of their homeland and moved to Cranganore, where they were welcomed by the ruler Cheraman Perumal and lived near, but maintained their separateness from, the indigenous "Northist" Saint Thomas Christians. Many modern Knanaya accept the account as factual, while others reject it. As with other Knanaya origin traditions, some Northists dispute and condemn it.

In many other variants recorded during the colonial era, Thomas of Cana had two wives or partners, one of them being the ancestor of the endogamous Southists, and the other one being the ancestor of the Northist. A number of traditions and stories have emerged to explain the status of either wife, and both Southists and Northists historically used variants of these traditions to claim superiority for their group.
These variants are considered apocryphal and are not the accepted tradition among contemporary Northist and Southist scholars who generally believe them to be the consequence of rivalry between the St. Thomas Christians and Knanaya. In most of these variants, the Southists' ancestor was Thomas' Syrian wife, while the Northists' was an indigenous St. Thomas Christian or Nair woman who became his second wife or concubine, implying that the Southists are Thomas' true heirs. In other variants, both wives were Kerala natives, while the Southists' forebearer was from a higher caste. 

Some Northist historically maintained versions which countered this assertion, claiming that the Knanaya descend from a "dobi" (washerwoman); in some versions of this story, she became Thoma's concubine, while in others she married a lower-caste Maaran boy. This assertion is based on the 1676 Portuguese document "M.S Sloane 2748-A", a likely forgery attributed to the Carmelite priest Father Mathew.

Historian of medieval India and Northist priest Pius Malekandathil argues that the two-wives legend was simply a creation of rivalry between the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya and the Native St. Thomas Christians. Malekandathil expresses that the story originated in the medieval era due to the two ethnic groups of Christians asserting socioeconomic dominance over the other. Furthermore, Malekandathil notes that the two-wives legend is not the accepted tradition among the people of Kerala but instead that the indigenous Saint Thomas Christians got the appellation "Northists" because they were initially located on the northern part of the city of Cranganore, while the migrant Knanaya under the leadership of Thomas of Cana were given the southern side of the city which led to the generic title of "Southists".

White hole

A white hole is a hypothetical region in spacetime. It has "not" been proven to exist.

It is said to be the exact opposite of a black hole. While a black hole sucks in objects to its singularity, the white hole emits matter from its singularity. A white hole may be formed after a black hole can no longer suck things in. Immediately, it turns into a white hole and starts emitting the things that it has previously sucked in before. Nothing can enter a white hole as its emitting force is too great. In this sense, it is the reverse of a black hole, which can be entered only from the outside and from which energy-matter, light and information cannot escape.

Like black holes, white holes have properties like mass, charge, and angular momentum. They attract matter like any other mass, but objects falling towards a white hole would never actually reach the white hole's event horizon.

Phumulani

Phumulani is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing domestic violence and sexual abuse in communities of color throughout Minnesota and globally.

Phumulani was founded by Comfort Dondo, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and domestic violence. Born and raised in Zimbabwe and now residing in Minnesota, Comfort’s struggle with domestic violence was compounded by the inability of women’s shelters in America to provide the language, cultural and societal resources she and her children needed to feel safe and supported. Often, she found herself back in her abuser’s home with no alternative. 

Now free from the dangerous situation, Comfort wants to make sure women and children of African descent have the cultural resources they need to feel comfortable in sharing their stories and recovering from their experiences. She understands firsthand that individuals who have fled African countries to save their lives often have lasting trauma that needs to be acknowledged and treated holistically to ensure long-term progress. 

"Comfort created Phumulani, named for a Zulu word meaning “refuge,” as a way of helping African immigrants and refugees in Minnesota. It is truly a place where survivors of gender-based abuse and violence can find peace and recovery."

To stop violence and abuse of women and children. Phumulani is a non-profit organization dedicated to preventing domestic violence and sexual abuse in communities of color throughout Minnesota and the nation. By providing culturally-specific resources to women and girls of African descent, we hope to change the cycle of gender-based abuse in the vulnerable populations.

(524522) 2002 VE68

(524522) 2002 VE is an asteroid and a temporary quasi-satellite of Venus. It was the first quasi-satellite to be found around a planet in the Solar System. It looks like it travels around Venus during one Venerean year but it actually orbits the Sun, not Venus.

It was discovered on 11 November 2002 at Lowell Observatory. It has a semi-major axis of 0.7237 AU. Its eccentricity is 0.4104. Its orbital inclination is 9.0060°. It is calculated to measure 236 meters in diameters. Its rotational period is 13.5 hours.

Digital distribution

Digital distribution (also named content delivery), is the delivery (through downloading) of any digital content, including audio, e-books, games, PDFs, pictures, software, and video. Digital distribution is handled through a digital distribution platform that's designed to stream the digital content or allow the content to be downloaded in full. 

The primary behavior of online distribution is its direct nature of distribution. 

To make a commercially successful work, artists usually must enter their industry's publishing chain. Publishers help artists advertise, fund and distribute their work to retail outlets. In some industries, particularly video games, artists find themselves bound to publishers, and in many cases unable to make the content they want; the publisher might not think it will profit well. This can quickly lead to the standardization of the content and to the stifling of new, potentially risky ideas.

By opting for online distribution, an artist can get their work into the public sphere of interest easily with potentially minimum business overhead. This often leads to cheaper goods for the consumer, increased profits for the artists, as well as increased artistic freedom. Online distribution platforms typically contain or act as a form of digital rights management.

Online distribution also opens the door to new business models (e.g., the Open Music Model). For instance, an artist could release one track from an album or one chapter from a book at a time instead of waiting for them all to be completed. This either gives them a cash boost to help continue their projects or indicates that their work might not be financially viable. This is hopefully done before they have spent excessive money and time on a project deemed to remain unprofitable. Video games have increased flexibility in this area, demonstrated by micropayment models. A clear result of these new models is their accessibility to smaller artists or artist teams who do not have the time, funds, or expertise to make a new product in one go.

An example of this can be found in the music industry. Indie artists may access the same distribution channels as major record labels, with potentially fewer restrictions and manufacturing costs. There is a growing collection of 'Internet labels' that offer distribution to unsigned or independent artists directly to online music stores, and in some cases marketing and promotion services. Further, many bands are able to bypass this completely, and offer their music for sale via their own independently controlled websites.

An issue is the large number of incompatible formats in which content is delivered, restricting the devices that may be used, or making data conversion necessary.

225088 Gonggong

225088 Gonggong (symbol ) is a dwarf planet of the Solar System. It is a member of the scattered disc. It has a highly eccentric orbit. It is from 34–101 astronomical units (5.1–15.1 billion kilometers; 3.2–9.4 billion miles) from the Sun. It is the sixth-farthest known Solar System object. Gonggong was discovered in July 2007 by American astronomers Megan Schwamb, Michael Brown, and David Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory, and the discovery was announced in January 2009.

The surface of Gonggong has an albedo of 0.14. Gonggong is among the reddest trans-Neptunian objects known. Its red color is suprising because it has a lot of water ice on its surface, which are usually neutral in color. Scientists think that there might be methane on its surface which will explain its red color.

Gonggong is estimated to have a diameter of 1,230 km (760 mi). This would make Gonggong the fifth-largest trans-Neptunian object, after Pluto, Eris, Haumea and Makemake. Gonggong is approximately the size of Pluto's moon Charon.

The mass of Gonggong has been calculated to be 1.75×10 kg (3.86×10 lb). It has a density of 1.72±0.16 g/cm.

Gonggong orbits the Sun at an average distance of 67.5 AU (1.010×10 km; 6.27×10 mi). It completes a full orbit in 554 years. It has an orbital inclination 30.7 degrees. Its eccentricity is 0.50.

Gonggong is moving away at a speed of 1.1 kilometers per second (2,500 miles per hour). It is the sixth-farthest known Solar System object from the Sun.

It was calculated by planetary scientist Amanda Zangari that a flyby mission to Gonggong would take a minimum of over 20 years with the rocket we have today. A flyby mission would be launched on 2030 or 2031.

Gonggong is known to have a moon, called Xiangliu. The discovery team thought that the slow rotation of Gonggong was caused by a moon

North Korean defectors

North Korean defectors are North Korean people who left North Korea to become citizens in a new country. In North Korea, it is against the law to leave North Korea without permission. North Koreans are also not allowed to change their own citizenship, so anyone born a North Korean must also die a North Korean. The punishment for leaving North Korea without permission is extremely harsh. People who are caught are usually sent a prison camp or put to death in public. Like many other crimes in North Korea, illegally leaving the country may not only punish the accused, but also his or her family up to three generations.

Although the punishments for illegally leaving North Korea are extremely harsh, the number who try to leave the country is still somewhat high. This is because North Koreans are so poor and have so little freedom that defectors believe finding a better life in a new country is worth risking their lives for it. Since the North Korean famine in the 1990s, more than 30,000 North Koreans have successfully left and have come to South Korea. Some sources say that somewhere between 100,000 to 300,000 North Koreans escaped into Russia or China since 1953. Of the defectors who came to South Korea, more than 70% are women. 

The goal of most defectors is to get to South Korea because the South Korean constitution allows South Korean citizenship to anyone born in either North or South Korea. However, the way to get to South Korea is so difficult that most defectors never made it there. There are many different ways to get to South Korea, and all are difficult. However, some are more difficult than others.

One possible way is to cross the North-South Korea border through the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). However, most defectors do not take this route because it is extremely deadly. The DMZ has many landmines, tanks, electric wires, machine gun towers, and guards on both sides. In fact, North Korean soldiers have orders to kill any North Korean trying to cross the border. In some cases, South Korean soldiers have actually rescued some North Koreans crossing the border. Only 21 of the 33,000 defectors have crossed the DMZ and lived through it. Almost all of these were North Korean soldiers who had some knowledge of the DMZ.

There were at least two defectors who successfully swam to Japan.

However, most defectors begin their escape through China. This is because the Tumen and Yalu Rivers (the rivers that make up the China-North Korea border) are much easier and safer to cross. However, most defectors do not stay in China because they are still in danger. Most defectors caught by the China government are either sent back to North Korea, where they would most likely be killed, or be sold as a wife or a sex slave in China. This is why most North Korean defectors try to go into second country before finally coming to South Korea. These countries include Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.

There is also a sizeable community of North Korean defectors in the United States (mostly people who who fled to South Korea during the Korean War and later emigrated to the USA). Since the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 which allowed North Korean defectors to be admitted as refugees, about 130 people have settled in the U.S. under such status.

Pyramid of Neferirkare

The Pyramid of Neferirkare was built for the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai in the 25th century BC. 

It was the tallest structure on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir, between Giza and Saqqara. It still towers over the necropolis. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir Papyri.

The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom.

Pyramids of the era were smaller and became more standardized. There was still intricate relief decoration. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid. That design that had gone out of date after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). 

The pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the haste, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. 

The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are in the surrounds.

(307261) 2002 MS4

(307261) 2002 MS is a large classical Kuiper belt object. It is a possible dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It was discovered in 2002 by Chad Trujillo and Michael Brown.

The Spitzer Space Telescope estimated it to have a diameter of 726±123 km, while the Herschel Space Telescope estimated it to be 934±47 km.

2002 MS does not have any known moons orbiting it, thus an accurate mass estimate cannot be made. Based on its size, Brown lists it as nearly certain to be a dwarf planet, however, its low albedo may imply the opposite: dark, mid-sized bodies such as this, less than about 1000 km in diameter and with albedos less than about 0.2, have likely never collapsed into solid bodies, much less differentiated or relaxed into hydrostatic equilibrium, and thus are unlikely to be dwarf planets.

As of 2019, the rotation period of 2002 MS is unknown. Observations in 2005 and 2011 showed possible periods of either 7.33 hours or its alias 10.44 hours (single-peaked), or twice those values for the double-peaked solution, with a small light curve amplitude of 0.05±0.01 mag. Light curve observations of 2002 MS are difficult because of the dense field of background stars it is crossing. Observations made in June and July 2011 took advantage of 2002 MS moving in front of a dark nebula.

Lactic acid bacteria

Lactic acid bacteria are bacteria which make lactic acid. This is an end product of carbohydrate fermentation. The bacteria change carbohydrates to lactic acid and energy. 

The bacteria are the order "Lactobacillales." Most of them are anaerobic: they do not need oxygen. Usually, they can live well in acidic environments. They are either rod-shaped, or spherical. They are found in decomposing plants and milk products. 

Lactic acid bacteria are important, and they are common. There are about 40 genera. Some species occur in the gut of animals, including humans. Several lactic acid bacteria are pathogens: they cause infectious diseases.

Lactic acid fermentation has been used since the Stone Age. It makes food last longer, and be easier to digest. Lactic acid fermentation is used in the production of cheese and yogurt.

Adult humans originally could not digest milk products. Then, all humans were lactose intolerant (as, for example, cats are after weaning). "Lactase persistence" is the phenotype where genes prolonging the activity of lactase beyond infancy. Humans are unusual in having lactase persistence. We know it evolved fairly recently (in the last 10,000 years) among some populations. Still, "most people worldwide are lactase nonpersistent". They cannot digest lactose products after weaning. The evidence is that lactose persistence grew in human groups who herded cattle. To them it was a great advantage: they could digest milk throughout life.

Bronisław Malinowski

Bronisław Malinowski (April 7, 1884 - May 16, 1942) was a well known British sociocultural anthropologist. He is most famous for his work on the Trobriand Islands, creating a formal ethnographic process, and for coming up with the idea of functionalism. 
Malinowski was born in Kraków, Poland on April 7th, 1884. He was raised in an aristocratic family. His father, Lucjan, was a professor of philosophy at a Polish university and a linguist who worked on Polish folklore. His mother, Jozefa, was also a linguist. Most of Malinowksi’s early education was learned at home. He traveled around the Mediterranean region with his mother when he was a teenager. 

In 1908, Malinowski received his PhD in physics and mathematics from the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland. In 1910, Malinowski moved to England to study anthropology at the London School of Economics (LSE). At LSE, Malinowski was taught by Charles Seligman, a British physician and ethnologist who did fieldwork in New Guinea. He was also taught by Edward Westermarck, a Finnish philosopher and sociologist who studied exogamy and the incest taboo. In 1916, Malinowski received a D.Sc. in anthropology from the University of London. 

Malinowski began his fieldwork in 1914, when he traveled to New Guinea to study the Mailu. His first ethnographic report on this fieldwork, "The Native of the Mailu", was written in 1915. Malinowski had trouble working with the Mailu because he could not speak their language and did not live with them, which limited his understanding of their culture. Because of this, Malinowski started new fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands in 1915. 

From 1915-1916 and 1917-1918, Malinowski did intense fieldwork on the Trobriand Islands, which helped him collect enough information to write multiple ethnographic reports. His most famous work about the Trobriand Islands, written in 1922, was "Argonauts of the Western Pacific". In this book, Malinowksi wrote about the Trobriand Kula Ring, a trade ring that enforced life-long relationships between neighboring groups. 

Malinowksi wrote many works about his fieldwork in the Western Pacific. These works include:


Malinowski retired from fieldwork in 1918. He lectured on ethnology at the London School of Economics (LSE) from 1921-1923 and was offered a full time position at the university in 1923. In 1927, Malinowksi was made the Chair of Social Anthropology. During his time at LSE, Malinowksi taught many students who would later become well-known anthropologists themselves. These students included E.E. Evans-Pritchard, Ashley Montagu, Eslanda Goode Robeson, Godfrey Wilson, and Audrey Richards. Malinowski continued to work at LSE until 1938, when he moved to the United States. While living in the United States, Malinowksi worked as a professor at Yale University until his death in 1942. 

Malinowksi made two major contributions to the field of anthropology. The first was his theory of functionalism. Malinowksi claimed that culture groups needed to meet the individual needs of their people in order to function properly. These individual needs can range anywhere from food and shelter to the need for security and happiness. The Kula Ring is great example of the concept of functionalism. It uses gift-giving as a way to fulfill the need for political organization among the Trobriand people. People who received the best Kula gifts, red-shelled necklaces or white-shelled armbands, were given a higher social rank in Trobriand society.

His second major contribution was creating a formal ethnographic process. Malinowski believed that an anthropologist needed to live with the people that they were studying. He placed a strong emphasis on participant observation because it allowed anthropologists to learn local languages and customs, which would be helpful when writing up ethnographic reports.

Agamy

Agamy is a relational model consisting of the non-pair formation, where there is no partner. It's the status of not engaging in relationships or marriages, sometimes not even in sexual reproduction.

Casus belli

Casus belli is a Latin phrase for an event or a situation that directly provokes a war. Note that the plural of the phrase is also casus belli. If this was an aggression in the sense of international law, the country is allowed to start a war in self-defence. It is common to provoke an aggressor, so as to be able to legally start a war. Examples of this are the Arrow incident that started the Second Opium War, or the Maine incident, which led the United states to annex Cuba and the Philippines from the Spanish Empire. The Iraq War was started by the US and its allies, on the pretext that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Years after the war, it turned out he didn't have any. Another example: the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was the casus belli for the First World War.

The design features three horizontal bands of orange, white and blue with three small flags (the flag of the United Kingdom to the left, the vertical version of the flag of the Orange Free State in the centre and the flag of the South African Republic to the right) centered on the white band. Because of its colours it was known as the Oranje, Blanje, Blou (Afrikaans for Orange, White, Blue) by citizens.

The flag is viewed as a symbol of apartheid and white supremacy, since 2019 it is illegal to display this flag in public in South Africa and is classified as a hate speech. This ruling is seen as a political move on the part of the ANC government, who has been ruling the country since 1994. The banning of the Oranje, Blanje, Blou is challenged by many in the South African Supreme Court of Appeal.

Baculum

The baculum (also penis bone), is a bone found in the penis of many male mammals. It is absent in the human penis, but present in the penises of our close relatives the apes, such as the gorilla and chimpanzee.
The bone is located along the top of the penis and it aids in sex by keeping it stiff for a long time during the sex act. 

A bone in the penis allows a male to mate for a much longer time with a female. This can be an advantage as it prevents a rival male from having sex with the female for some time.

Male animals without a penis bone tend to form close emotional bonds with a female and so ensure they are the father of her offspring.

Boundary (cricket)

In cricket, the boundary is the edge of the field. A rope is usually put on the boundary to show where it is. The word "boundary" can also mean the runs scored (either 4 or 6) when the ball touches the boundary or the ground outside the boundary.

In international cricket, the boundaries of the field are about or more from the center of the field.

If the ball is in play and touches the boundary or the ground outside of the field, then it is worth at least four runs, and the ball becomes dead (no longer in play). If the ball was hit by the batter, and didn't touch the ground in the field before or when it became dead, then it is worth six runs. If a fielder throws the ball at the boundary or the ground beyond the boundary, then four runs are scored as "overthrows" in addition to any runs the batters had already scored by running.

If the ball touches a fielder who is touching the boundary or the ground beyond the boundary, then it is treated as if the ball has touched the boundary. The same goes for when the ball touches a fielder who is in the air who touched the boundary or the ground beyond the boundary immediately before going in the air, if the fielder had not legally touched the ball before.

When a boundary is scored, any runs the batters scored by running do not count, unless the batters had scored more runs by running than the number of runs scored by the boundary; when this happens, the runs scored by the boundary do not count.

The Laws of Cricket allow the teams and umpires to agree to change the number of runs scored by the two types of boundaries before the game.

Four runs are scored when the ball touches the ground in the field and then touches the boundary or the ground beyond the boundary.

Six runs are scored when the ball touches the boundary, or the ground beyond the boundary, without having touched the ground in the field.

Neutrois

Neutrois is a non-binary gender identity that is usually associated with gender neutrality or the nullification of gender.

Beyblade: Metal Fusion

Beyblade: Metal Fusion, or also known as Metal Fight Beyblade (メタルファイトベイブレード "Metarufaitobeiburēdo") in Japan and other Asia regions, is the first anime of the "Metal Saga". It was succeeded by "Beyblade: Metal Masters (Metal Fight Beyblade Explosion)".

Beyblade: Metal Fusion is adapted from the first four volumes of the manga, "Metal Fight Beyblade". The manga the anime is based on was a reboot of the Beyblade franchise. As such, both anime and manga have nothing to do with the Bakuten Shoot Beyblade series before it.




Gingka Hagane. A young beyblader who is searching the hidden secrets of his past, with his partner Storm Pegasus. On a training journey, Gingka Hagane stumbles upon Metal Bey City, where he meets a bunch of friends and interesting rivals. What happens when Gingka and his friends set off on the journey of defeating the Dark Nebula organization? How will Gingka Hagane defeat Ryuga and his forbidden bey, Lightning L-Drago.

The series follows the adventures of Gingka Hagane, a beyblader who is searching for his hidden past while trying to defeat the evil Dark Nebula organization and Ryuga, a man with the Forbidden Bey known as Lightning L-Drago.

The plot varies between the manga and anime with several differences. One notable difference is that in the manga, the Beys transform for their upgrades, while in the anime, the characters just switch parts or get an entirely new Bey. Another difference is that, in the manga, the characters started with the Metal System (4-piece top), while in the anime they started with the Hybrid Wheel System (5-piece top).

Partnership (cricket)

In cricket, two batsmen (scoring players) are on the field at a time. They are in a partnership. Each batsman is in one of the two batsmen's grounds during their team's scoring turn. When the two batsmen run between the grounds, they score one run for each time both batsmen swap grounds. When neither batsmen is in one of the grounds, their opponents can hit the wicket in that ground with the ball to temporarily prevent the batsmen from scoring more runs, and run out the batsman nearest that ground. The batsman who is in the ground at the striker's end of the pitch at the start of a delivery is the one who attempts to hit the ball during that delivery, while the other batsman only runs.

Every time one of the two batsmen on the field gets out, another batsman enters the field and has a new partnership with the batsman who did not get out. Each partnership is named by looking at the number of batters who were out before and after the partnership; for example, the partnership between the two batsmen who are on the field when only one batter on the team is out is called the "second-wicket partnership", because it happens after the team has lost 1 wicket (had 1 batter get out), but before the loss of the team's second wicket. Because of this, it rarely happens that a batter retires (leaves the field without being out) and a new batter enters the field without changing the number of the partnership.

Glottal stop

The glottal stop (or glottal plosive) is a type of consonant. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is . The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is ⟨?⟩. In English, this sound is found in a few accents. One example is the break in "uh-oh".

Features of the glottal stop:


When many languages, such as Arabic, are Romanized (which means they are written with the Latin alphabet instead of their usual writing system), the glottal stop is written with the apostrophe or the symbol ʾ. This is where the IPA letter comes from. In many Polynesian languages that use the Latin alphabet, the glottal stop is written with a rotated apostrophe, . This letter is called "‘okina" in Hawaiian and Samoan. In Malay the glottal stop is written with the letter (at the end of words). In Võro and Maltese, it is written with .

Other writing systems also have letters for the glottal stop. For example, the Hebrew alphabet uses the letter aleph . Cyrillic has the letter palochka . This letter is used in several Caucasian languages. Modern Latin alphabets for some Indigenous Languages of the Caucasus use the letter heng ('Ꜧ ꜧ'). In Tundra Nenets, it is written with the letters apostrophe and double apostrophe . In Japanese, glottal stops occur at the end of interjections of surprise or anger and are written with .

When most Philippine languages are written, the glottal stop is not written all the time. Usually, a word that begins with a vowel (for example, Tagalog , "dog") is always pronounced with a glottal stop before that vowel. (This also happens in Modern German and Hausa.) This glottal stop is not written. Some orthographies (or ways of writing words) use a hyphen instead of the reverse apostrophe if the glottal stop is in the middle of the word (e.g. Tagalog , "love"; or Visayan "gabi-i", "night"). If it is at the end of a word, the last vowel is written with a circumflex accent (known as the "pakupyâ") if the last vowel is stressed and there is a glottal stop in the final vowel (for example, "basâ", "wet"). If the stress is on the penultimate, or second-to-last, syllable, then a grave accent (known as the "paiwà") is used (for example, "batà", "child").

Some Canadian indigenous languages, especially some of the Salishan languages, use the letter ʔ itself as part of their writing systems. In some of them, there are uppercase and lowercase letters for the glottal stop: Ɂ and ɂ. The number 7 or question mark is sometimes used instead of ʔ. Some languages, such as Squamish, use this instead of ʔ. SENĆOŦEN uses the comma to write the glottal stop. However, this is optional in SENĆOŦEN.

In 2015, two women challenged the government of the Northwest Territories. They wanted to use the ʔ character in their daughters' names: Sahaiʔa, a Chipewyan name, and Sakaeʔah, a Slavey name. The government told them that the identity documents the government uses could not have the letter ʔ on them. Because of this, the women instead used hyphens in their daughters' names. After this, they continued to challenge the government.

In the Crow language, the glottal stop is written as a question mark: ?. The only time the glottal stop is used in Crow is as a question marker morpheme, at the end of a sentence. (A question marker makes a sentence into a question.)

Spherical cow

A spherical cow is a metaphor that is used when a complex scientific model is made more simple than it really should be.

The words "spherical cow" came from a joke where a dairy farmer talks to a theoretical physicist about how to get more prices for his milk.

The no-hair theorem is about black holes. 
Black holes can be described by just three visible properties: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum, or spin. 

The theory itself was first stated by Werner Israel, a Canadian physicist. Then John Archibald Wheeler said that black holes have no hairs. This gave the idea its name.

CentOS was acquired by Red Hat in 2014. On December 8, 2020, it was announced that the CentOS project, previously a downstream branch of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, would be moving to CentOS Stream, an upstream development branch of RHEL. 

The maintenance schedule for CentOS 8 was also changed, ending full updates and maintenance updates on December 31, 2021. As an aside, the maintenance schedule for CentOS 7 is unchanged, with maintenance updates ending on June 30, 2024.

A mother goddess is a goddess that is a personification of motherhood, or of fertility. Sometimes, they are called mother earth or earth mother. This concept is usually coupled with a sky father, or father sky. Very often, the mother goddess is also the mother of other deities.

Dynamical system

A Dynamical system is a mathematical model of a process, that is dependent on time. The process is homogeneous, it only depends on the initial state. The current terminology was established by Henri Poincaré and George David Birkhoff. 

Dynamical systems are very common. Examples are the movement of a pendulum in physics, or the predator-prey equations in biology.

Predator-prey equations

The predator-prey equations is an ecological system. Two linked equations model the two species which depend on each other: One is the prey, which provides food for the other, the predator. Both prey and predator populations grow if conditions are right. Alfred J. Lotka found these equations in 1925. Vito Volterra found them, independently, in 1926. For this reason, the equations are also called Lotka-Volterra equations.

The equations themselves are non-linear differential equations. 
There are a number of pre-conditions

In this case the solution of the differential equations is deterministic and continuous. This means that the generations of both the predator and prey are overlapping all the time.

The solutions to the equations lead to the Lotka-Volterra rules:


Consider two populations whose sizes at a reference time t are denoted by x(t), y(t), respectively. The functions x and y might might denote population numbers or concentration (number per area) or some other scaled measure of the population sizes, but are taken to be continuous functions. Changes in population size with time are describing by the time derivatives formula_1 and formula_2, respectively.

In one of his books, Volterra provided statistics on the number of certain cartilagenous fish caught at some Italian ports in the Mediterranean. Volterra used the term "sélaciens", which refers to sharks. These often prey on other fish. In the table, Volterra provided numbers for 1905, and 1910 to 1923:

He observed that between 1915 and 1920, more of these fish were caught. He expained this as follows: During the First World War, less fishing was done. For this reason, there were more prey animals, so the number of predators increased. After the war, fishing increased again, reducing the number of prey animals. This also led to a decrease in the number of predators, which can be seen in the table above.

The use of the first Lotka-Volerra rule in economics is known as the pork cycle.

The predator-prey equations have also been the foundation of other work. Volterra himself extended it to be able to model intraspecific competition. Intraspecific competition occurs when two aninimals of the same species compete for limited resources. Intraspecific competition is an important factor to regulate population density. It is also important to be able to adapt to a changing environment (and for evoution). Volterra did this by adding new terns to the equation.

Most of Volerra's work is about extending the model to be able to handle more than two classes of animals interacting.




Bat Trang Pottery Village

Bat Trang is a historic village in Vietnam, famous for making traditional pottery and ceramics. Bat Trang Village is a popular tourist destination in North Vietnam. The famous village produces and trades many kinds of ceramics inside and outside the country.

Bat Trang pottery village was established about 1000 years ago in the Red River Delta region of Vietnam. Located in an area rich in white clay, the people of the village had the advantage of producing pottery. Five famous pottery families of Bo Bat village (now Ninh Bình Province) came and brought pottery artisans to Bat Trang village. The five families and the Nguyen family of Bat Trang opened the first pottery production kilns in the village. About the 12th century, Hua Vinh Kieu learned some new techniques of pottery production from Guangdong Province in China and taught Bat Trang pottery makers how to make a white glaze.
Bat Trang village has produced pottery since the 11th century. During the 11th and 12th centuries, the Ly Emperors chose the Bat Trang pottery as a tribute for the Chinese Emperor. The village has about 80 percent of the 1200 kilns that had fired ceramics since the village was established. Throughout the years, the village's products have become more diversified. Bat Trang potteries are well-known and have gained popularity in many countries.

Bat Trang products are classified into three different kinds depending on their usage.

•           Household items: plates, bowls, teacups, kettles, wine bottles, flowerpots, vases, jars, cups, pots, etc.

•           Religious items: lamp stands, candle holders, incense burners, altar boxes, swords, etc.

•           Decorative objects: altars, statues, and architectural fixtures.

Since the village was established, most residents there have been involved in the pottery business. The economy of the village now depends on tourism and sales of the pottery. Besides making income, the people also want to teach the craft and to keep the old skills alive.

Bat Trang ceramic village has become popular with tourists. Visitors can study the history, culture, and traditional worth of each of the handicraft products.

Bat Trang village festival is organized from the 14th to 16th day of the second lunar month each year. The festival brings various special activities to honor the first pottery making. The people of the village have some traditional games such as  "xiangqi" (or Chinese chess), chessboard, tug of war, choir. Many special ceramic products of the village's best craftsmen are displayed at the time.
The largest Bat Trang pottery market displays and sells many ceramic products of the village. Visitors can buy and learn to make pottery products. Located at the entrance to Bat Trang village, the market covers an area of about 20,000 feet (6000 meters).

Acculturation

is a term used to describe how an individual or a group from one culture interacts directly with an individual or group from a different culture.e

 Psychologists have also been interested in studying acculturation but are interested in the effects of acculturation on individuals. Sociologists also study acculturation and how societies change from interacting with new cultures. 

The process of acculturation can have four outcomes: assimilation, integration, separation, and marginalization. These four outcomes are shown in the picture to the right. 


Anthropologists, Psychologists, and Sociologists all use acculturation to help explain changes that happen when cultures interact. One way of measuring levels of acculturation is through acculturative stress. This measurement helps relate acculturation to other ideas or issues and helps researchers understand what happens to individuals and groups during acculturation. Many studies have looked at acculturative stress and health of individuals. Other acculturation research studies have focused on immigrant populations to the United States and other minority groups.

The strike was jointly called by ten central trade unions – Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS), Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC), Trade Union Co-ordination Centre (TUCC), Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) and All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), Labour Progressive Federation (LPF) and United Trade Union Congress (UTUC).

All over the country, both public and private sector employees participated in the strike.

Farmers are protesting against recent anti-farmer laws which would withdraw the government’s minimum support price for farm products, with serious implications for farmers’ income and livelihoods. 

The unions protested against the three new Labour Codes – the Industrial Relations Code Bill, 2020; the Code on Social Security Bill, 2020; and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code Bill, 2020 – that were passed by both houses of the Parliament earlier in 2020.

Usually, the one winning the competition has a better fitness, and may better be able to reproduce. Examples for resources are food, water, space, light, or mates.

Dog of Death

"Dog of Death" is the 19th episode of "The Simpsons" 3rd season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on March 12, 1992. In the episode, Santa's Little Helper gets ill. The Simpson family must find ways to pay for an operation for Santa's Little Helper. 

The episode was written by John Swartzwelder. Jim Reardon is the director of the episode. The episode was made because writers of "The Simpsons" liked making stories with Santa's Little Helper. The episode got a Nielsen rating of 14.2. It had the best ratings on Fox for the week it was broadcast.

People in the town of Springfield are very excited for the lottery. The Simpson family is so excited that they do not see that Santa's Little Helper is ill. Kent Brockman wins the lottery and gets $130 million. The family finds Santa's Little Helper and takes him to a hospital. They learn that he has a twisted stomach (GDV) and needs an operation for $750. Homer tells Bart and Lisa that they do not have enough money for the operation. However, he sees that Santa's Little Helper is loved, so he thinks of a way to get money for the operation.

To get money, The Simpson family must give up many things they like to do. Homer has to stop getting beer. Bart has to get hair cuts from a barber for free. Marge has to use food that is less quality and must stop getting lottery tickets. Lisa must stop getting parts of the book series she likes. Maggie has to have her old clothes fixed and not get new ones. After this, they get enough money for the operation.

The operation goes well and the Simpson family is happy to have Santa's Little Helper healthy. However, they start to get mad at him because of what they had to give up. Santa's Little Helper feels sad and runs away from their house. He is put in an animal shelter and adopted by Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns trains him to be an attack dog. Santa's Little Helper is brainwashed and is made an angry attack dog.

The Simpson family can not find Santa's Little Helper and starts to feel sad. Bart looks for him in many houses. He goes to Mr. Burns' mansion and sees him. Santa's Little Helper starts attacking Bart. However, Santa's Little Helper starts to think of happy times he had with Bart. He is then happy to see Bart and keeps him safe from Burns' other attack dogs. He goes back to the Simpson family and is shown love.

The episode was written by John Swartzwelder. Jim Reardon is the director of the episode. Producers wanted to make another episode about Santa's Little Helper. They liked the ones they made before, for example, "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". Reardon says that one of the hardest parts of making the episode is that Santa's Little Helper has to act like a real dog. Producers wanted to show animals act as how they do in real life and not show human features. The story of the episode is similar to an event with Swartzwelder's dog. The "Gold Coast Bulletin" said that the Simpson family's problem with the price of the operation is a "very real" problem. They said that many families do not help with simple health for their dogs.

The episode was first shown on the Fox network in the United States on March 12, 1992. It got better ratings than "The Cosby Show". "The Simpsons" and "The Cosby Show" have been in a competition that started in the 2nd season. The episode got a Nielsen rating of 14.2. It had the best ratings on Fox for the week it was broadcast.

Colin Jacobson from DVD Movie Guide said it is "possibly the funniest "Clockwork Orange" parody I've ever seen". Nate Meyers from Digitally Obsessed thought that the reference is "brilliant".

Tom Adair from "The Scotsman" thought of it as a classic episode. Nate Meyers thought that fans would not like the episode as much as others. However, he said "there are enough laughs to keep the audience entertained." Colin Jacobson said the episode is a "terrific program" and talks about how the story makes the episode humorous. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood (authors of "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide") loved many parts of the episode. They talked about Homer's dream of winning the lottery, the reference to "A Clockwork Orange", and a parody of the phrase "No Animals Were Harmed".

Bill Gibron from DVD Verdict talked about many parts of the story and how they make the best events of "The Simpsons". Nathan Rabin from "The A.V. Club" said that the part with Santa's Little Helper seeing Bart again was not as good as it could have been. He thinks that Santa's Little Helper is not made as good of a character as others.

Interspecific competition

In ecology, interspecific competition is when individuals of different species compete for the same resources, in an ecosystem. Examples for such resources are food, or space. Even species that never meet can compete with each other, because they need the same resources: Two kinds of predators might prey on the same animals. Interspecific competition is important, because it regulates the population of the different species. It is one of the ways natural selection happens. Interspecific competition causes evolution. 

When two individuals of the same species compete, this is called intraspecific competition.

In the episode, the Simpson family goes to China so that Selma can adopt a baby there. Lucy Liu guest stars as Madam Wu, a Chinese person in the episode who helps with Selma's adoption. 

The episode was controversial in China because it made references of the Tiananmen Square protests. In the episode, a sign in the Tiananmen Square says "On this site, in 1989, nothing happened". This is a reference to China trying to censor the protests. Another part of the episode shows a parody of the Tank Man photo where Selma is the Tank Man and Wu is inside one of the tanks. In 2021, Hong Kong started their version of Disney+ which has "The Simpsons". "Goo Goo Gai Pan" was not put on there because of its references to the Tianamen Square protests.

Forgetting curve

The forgetting curve is an idea from psychology, that shows how rapidly people forget things, if they do nothing to retain them. German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered it. A related concept is the strength of memory: People with a stronger memory are able to remember things longer. Ebbinghaus tested how long he could remember random syllables, and recorded the results in his paper "Über das Gedächtnis" (1885). In 1913, this was translated into English as Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology". Ebbinghaus studied the memorisation of nonsense syllables, such as "WID" and "ZOF" (CVCs or Consonant–Vowel–Consonant) by repeatedly testing himself after various time periods and recording the results. He plotted these results on a graph creating what is now known as the "forgetting curve". Ebbinghaus investigated the rate of forgetting, but not the effect of spaced repetition on the increase in retrievability of memories.

As a rough guide, after 20 minutes, people can only recall about 60% of what they memorized. After a week, only about 15% is left. When Ebbinghaus did the experiment, he used meaningless sequences of syllables. In the 20th century, several other researchers repeated the experiment. One of them was Georg Elias Müller. For this reason, the results are still considered to be valid.

To be able to remember things better, more repetitions are needed. Things that are needed and used more often, will not be forgotten so easily.

Hermann Ebbinghaus

Hermann Ebbinghaus (24 January 1850 – 26 February 1909) was a German psychologist. Today, he is mostly known for his work regarding learning and forgetting. He was the first to do experiments to explore how memory works. He first described the forgetting curve, the learning curve and the spacing effect. The Ebbinghaus illusion, which is named after him is related to the perception, not memory. His son was the philosopher Julius Ebbinghaus. 

In 1896, he did a test on children in school: The pupils had to complete sentences, and their teacher had to rate each pupil, if the pupil was in the lowest, the middle or the highest third of all the people in the class. Ebbinghaus saw a relationship between the teacher's rating, and the result of the pupil, but he could not give a correlation (because he was lacking the tools to do so). This was possibly the first test of verbal intelligence in a group. 

Many of his experimental methods to rate memory performance are still in use.

Ebbinghaus died of pneumonia, when he was 59 years old.

Even though Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had won the district two years earlier, Hurd winning was seen as an upset. Hurd conducted a post-election swing through some parts of his district that had heavily supported Gallego.

Qisas

Qisas or Qiṣāṣ () is a term interpreted to mean "retaliation in kind", "eye for an eye", or retributive justice. 

Qisas was a practice used as a resolution tool in inter-tribal conflicts in pre-Islamic Arab society. The basis of this practice was that a member of the tribe to which the murderer belonged was handed over to the victim's family for execution, equivalent to the social status of the murdered person. The condition of "social equivalence" meant the execution of a member of the murderer's tribe who was equivalent to the murdered, in that the murdered person was male or female, slave or free, elite or commonplace. For example, only one slave can be killed for a slave, and a woman can be killed for a woman. On this pre-islamic understandings the discussion "whether a Muslim could be executed for a non-Muslim" was added in Islamic period.

In historical practice, qisas appears in two forms. One of them is, the punishment of the perpetrator "with the same act" in crimes "committed against the physical integrity of the person, such as a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth". Another application is related to the social status of the perpetrator and the victim. In the tribal understanding, when a person kills a woman, a slave or an honorable person from another tribe, a person "of similar status from the tribe to which the murderer belongs" will be killed in return. As a general custom, killing the master's to slave, father's to child, husband's to wife was not punished with retaliation, and retaliation was not applied to the man who killed the woman as a rule. The condition of "social equality" in qisas means that; "if a socially inferior person kills someone from the upper class, qisas will be applied", whereas "if someone from the upper class kills someone from the lower class, it cannot be applied". 

In this case, compensation can be paid to the family of the murdered person.

The main verse for implementation in Islam is Al Baqara; 178 verse;
": "'Believers! Retaliation is ordained for you regarding the people who were killed. Free versus free, captive versus captive, woman versus woman. Whoever is forgiven by the brother of the slain for a price, let him abide by the custom and pay the price well."

In traditional Islamic law ("sharia"), the doctrine of qisas allows a punishment analogous to the crime. Qisas is available to the victim or victim's heirs against a person convicted of murder or intentional bodily injury. In the case of murder, qisas gives the right to take the life of the killer, if the latter is convicted and the court approves. Those who are entitled to "qisas" have the option of receiving monetary compensation ("diyya") or granting pardon to the person instead.

Hylarana

Hylarana is a genus of true frogs. They are also called golden-backed frogs. They live in tropical Asia. Scientists used to put 84 to 96 valid species in "Hylarana", but they looked at the frogs again. Today, scientists say four species are in "Hylarana".

"Hylarana" frogs can be small or large. Male frogs are from their noses to the ends of their bodies, and females are . The nostrils are oval in shape and there is a piece of skin on top of them. The ear drum is not covered by skin. They have vomerine teeth and a parietal eye. The toes on their back feet are webbed, but the fingers on the front feet are not.

The frogs that scientists used to say were in "Hylarana" lived everywhere from Sri Lanka to the Western Ghat Mountains in India, through Nepal and southern China and Taiwan, south to Southeast Asia to the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, in Northern Australia, and tropical Africa. The four species of frogs that are still in "Hylarana" today live in southern and southeast Asia.

"Hylarana" is in the subfamily Raninae. They are true frogs, so they are in the family Ranidae. The name "Hylarana" comes from from the New Latin word "hyle" ("wood" or "forest") and "rana" ("frog"). Scientists used to think "Hylarana" was a subgenus of the genus "Rana", but they changed their minds in 2005. In 2006, scientists took "Hylarana" and split it into more genera. They treat these as junior synonyms of "Hylarana". In 2015, Oliver et al. looked closely at "Hylarana" again. They said that only four species are really "Hylarana sensu stricto": The other frogs were moved to "Abavorana", "Amnirana", "Chalcorana", "Humerana", "Hydrophylax", "Indosylvirana", "Papurana", "Pulchrana", and "Sylvirana".

Scientists used to say this genus had 84 to 96 valid species of frogs in it. But they looked closely again. Now, scientists say only four frogs are truly "Hylarana": "Hylarana malayana" was placed in "Hylarana" in 2021.

After these changes, scientists are not sure where a few "Hylarana" species should be placed:

National parks and nature reserves of Israel

The national parks of Israel are historic sites or nature reserves, which are mostly operated by the National Nature and Parks Authority. In 2015, Israel had 81 national parks and more than 400 nature reserves.

Some of the country's most notable parks are located at sites such as Tel Megiddo, Jerusalem and Ashkelon. These include the "Alexander stream" and "Mount Carmel National Park". Several parks and nature reserves have camping options, such as tent grounds and bungalows, open to small groups or campers. The main idea behind these parks and reserves is to guard the values of nature, landscape, heritage, and species.

Following the drying of Lake Hula, the Hula Reserve was established in 1964 and became the first declared nature reserve in Israel. It is a major stopover for birds migrating between Africa, Europe and Asia. In 1963 the Israeli parliament approved the "National parks and nature reserves act", and as a result, two authorities were established: the National Parks Authority and the Nature Reserves Authority. In 1998 the two authorities were merged into one body - Israel Nature and Parks Authority.

In Israel, the difference between national parks and nature reserves is often hard to make. National parks are in most cases centered around archaeological sites, but sometimes include protected nature as well. The nature reserves often contain not just protected flowers, trees and animals, but also archaeological sites of importance.

Master and slave philosophy

"Master and slave" is a theme in philosophy that can be used in different ways. It is explained by the German philosophers Georg W. F. Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche but with different meanings. In philosophy, the words "master" and "slave" are not always meant literally. The theme refers to a hierarchy of certain things or people being put beneath others.

Georg W. F. Hegel wrote about a certain kind of recognition that people need. According to Hegel, people have a need to be recognised as individuals by other individuals. People fill this need by being recognised by others who aren't put beneath them. Part of this happens when people struggle against each other, even to death. People will risk their lives just to struggle for this kind of recognition. However, the outcome of this struggle creates a problem for filling this need. The person who loses the struggle will either die or become beneath the other person. This is taking the part of "slave". When someone puts someone else beneath themself, they take the part of "master". The person who loses the struggle can no longer give or receive the recognition that is needed. Therefore, when someone is put beneath others it damages how they think of themself. But also, when someone puts themselves others, they cannot get the recognition they need from those people anymore.

Hegel's explanation of master and slave has become important in many fields of study. Some examples are in social sciences, discourse analysis, and psychoanalysis. The American researcher David Duquette says the more correct name in English for this philosophy is "lordship and bondage", rather than "master and slave". The American professor Robert Brandom also says that Hegel's explanation represents when duty and authority are split apart. Duties are only given to the "slave" but authority is only given to the "master". The problems of master and slave happen when people try to take one without the other.

Friedrich Nietzsche wrote many warnings about the dangers of morality. Morality is dangerous when it harms the best people and favours the people beneath them, says Nietzsche. He explains master and slave as two different approaches to values and morals. The first approach values noble things like honour, courage, self-worth, and excellence. These people value things based on what they see rather than what they are told. The second approach is what Nietzsche calls a weakness. It values things like sameness and pity. He also calls these "priestly values" because they are often to people by priestly religions. He says the ancient Hebrews were an example of priestly culture, and the ancient Romans were an example of a noble culture.

The "slave revolt in morals" is when the weaker people force their weaker values onto others. This happens when they get resentful about being beneath the stronger people. When these values spread, they favour the weak and priestly people at the cost of the better and nobler people. Nietzsche also says they are life-denying values, meaning they have a negative and unhealthy attitude towards living. They are what make morality dangerous. Nietzsche does not say slave morality is always bad though. Instead, "the ideas of the herd should rule in the herd—but not reach out beyond it". What this means is that weaker values be for the weaker people but for the nobler people. Before Nietzsche, the Russian nihilist Dmitry Pisarev had also said extraordinary people should free themselves from morality and priestly ideas.

A slightly different theme of master and slave is also used by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. It is a main part of his philosophy even though it often stays hidden. Plato says that enslavement is when a person cannot master themselves. When this happens they become a slave to their desires. The opposite of this he calls "self-mastery". He also says that people become mastered by others when they cannot master themselves. For example, people have leaders when they cannot lead themselves. For Plato, the slave and master relation is when something natural and disorderly is put beneath something divine and orderly. For example, Plato says the soul is master of the body. He also says that the world is naturally disorderly, but is turned orderly and scientific only by divine things. Nietzsche instead says there is no divine orderliness that masters the world. According to Nietzsche, the ancient Greeks before Plato already understood this better. These ancient Greeks were able to balance the disorder of Dionysus, and the reasoning of Apollo. He saw Plato as destroying this understanding. And so Nietzsche saw Plato as a coward who couldn't accept reality. Nietzsche's explanation of the master and slave theme is instead based on power, rather than orderliness.

The heat wave first got started in June 1980. A strong high pressure area began building in the central and Southern United States. That allowed the temperatures to soar to almost every day from June to September. This high pressure system acted as a cap on the atmosphere. That prevented thunderstorm development and caused severe drought conditions. But the heat wave broke when the dying Hurricane Allen stopped the weather pattern.

The heat wave and drought led a number of cities in the Midwest and South to have record heat. In Kansas City, Missouri, the high temperature was only below twice. In the same city, the high temperature hit 17 days in a row. In Memphis, Tennessee, the high temperature reached on Sunday, July 13. It was part of a 15-day stretch of temperatures that lasted from July 6 to July 20.

The agricultural damage by the 1980 heat wave and drought was over $20 billion (1980 USD). That allowed the temperatures to soar to almost every day from June to September. This high pressure system acted as a cap on the atmosphere.

In Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, high temperatures exceeded a total of 69 times. Forty-two of those were consecutive days. In Dallas-Fort Worth, the high temperature hit on two days: June 26 and 27.

Indoor cricket

Indoor cricket is a form of cricket that is played in an indoors area much smaller than a regular cricket field. There are multiple versions of indoor cricket, and games can be played with different time lengths. 

The indoor cricket court is a area, with the pitch being long and meters wide except in the area where the bowler delivers the ball. There is a running crease 11 meters away from the batting crease. The batting crease is from the other popping crease.

The batsmen run between their grounds, which are separated by the batting crease and the running crease and the area between these creases, to score runs, with the bowler delivering the ball with part of their front foot behind the bowling crease (which is the popping crease at the bowler's end of the pitch; it is not to be confused with the "wicket line", the indoor cricket term for what regular cricket calls the bowling crease). The bowler is allowed to deliver the ball underarm, but if they do so, the ball must bounce beyond the underarm line. Teams may have less than 11 players.

Bandō prisoner of war camp

Bandō prisoner of war camp was a prisoner of war camp that existed from 1917 to 1920, during and shortly after the First World War. It was located in the city with the same name. It housed about 1000 of the 3900 prisoners of war captured at Tsingtao, China, in 1914. Today, the camp is considered special, because of the liberal rules it had. Many of the prisoners were not professional soldiers, but had other jobs before the war. The commander of the camp, Matsue Toyohisa, saw this, and allowed the prisoners many liberties. One of these liberties was that they were allowed to follow courses to improve their skills. That way, Hermann Richard Hansen directed a choir and an orchestra of prisoners, to perform Beethoven's 9th symphony. This was the first performance of the symphony in Japan and in Asia. When the camp closed in 1920, 63 people chose to stay in Japan.

Anatomical terms of location

Anatomical terms of location have been developed. They help describe the anatomy of animals (including humans). They describe standard positions on an animal. They use Latin and Greek words.

Standard terms let all biological and medical scientists, veterinarians, doctors and anatomists to communicate information about animal bodies and their organs. Much of this information has been standardised in internationally agreed vocabularies for humans (Gray's Anatomy) and animals

For humans, and other animals which stand on two feet (bipeds), terms used are different from animals which stand on four (quadrupeds). Humans are described in the standard anatomical position, which is standing up with arms outstretched. So, what is on "top" of a human is the head, whereas the "top" of a dog may be its back, and the "top" of a flounder could refer to either its left or its right side. Unique terms are used to describe animals without a backbone (invertebrates), because of their wide variety of shapes and symmetry.

Superior means above; inferior means below. In humans it means the head and feet. In animals it means the back and the underneath.

Anterior means the front; posterior means the back.

Medial means the midline; lateral means the sides. The terms "left" and "right" are sometimes used, or their Latin alternatives dexter (right) and sinister (left).

The terms proximal and distal are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to, or distant from, the main mass of the body. Thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal.

"Proximal and distal" are frequently used when describing appendages, such as fins, tentacles, and limbs. 

This terminology is also employed in molecular biology and therefore referring to the atomic position of molecules in a given compound.

Central and peripheral refer to the distance towards and away from the centre of something.

Central describes something close to the centre. For example, the great vessels run centrally through the body; many smaller vessels branch from these.

Peripheral describes something further away from the centre of something. For example, the arm is peripheral to the body.

Deep describes something further away from the surface of the organism.

Superficial describes something near the outer surface of the organism. For example, in skin, the epidermis is superficial to the subcutis.

These two terms, used in anatomy and embryology, describe something at the back ("dorsal") or front/belly ("ventral") of an organism.

The dorsal surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side, of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top.

The ventral surface refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism.

For example, in a fish, the pectoral fins are dorsal to the anal fin, but ventral to the dorsal fin.

Specific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal. To describe how close to the head of an animal something is, three distinct terms are used:


For example, in horses, the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head.

These terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine. 

In humans, "cranial" and "cephalic" are used to refer to the skull, with "cranial" being used more commonly. The term "rostral" is rarely used in human anatomy, apart from embryology, and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism. Similarly, the term "caudal" is used more in embryology and only occasionally used in human anatomy. This is because the brain is at the superior part of the head whereas the nose is in the anterior part. Thus, the "rostrocaudal axis" refers to a C shape (see image above).

Manu is a 10-year-old apprentice fairy godmother who lives under the guidance of her grandmother, an experienced retired fairy, in the enchanted kingdom. Her magic wand is an umbrella, and with it Manu will have to learn to study magic, fulfill wishes and face the witch Valkyrie who always tries to dominate the kingdom with some crazy plan. Manu counts on the help of the frog Duque and the troubled João in their disastrous adventures.

The soundtrack is composed by the guitarist Alessandro Penezzi and is entirely based on choro and its aspects.

Manu is the newest Fairy Godmother of the Enchanted Kingdom. Her grandmother, an experienced and powerful Fairy, is retiring and Manu came to take the job with her magic wand, which is actually a colorful umbrella. She has all the qualities needed to become a great Fairy Godmother: she is brave, impetuous, she has a great heart and plenty of energy to get her hands dirty and help others. However, Manu thinks he already knows everything. Her excitement and anxiety is so great that she wants to take action right away. She runs over and ends up taking actions that only make the situation worse and then she has to double her efforts to correct her mistakes.
João - João is paranoid, afraid and scared. But his persecution mania is justified, after all, he has been the target of witches, stepmothers and giants countless times. He knows a lot about the Enchanted Kingdom. And, despite exaggerating the dangers and inflating the world's problems, it serves as a source of information in the daily life of SOS Fairy Manu.

Duke is the most rogue frog in the Kingdom. He invented his name and title to convince the world that he is a bewitched Prince. His speech makes him charming, with his cleverness and his soft words, he gets everything he wants. He has a hope that when Manu officially becomes the Fairy Godmother of the Kingdom, she will turn him into a handsome, easy-living prince.

The Witch Valquíria, like Manu, inherited her position in the Enchanted Kingdom from her grandmother. Her ambition has no limits: she wants to become the best witch of all time. In other words: she wants to be the worst witch of all time. His greatest joy is to cause fear in the inhabitants of the Kingdom. And his weakness is being extremely vain. It has thousands of creams and potions for skin and hair.

Granny is Manu's grandmother. She is a retired and experienced fairy, who usually helps her granddaughter with some spell problems.
Alfredo - Manu's father. He is a naive and clumsy man who is always in a good mood. It always comes up with a new job every episode.

Decision stream graph

Decision stream is a directed acyclic graph of decision rules for classification and regression tasks (Fig. 1). This decision tree based method avoids the problem of data exhaustion in terminal nodes by merging of leaves from the same/different levels of predictive model. 
Decision stream provides:
– High accuracy due to the precise splitting of data with unpaired two-sample test statistics.

– Decrease of overfitting due to partition of data only into statistically representative groups.

– Reduction of complexity on every level of predictive model.

– Self-regulated depth of predictive model.

Great Bitter Lake

The Great Bitter Lake (; transliterated: al-Buhayrah al-Murra al-Kubra) is a saltwater lake in Egypt. Today, it is part of the Suez Canal, which connects it to the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. It is connected to the Small Bitter Lake (Arabic: البحيرة المرة الصغرى; transliterated: al-Buhayrah al-Murra as-Sughra), through which the canal also runs. Before the canal was built (1869), the site was a dry salt valley or basin. Even the ancient Pyramid Texts mention it. Ships traveling through the Suez Canal use the Great Bitter Lake as a "passing lane", where they can change their position in line or turn around.

The place where the Great Bitter Lake is located used to be a dry salt valley. This still influences the salinity of the lake. Starting with the Six-Day War (1967), the Suez Canal was closed for eight years. During this time, the salinity of the lake increased a lot. It depends on how much seawater flows into it from the Red and the Mediterranean seas. Even when the canal is open, the Great Bitter Lake has a salinity level "more than twice" the level of the sea. While this makes it difficult for plant life to exist there, many species (of crabs, for example) migrate from the Red Sea through the area.

As the Suez canal has no locks, sea water flows freely into the lake from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. In general, north of the lakes, the current changes seasonally, it flows to the north in winter, and south in summer. South of the lakes, the current is tidal, changing with the tides in the Red Sea.

Many fish migrate from south to north through the canal. This is known as Lessepsian migration. It means that certain Red Sea species have come to colonize the eastern Mediterranean.

On 14 February 1945, in the last year of World War II, Great Bitter Lake was the site of the Quincy Agreement. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, directly after the Yalta Conference with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, met Saudi Arabia's King Abdulaziz on board the naval cruiser USS "Quincy".

President Roosevelt's interpreter was U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Bill Eddy, who recorded the men's conversation in his book "FDR Meets Ibn Saud". The meeting is the subject of a BBC documentary by Adam Curtis, "called Bitter Lake" (2015).

During the Six-Day War in 1967, the canal was closed. Egypt kept it closed until 1975, trapping 15 ships in the lake. These ships became known as the "Yellow Fleet", because of the desert sands which soon covered their decks. The crews of the ships would eventually organize, share resources, and later set up their own post office and stamp. Two German-flagged ships eventually sailed out of the canal on their own power. Stranded cargo included various perishables (such as eggs and fruit), T-shirts, and a load of toys destined for Woolworth's.

The Son Also Draws

"The Son Also Draws" is the 6th episode of the first season of Family Guy. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on May 9, 1999. The episode is about Chris getting kicked out of the Boy Scouts (the episode calls it "Youth Scouts"). Peter drives the family to Scout headquarters to get Chris back in. During a rest stop at a Native American casino, Lois gambles away the family car. Peter pretends to be a member of the tribe in an attempt to get the car back, and is sent on a vision quest to prove his heritage, giving him and Chris an opportunity to bond.

Chris wants to leave the Youth Scouts but does not want to tell his father Peter. Chris is later kicked out of the Youth Scouts. Peter takes Chris and the family to Manhattan, where the headquarters of the Youth Scouts is. Brian stays at the house and watches "One Day at a Time". He becomes less smart after watching some episodes. 

Peter needs to go to a bathroom, so they go to a Native American casino. Lois gets a gambling addiction and loses the family's car. Peter tries to get the car back by pretending he is a Native American. The Indians who work at the casino tell Peter to go on a vision quest to show that he really is a Native American. Chris goes with Peter into the wilderness. This is so that he can tell Peter he wants to draw instead of be with the Youth Scouts. Peter becomes so hungry in the wilderness that he starts to see talking trees. Fonzie appears in the sky and gets Peter to see Chris as a good artist. Peter and Chris go back to the casino and get their car back. At the end of the episode, the family talks about what Native Americans, Mexicans, and Swedes have achieved in life. Peter then says that "Canada sucks."

"The Son Also Draws" was written by Ricky Blitt. Niel Affleck is the director of the episode. Alex Borstein (voice actor of Lois) helped write the episode. Seth MacFarlane (creator of the show) thought she was helpful on writing for what Lois does in the episode. The part of the story where Lois loses the family's car was based on the movie "Lost in America". The part with Peter trying to be an Indian to get the family car back is similar to real events. People say that they are 1/64th of a Native American so that they can get money from casinoes. Suzie Plakson, Kevin Michael Richardson, Fred Tatasciore, Wally Wingert, Bobby Slayton, Butch Hartman, and Patrick Bristow were guest stars for the episode.

He said that the episode did not have as many "laugh out loud moments" but has more "bolder" humor. Robin Pierson of "The TV Critic" thought that the episode was "very poor" and that the story was not focused. The episode's ending with Peter saying "Canada sucks" made Canadians who watched the episode angry.

The life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of his fortunes and adversities (more known like Lazarillo de Tormes) is an Spanish novel. It was written by an unknown author. It is written in first person and in epistolary style (like an single long letter). Its oldest known editions date from 1554. The book is an autobiographical form of the life of a boy, Lázaro of Tormes, in the 16th century, from his birth and miserable childhood until his wedding, already in the adulthood. It is considered a precursor of the picaresque novel due to elements such as realism, the narration in first person, the itinerant structure, the service to several masters and the moralistic and pessimistic ideology.

"Lazarillo de Tormes" is an ironic and merciless outline of the society of the moment, of which its vices and hypocritical attitudes are shown, especially the ones of the clergymen and religious. There are different hypothesis about its authorship. Probably the author was sympathetic to Erasmian ideas. This motivated the Inquisition to forbid it and, later, to allow its publication, once it was expunged. The work was not published again in its entirety until the 19th century.

Enclosed Alphanumerics

Enclosed Alphanumerics is a Unicode block (a group of symbols in Unicode). It has 160 symbols. Most of the symbols in the block are letters and numbers inside of circles or in parentheses. In the first Unicode plane (Basic Multilingual Plane), the blocks Dingbats and Enclosed CJK Letters and Months have more numbers inside of circles. In the next plane, the block Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement has symbols of letters inside of more circles, parentheses, and squares.

Many of the symbols were made to be used as bullets when writing lists. The numbers and letters in parentheses were made to look like how typewriters showed numbers and letters in circles. Unicode was made to think that the characters in this block look different than similar copyright symbols (for example, the copyright symbol (left) and the enclosed C (right): © and Ⓒ). The circled S (Ⓢ) was used by German missionaries at around 1900 as a symbol for the ditto mark.

Note that the vines the name refers to could also have been blackcurrant. Even today, blackcurrant is called "Vinbär" ("wine-berry") in Swedish. In the north of Germany the name Weinbeere has been used to refer to blackcurrant, since the Middle Ages.The terms Meertrübli or Trübli (small grape) is still present in some southern German dialects, to refer to blackcurrant.

The first reference outside the Sagas is that of Adam of Bremen (1076) in his Gesta Hammaburgensis. He wrote: ""Praeterea unam adhuc insulam recitavit a multis in eo repertam occeano, quae dicitur Winland, eo quod ibi vites sponte nascantur, vinum optimum ferentes. Nam et fruges ibi non seminatas habundare, non fabulosa opinione, sed certa comperimus relatione Danorum."" This can be translated as: ""In addition [the king of the Danes] reports on one of many islands in the ocean, which is called Winland, because vines grow there wild, which produce wine. That there are fruit in abundance which have non been [planted], we have not known from an incredible rumour, but from the report of the Danes.""

However, other accounts of the work have led historians to produce what is likely to have been in the missing segments. Along with this poem, there exists three other works chronicling the life of El Cid: "Mocedades de Rodrigo" (circa 1360), the "Cantar de Roncesvalles" (circa 1270), and an epitaph, the "Epitafio épico del Cid" (circa 1400).

The poem has literary significance, and is credited with being the original work of the discipline of the study of Spanish literature: the study has been given credit to historian Ramón Menéndez Pidal (1869-1968), who sparked interest in the work and popularized the study of Spanish literature.

Cruel Story of Youth


Teairra Marí

Teairra Marquisha Thomas (born December 2, 1987) professionally known as Teairra Marí, is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, actress and model.

Marí was discovered by the American music mogul Jay Z while she was 16 years old. Jay Z signed her under his label Roc-A-Fella records. In the same year, she released her debut album, titled ‘Roc-A-Fella Records Presents Teairra Mari’, which turned out to be a major debacle. It was a critical success but struggled in garnering the expected sales numbers. This failure threatened to destroy her musical career even before it started and she exited from the label during the production of her second album. A few years later, she got another chance to redeem her career with the single ‘Hunt 4 U’, and its success enabled her to approach studios to produce her second album. It was eventually released with the title ‘At that Point’. She embarked into acting in 2009 with the film ‘The Magnificent Cooly-T’. Thereafter, she appeared in another film ‘Lottery Ticket’ in 2010. She has also released some mix tapes featuring some well known artists of this era and has tasted success with her latest album, ‘Night Shift’ which was released in 2017.

According to Teairra, she was in an-again-off-again relationship for nine years with Brandy Norwood's brother Ray J. In September 2014, Ray J claimed that Teairra was physically abusive to him during their relationship. In 2011, Teairra was arrested in Beverly Hills, California for allegedly assaulting a police officer. In July 2015, Mari was charged with battery after her Uber driver alleged that she punched him and stole his phone charger after he originally declined to let her charge her phone in his car. Nonetheless, the court case had ended in a mistrial when the judge had to excuse himself due to illness in early 2017.

Coal forest

Coal forests were huge areas of wetlands which covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas in the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times. 

At the time most continents were crowded together in the supercontinent Gondwana. They lay on the path of tropical rainfall. As vegetable matter from these forests decayed, enormous deposits of peat accumulated, which later changed into coal. Now those continents are wide apart, but they have the coalfields which those ancient forests left behind.

Much of the carbon in the peat deposits produced by coal forests came from photosynthetic splitting of carbon dioxide. This released oxygen into the atmosphere. This increased the oxygen level, perhaps as high as about 35%. This had the effect of making the air more easily breathable by animals with limited respiratory systems. This may explain the size of "Meganeura" compared to modern dragonflies.

The coal forests covered tropical Euramerica (Europe, eastern North America, northwesternmost Africa) and China. Eventually, climate change devastated these tropical rainforests. The so-called Carboniferous rainforest collapse was caused by a cooler drier climate which broke up the rainforest ecosystem. The cause of this change was mountain uplift, no doubt caused by the continental plates squeezing against each other. During most of the rest of Carboniferous times, the coal forests were restricted to North America (such as the Appalachian and Illinois coal basins) and central Europe.

At the very end of the Carboniferous period, the coal forests underwent a resurgence, expanding mainly in eastern Asia, notably China. They never recovered fully in Euramerica. The Chinese coal forests continued to flourish well into Permian times. 


The conditions which led to the late Carboniferous coal measures returned twice later on. These occasions were in part of the Jurassic period, and the Eocene. The later Jurassic left coal measures in parts of Europe and Australia. The Waloon coal measures are where the fossils of "Iguanodon" were found. The coal in Queensland, Australia is from the same time. 

Conditions in the Paleocene and Eocene were also favourable to plant growth. The coal from this time is found in Chile, Nepal and in the so-called Eocene Okanagan Highlands in British Columbia and Washington State.

Arsphenamine

Arsphenamine, also known as Salvarsan or compound 606, is a drug. It was introduced at the beginning of the 1910s. It was the first effective treatment for syphilis and African trypanosomiasis. This organoarsenic compound was the first modern antimicrobial {antibiotic} agent.

Arsphenamine was first synthesized in 1907 in Paul Ehrlich's lab by Alfred Bertheim. 

The antisyphilitic activity of this compound was discovered by Sahachiro Hata in 1909. He surveyed hundreds of newly synthesized organic arsenical compounds. Ehrlich thought that by screening many compounds, a drug could be discovered which would have anti-microbial activity but not kill the patient.

Ehrlich's laboratory developed a more soluble (but slightly less effective) arsenical compound, Neosalvarsan (neoarsphenamine), which was easier to prepare.

Hawk Junction

Hawk Junction is a community with a local services board in the Canadian province of Ontario, found just north of Highway 101, about east of Wawa.

The community was made by people of Italian, Scottish and French ancestry in 1909 when the Algoma Central Railway was made through the area. In 1923-1924 it was destroyed by fire. The community was rebuilt and is now a terminal for the Algoma Central Railway.

In September 2017, the last business, the Big Bear Hotel closed, leaving Hawk Junction without any services. Residents had needed to drive to the town of Wawa for any services. It is a popular starting point for wilderness hunting and fishing trips. During the winter Hawk Junction is a major snowmobile drop off point. The Big Bear has now recently reopened its doors under a new owner.

Wawa, Ontario

Wawa is a township in the Canadian province of Ontario, located within the Algoma District and associated with Wawa Lake. Previously known as the township of Michipicoten, after a nearby river of that name, the township was officially renamed in 2007 for its largest community of Wawa.

This area was first made for fur trading. In the late 19th century, both gold and iron ore were found and mined, leading to the region's rise as the steel industry developed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. From 1900 to 1918 the Helen Mine had the highest production of iron ore of any mine in Canada.

The township includes the smaller communities of Michipicoten and Michipicoten River, which are small port settlements on the shore of Lake Superior. These names are from the Ojibwe term for the river.

Population trend:

The municipal council is made up of one mayor and four councillors. The current mayor is Ron Rody. Councillors Tamara Liddle, Bill Chiasson, James Neufeld and Yvan Besner were elected on October 27, 2014 for four years. After James Neufeld resigned on April 27, 2015, Matthew Morrison was appointed to fill the empty seat on August 10, 2015. In 2016, Councillor Tamara Liddle and her husband, Gerry Liddle were investigated and it was revealed that both Gerry Liddle and Councillor Tamara Liddle harassed CAO Chris Wray to try and get a personal benefit to avoid paying taxes. Both were punished by town council. After the 2018 elections, Ron Rody was victorious as mayor and the following councillors were elected: Bill Chiasson, Mitch Hatfield, Robert Reece, and Pat Tait.

The community is known for its 8.5-metre (28-foot) metal statue of a Canada goose, which was built in 1960, and was dedicated to the community in 1961. Wawa takes its name from the Ojibwe word for "wild goose", "wewe". Wawa was called wild goose in "The Song of Hiawatha." On July 5, 2010, the Canada Post made a commemorative stamp of the Wawa Goose as part of its Roadside Attractions collection. On July 1, 2017, a new Wawa Goose was made to replace the second aging goose.

The town is also known for snowmobiling and sport fishing. The Voyageur Hiking Trail passes through the town. One important shopping location is Young's General Store, home of the locally famous Pickle Barrel.

Territory (animal)

In ethology, territory is the area that a species of animal consistently defends against related animals. Sometimes it means areas defended against animals of other species. Animals that defend territories in this way are referred to as territorial.

Territoriality is not shown by most species. More commonly, a group of animals has an area that they use but do not necessarily defend. This is called their home range. The home ranges of different groups of animals often overlap, and in the overlap areas, the groups tend to avoid each other. 

Many animals use vocalisations to advertise their territory. These are short-term signals given only when the animal is present. The sound can travel long distances and through various habitats. Examples include birds, frogs and canids.

Scent markings are used by many mammals. Some have special scent glands; others squirt urine on key places. Domestic cats have graded ritualized aggression. This starts off with vocalizations and sometimes mounts to direct attack.

Territories may be held by an individual, a mated or unmated pair, or a group, and it may vary at different times of the year.

Hypergamy

Hypergamy is the practice of dating or marrying someone of a higher social status than oneself. Hypergamy is usually associated with women. Some sociologists believe that harems formerly existed because of female hypergamy. Some analysts also believe that people have twice as many female ancestors as male ancestors because of female hypergamy.

For the better part of human history, women simply didn’t have the option, access, or legal rights in many places in the world to have agency over their own welfare and to create financial independence. So, they relied on a 'good marriage' to secure their (and their children’s) overall prosperity and prospects.

While many Western societies have progressed to promote gender equality in the past century—attempting to creating equal career, educational, and financial opportunities for women—there's still a large gender pay gap. For example, in the United States, women are paid roughly 82 cents for every dollar a man makes for the same job, and the disparity is even greater for women of color, according to the American Association of University Women.

Collie

Collies form a type of herding dogs, including many similar landraces and standardized breeds. The type began in Scotland and Northern England. Collies are usually medium-sized, fairly lightly-built dogs, with pointed noses. Many breeds have a white color over the shoulders. Collies are very active, and most types of collies are excellent at herding. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America), and have then made many varieties, sometimes mixed with other dog types (cross breeding, for example, the Borador). Some collie breeds are still used as working dogs for herding cattle, sheep, and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the American Kennel Club has a breed they call "collie", in fact "collie dogs" are a type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major differences between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports: the herding dogs show good agility, stamina and trainability and behaviour.

Common use of the name "collie" in some areas is limited to certain breeds — the name means Rough Collie in parts of the United States, and Border Collie in many parts of Great Britain. Most collie dog types do not actually include "collie" in their name (see Welsh Sheepdog at right).

Welsh Sheepdog

The Welsh Sheepdog (, ) is a herding dog breed from Wales. Some people incorrectly call a Welsh Sheepdog a Welsh Collie - usually 'Welsh Collie' is used for a cross between a Welsh Sheepdog and a Border Collie, which is often a milder dog and easier to manage than the pure breed.

Like other types of working dog, Welsh Sheepdogs are normally bred for their herding abilities rather than appearance, and so they are different in build, colour and size. Welsh Sheepdogs are the collie type, usually black-and-white, red-and-white or tricolour, and merle markings may occur over any of these combinations. The coat may be short or fairly long, and the ears are pricked, but usually folded at the tip. They are longer in leg, broader in chest and wider in muzzle than the Border Collie. They are extremely active and intelligent, and therefore need much exercise and mental stimulation, if they are to be kept as pets.

Over many decades the Welsh Sheepdog has mostly been replaced for working sheep in Wales by the Border Collie, a standardised breed. However, in more recent years, efforts have been made to keep the Welsh Sheepdog as a variety.

Welsh Sheepdogs are usually "loose-eyed", not scaring the stock with their eyes like the "" Border Collie. They are able to work freely without being under human control. Welsh Sheepdogs are most often used for herding sheep, but also work cattle, goats, and even horses and pigs. They were often in the past used as a droving dog to take cattle and sheep to markets in Britain.

The Welsh Sheepdog is generally healthy, but can be infected by things most other herding breeds are infected by, such as:

• Atopic Dermatitis, which seems to be more common indoors for this breed. It causes irritation to the dog's skin.

• Collie Eye Anomaly, which is very common with collie breeds. It causes sight loss.

• Epilepsy, a brain disorder which causes seizures.

• Hip dysplasia, which makes the hip go weak. Mostly in growing dogs.

• Diabetes, which is not listed for the dog breed being more likely to get, but there are increasing numbers of this. It causes weight loss, and makes the dog urinate more.

The Welsh Sheepdog needs about three cups of dry food each day, which costs between $1.20 and $1.40. The monthly cost of this is about $35, but this can go to $45.

Bearded Collie

The Bearded Collie, or Beardie, is a herding breed of dog once used mostly by Scottish shepherds, but now mostly a popular family pet.

Bearded Collies have an average weight of . Males are around tall at the shoulders while females are around tall.

The Bearded Collie's legend is that Kazimierz Grabski, a Polish merchant, traded some grain for sheep in Scotland in 1514 and brought six Polish Lowland Sheepdogs to move the sheep. A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the herding ability of the dogs that he traded several sheep for several dogs. The Polish sheepdogs were bred with local Scottish dogs to produce the Bearded Collie. It is generally agreed that Mrs. G. Olive Willison founded the modern Bearded Collie in 1944 with her brown female, Jeannie of Bothkennar. Jeannie was meant to be a Shetland Sheepdog, but Mrs. Willison was given a Bearded Collie by accident. She was so interested by the dog that she wanted to begin breeding, so she began looking for a male dog for Jeannie. While walking along the beach, Mrs. Willison met a man who was emigrating from Scotland; she became the owner of his grey dog, David, who became Bailie (also anglicized as Bailey) of Bothkennar. Bailie and Jeannie of Bothkennar are the makers of the modern breed; there are only a few other blood lines, preserved in large part by the perseverance of Mr. Nicolas Broadbridge (Sallen) and Mrs. Betty Foster (Bredon). These are based on Turnbull's Blue—a Bearded Collie from working stock, registered in the International Sheep Dog Society when it still registered non-Border Collies. He bred three litters of Bearded Collies. The breed became popular during the last half of the 20th century—helped, in part, by Potterdale Classic at Moonhill, a Bearded Collie who won Best in Show at Crufts in 1989. The Bearded Collie Club celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2005. The bearded collie is good natured and is good as a family pet and a working dog and a show dog.

The average longevity (the age at which half of the dogs has died and half is still alive) of Bearded Collies from recent UK and USA/Canada surveys is 12.8 years. Beardies in the UK surveys lived longer (average ~13.4 years) than the USA/Canada bearded collies. (median 12.0 years). Most breeds have average longevities between 10 and 13 years and most breeds similar in size to Bearded Collies have average longevities between 11 and 13 years, so the lifespan of Bearded Collies appears to be higher than other breeds (at least in the UK). In a 1996 USA/Canada survey, 32% of Beardies died (including accidental deaths) before the age of nine; however, 12% lived longer than 14 years. The oldest of the 278 deceased dogs in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey died at 19.5 years;

The commonest causes of death among Beardies in the UK are old age (26%), cancer (19%), cerebrovascular disease (9%), and chronic kidney failure (8%). The highest causes of death among Beardies in the US and Canada are old age (18%), cancer (17%), kidney failure (8%), cerebrovascular disease (4%) and hypoadrenocorticism (4%). These are similar to each other.

Bearded Collie owners in the UK said that the most common health issues among living dogs were musculoskeletal—mostly arthritis and cruciate ligament rupture—gastrointestinal (primarily colitis and diarrhea) and urologic diseases. Beardie owners in the US and Canada reported that the most common health problems were hypothyroidism, cancer, Addison's disease, arthritis and skin problems. Morbidity in the two studies is not easily compared, however; the UK report grouped diseases, while the USA/Canada report used more detailed conditions.

More existing breed causes of death for the Bearded Collie include: Skin conditions, such as pemphigus foliaceous and black skin disease, follicular dysplasia, musculoskeletal conditions such as congenital elbow luxation, ocular conditions, such as corneal dystrophy, cataract and generalized progressive retinal atrophy.

Hypoadrenocorticism (also known as Addison's disease) is a disease in Bearded Collies. It occurs when the adrenal cortex produces less then needed numbers of glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid hormones. It affects approximately 2–3.4% of Bearded Collies in the USA/Canada, and causes the death of at least 1% of Bearded Collies in the UK. These are higher percentages than for the average dog population (0.1%), and hypoadrenocorticism causes of deaths among young dogs. Early symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions. Symptoms include unexplained lethargy, frequent gastric disturbances, or an inability to tolerate stress. With medication, most dogs can live a normal life.

Andean mountain cat

The Andean cat, Andean highland cat or Andean mountain cat ("Leopardus jacobita") is a small wild cat that lives in the Andes mountain range. They live in Peru, Bolivia, northern Argentina and northern Chile.

The adult Andean cat is 57 to 64 cm long from its nose to the end of its body, and its tail is another 41 to 48 cm long. It is about 36 cm tall and weighs between 4 and 6 kg. Its fur is gray with places that are brown and some stripes. Its hairs can be 5 cm long. Young cats have lighter fur than adult cats. Young Andean cats look like pampas cats, which live in the same places as the Andean cat.

It eats many different kinds of small animals, for example lizards and birds. Its main food is the mountain vizcacha. Its main food used to be the mountain chinchilla, but most of the chinchillas are dead now and the ones that are a live do not live where the Andean cat lives. This cat likes to live in rocky, open places more than it likes forests.

The Andean cat is in danger of dying out because humans are using or want to use the land that it lives on, breaking its living space into small pieces so that it has to cross roads and other human areas to get from place to place. It is endangered because many of the animals it eats are gone. It is endangered because humans like to catch it for its fur. It is also endangered because the Andean cat and its body parts is important to traditional medicine in Peru and in religious ceremonies for some of the indigenous people of the Andes.

One of the episodes of the first season, Abhinetri, telecasted in 1998, generated a very high TRP for the show. The episodes of first, second and fifth seasons were half-hourly, while episodes of third, fourth and sixth seasons were one-hourly. The sixth season was premiered on 18 February 2015, featuring Shakti Anand and ended on 4 August 2015.

The first season was mostly a crime genre with infrequent episodes on the supernatural. After the first season, each story focused on a different aspect of paranomal activity, such as ghosts, zombies, phantoms, undead persons, possessed objects and witches and wizards.

<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>

"Aahat" was first shot in 1994 as a suspense thriller, and began broadcast on 5 October 1995, each story being divided across two episodes. The season aired on Thursday nights, later changing it to every Friday nights. 

Due to the popularity of the first season, Sony TV decided to bring back the series in its second season. The second season aired on Friday nights. The episode format was same as of the first season. This time the season failed to gain TRP ratings.

The third season was titled as "Aahat: Dahshat Ki Teesri Dastak" (English: "An approaching sound: The Third Coming of Horror"). The season aired on Saturday nights, each story being shown in a single episode. This time too the season didn't manage to gain TRP ratings and the season was shut down soon.

The fourth season was titled "Aahat: The All New Series", which aired on every Friday and Saturday nights. In the season, Durjan who was the head of Paranormal And Supernatural Activities Research used to collect powers from the spirits for his boss. He sends Harsh (Chaitanya Choudhury), Raghav (Vishal Gandhi) and Yamini (Krystle D'Souza) to deal with a new supernatural power every week with the story being divided into two episodes. The season had three crossover episodes with the series "CID". Once in November 2009, second time in February 2010 and third time in June 2010. This time the season managed to gain high TRP ratings and was declared a hit. It is one of the most popular seasons of Aahat.

Due to the huge popularity of the fourth season, Sony TV decided to telecast the series four days a week. The fifth season aired on every Monday to Thursday nights. Every week, two stories were telecast, each story being divided across two episodes. But this idea didn't take off; the TRP ratings dropped once again and the channel had to shut down the series on 25 November 2010.

To celebrate 15 years of the series, this season featured a 16 - episode arc titled "Maut Ka Khel" (English: "The Game of Death") which aired starting 20 September 2010. This was heavily inspired by the 1999 Hollywood horror film House On Haunted Hill. The storyline follows celebrities (Sidharth Shukla, Roshni Chopra, Aashka Goradia, Vivan Bhatena, Gautam Rode, Ketki Dave, Tanaaz Irani, Bakhtiyaar Irani, Aryan Vaid, Bobby Darling, Karishma Tanna, Sanjeet Bedi and Shahbaz Khan) who lived in a 200-year-old haunted house.

The first episode of the sixth season premiered on 18 February 2015. Initially, the series was aired twice a week on every Wednesday and Thursday nights. The first episode of the series had gained a TRP rating of 2.9. Due to high ratings, the channel decided to telecast the season four days on every Monday to Thursday nights. But after a couple of weeks, the TRP ratings dropped, and the channel had to shut down the season on 4 August 2015.

The first five seasons of the series received positive response but response for the sixth season was quite mixed. Vineeta Kumar of "India TV" stated, "As against everybody's expectations, "Aahat" (season 6) doesn't seem that impressive."

Sweta Kaushal of "Hindustan Times" stated, "The new episode of "Aahat" (season 6) does not scare at all and lives up to all the comic cliches that Indian horror shows have been following till date. At best, it is hilarious."

Vineeta Kumar of "India TV" gave the sixth season 2/5 stars, and further stated, "For all those who would be expecting grand with the elements of horror and spook in it, "Aahat" has come with a slight disappointment."

Sweta Kaushal of "Hindustan Times" giving the same ratings to the sixth season, further stated, "The new episode shows women with bad make-up as the ghosts."

Fireworks Productions was nominated for Best Continuing TV Programme and for Best Thriller/Horror Show Of The Year of Indian Telly Awards in 2002. Sujit Pattnaik and Tanmoy Ghosh won Indian Television Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects in 2010, while Himanshu, Yogen and Kamal were nominated for the same category of the same award in 2005 and 2012, however, winning in 2011.

Polydipsia

Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. The word derives from the Greek πολυδίψιος ("poludípsios") "very thirsty", which is gotten from πολύς ("polús", "much, many") + δίψα ("dípsa", "thirst"). Polydipsia is a symptom in many diseases. It also occurs as a weird behaviour in some animals, such as in birds.

Polydipsia can be a symptom of diabetes mellitus. It is seen in cases of poorly controlled diabetes. Diabetes insipidus can also cause polydipsia.

It can also be caused by a change in the osmolality of the extracellular fluids of the body, hypokalemia, decreased blood volume, and other conditions that create water deficiency.

Polydipsia is a symptom and not a disease in itself. Polydipsia investigations at diagnosing diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus can be useful.

Ngwane V

Ngwane V (also known as Mahlokohla, Bhunu, Hhili; 11 May 1876 - 10 December 1899) was the King of Swaziland from 1895 until his death on 10 December 1899. His parents were Mbandzeni and Labotsibeni Mdluli. He ascended to the throne after a short regency of Queen Mother Tibati Nkambule. He was only 16 years old when he became king. His royal capital was at Zombodze while the Queen Mother's residence was at Lobamba.

Ngwane became the king after the Swaziland convention of 1894. This had led to the classification of Swaziland as a protected state of the South African Republic which was then led by President Paul Kruger. During this time Swaziland had a partial Dutch administration in parallel to Ngwane's administration. The Dutch or European for European interests and Ngwane as head and authority of the Swazi nation. An annual payment was made to Ngwane and Labotsibeni while they were in office from taxes collected and from contributions from concessionaires and taxes.

Ngwane's rule was short. In 1899 the Anglo-Boer war began. It brought to an end the Dutch or Boer partial administration of Swaziland and hence gave way to independence. However Mahlokohla died on 10 December of that year while dancing incwala. This was hidden from the nation until the ceremony was over.

Ngwane was succeeded by his four-month-old son Nkhotfotjeni and his wife Lomawa Ndwandwe. His mother Labotsibeni who had been very influential during his reign continued as queen regent until Sobhuza was crowned in 1921. Ngwane's reign gave way to a stable territory surrounded by conflicting states. Today Mahlokohla is named for one of the main streets, "Mahlokohla Street" in Swaziland's capital Mbabane.

Mbandzeni

Mbandzeni (also known as Dlamini IV, Umbandine, Umbandeen; 1855–1889) was the King of Swaziland from 1875 until 1889. He was the son of Mswati II and Nandzi Nkambule. His mother, the wife of King Mswati, died when he was very young.

Mbandzeni became king because his half brother Ludvonga II died before he could become the king. Ludvonga's death resulted in his mother Inkhosikati Lamgangeni adopting Mbandzeni, who was motherless, as her son. That made him king and her the queen mother of Swaziland.

His royal capital was at Mbekelweni. During his kingship, Mbandzeni granted many mining, farming, trading and administrative concessions to white settlers from Britain and the Transvaal. These concessions granted with the help of Offy Sherpstone eventually led to the conventions of 1884 and 1894. Those reduced the overall borders of Swaziland and later made Swaziland a protectorate of the South African Republic. During a period of concessions preceded by famine around 1877 some of the tindvunas (governors) from within Swaziland like Mshiza Maseko and Ntengu kaGama Mbokane were given permission by King Mbandzeni to relocate to farms towards the Komati River. Mshiza Maseko later settled in a place called eLuvalweni, where he was later buried.

Mbandzeni, still in command of a large Swazi army of more than 15000 men aided the British in defeating Sekhukhune in 1879 and preventing Zulu incursion into the Transvaal during the same year. As a result, he guaranteed his country's independence and international recognition despite the Scramble for Africa which was taking place at the time.

Mbandzeni died after an illness in 1889 and is quoted to have said in his deathbed "the Swazi kingship dies with me". He was buried at the royal cemetery at Mbilaneni alongside his father and grandfather Sobhuza I. Mbandzeni was succeeded by his young son Mahlokohla and his wife Queen Labotsibeni Mdluli after a 5-year regency of Queen Tibati Nkambule.

Today a number of buildings and roads in Swaziland are named after Mbandzeni. Among these are the Mbandzeni house in Mbabane and the Mbandzeni Highway to Siteki.

Battleship Potemkin

Battleship Potemkin (, "Bronenosets Potyomkin"), sometimes spelled as Battleship Potyomkin is a 1925 silent drama Russian movie directed by Sergei Eisenstein. The movie is about a ship crew rebelling against their officers on the "Battleship Potemkin" and the events that follow. The film is often considered one of the best movies ever made.

The film is set in 1905 and is divided into five acts. The "Potemkin" is part of the Imperial Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet.

This opening act shows the poor conditions of the crew. Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk are two sailors who talk about the revolution. They want the sailors of the ship to join the revolution. Sailors are sleeping in their hammocks, and an officer beats a sailor. On deck, there appears to be rotten meat. The sailors complain about it and their low rations and refuse to eat it.

The men who did not eat meat are ordered to be killed by a firing squad. The sailors with rifles lower their weapons and do not shoot. This is when the uprising starts. Sailors throw officers overboard and take over the ship. However, the leader Vakulinchuk is killed.

The "Potemkin" goes to the shores of Odessa. Sailors display Vakulinchuk's body in public. The people are sad but inspired. They start getting upset about the Tsar and his government. The sailors say goodbye and praise Vakulinchuk as a hero.

Many people have come to see the sailors and say goodbye. Suddenly soldiers (Cossack) start shooting at the people on the steps. They continue to march down the steps and shoot at men, women, and children. A baby carriage rolls down the steps, and a woman shot in the face with broken glasses is shown. The people cry out to the soldiers. In response, sailors of "Potemkin" shoot at the Opera House. There was a meeting there with Tsarist military leaders.  

The sailors go out into the sea to face the fleet of the Tsar. The sailors of the other ships do not open fire. Instead, they cheer the "Potemkin" on.


Eisenstein wanted the movie to be a propaganda film. Eisenstein wanted viewers to feel sorry for the sailors and support their rebellion. The film was created very emotionally. This was so viewers could sympathize with the characters. Eisenstein uses a lot of montage editing to create emotional effects. Eisenstein was unhappy that not many people watched the movie in Russia. 

The Odessa Steps sequence is a very famous scene in cinema. It is a classic example of montage theory. It has influenced other movies. 

Many other movies reference to or parody the scene. 

Films that refer to the scene:


Films that parody the scene: 


There were not too many showings of the film in Russia. In other countries, the movie was controversial at the time. Countries like England, France, Germany and United States banned the movie for some time. Countries were worried that soldiers and sailors would apply the film and rebel against officers. Countries also thought the movie was too violent. 

Modern critics praise the film as one of the best. The film has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film has a 97% rating on Metacritic. Critics say it is the best in Russian Cinema and that its montage editing is influential. Brussel's World Fair named the film the greatest film of all time in 1958. In 1952, the "Sight & Sound" magazine ranked the film fourth best out of all films. It got 11th place in the same 2012 poll. The film was also ranked the 11th best film at the British Film Institute poll.

There, a fast-flowing river spread out over a flat plain. At this time, the continents were still quite close together, and tropical climates were usual.

These rocks have a nonmarine Oldman Formation below and the marine (saltwater) Bearpaw Formation above. So they were low-lying and often submerged.

Remains of other animals such as fish, turtles, and crocodilians, and plants, are also abundant. The formation has been named after Dinosaur Provincial Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where the formation is well exposed in the badlands that flank the Red Deer River.

When Sobhuza died, Mswati inherited the kingdom. At that time, it was from present day Barberton in the north and included the Nomahasha district in Mozambique. Mswati's became a strong military power after Mswati and his brothers Fokoti, Somcuba and Malambule stopped fighting each other.

When Mswati's armies attacked other Bantu armies or nations, they stole cattle and captured people instead of trying to make the other people's territory part of their kingdom. Around this time, the Trekboers became the first Europeans to meet any Swazis.
